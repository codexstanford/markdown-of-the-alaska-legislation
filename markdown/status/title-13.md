###### Sec. 13.12.102.   Share of spouse.

###### Sec. 13.12.103.   Share of heirs other than surviving spouse.

A part of the intestate estate not passing to the decedent's surviving spouse under AS 13.12.102, or the entire intestate estate if there is no surviving spouse, passes in the following order to the individuals designated below who survive the decedent:

(1) to the decedent's descendants by representation;

An individual who fails to survive the decedent by 120 hours is considered to have predeceased the decedent for purposes of homestead allowance, exempt property, and intestate succession, and the decedent's heirs are determined accordingly. If it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that an individual who would otherwise be an heir survived the decedent by 120 hours, it is considered that the individual failed to survive for the required period. This section is not to be applied if its application would result in a taking of intestate estate by the state under AS 13.12.105.

###### Sec. 13.12.105.   No taker.

If there is no taker under this chapter,

(1) personal property in the intestate estate passes to the state and is subject to AS 34.45.280§34.45.780; if notice to heirs, substantially equivalent to that required by AS 34.45.310, has been given by the personal representative or other person, AS 34.45.310 does not apply;

(1) surviving descendants in the generation nearest to the decedent that contains one or more surviving descendants; and

(2) deceased descendants in the same generation who left surviving descendants, if any.

(b) Under (a) of this section, each surviving descendant in the nearest generation is allocated one share, and the remaining shares, if any, are combined and then divided in the same manner among the surviving descendants of the deceased descendants as if the surviving descendants who were allocated a share and their surviving descendants had predeceased the decedent.

(c) If, under AS 13.12.103(3) or (4), all or part of a decedent's intestate estate passes by representation to the descendants of the decedent's deceased parents or either of them or to the descendants of the decedent's deceased paternal or maternal grandparents or either of them, the estate or part of the estate passing is divided into as many equal shares as there are

(1) surviving descendants in the generation nearest the deceased parents or either of them, or the deceased grandparents or either of them, that contains one or more surviving descendants; and

(2) deceased descendants in the same generation who left surviving descendants, if any.

(d) Under (c) of this section, each surviving descendant in the nearest generation is allocated one share, and the remaining shares, if any, are combined and then divided in the same manner among the surviving descendants of the deceased descendants as if the surviving descendants who were allocated a share and their surviving descendants had predeceased the decedent.

(a) If an individual dies intestate as to all or a portion of the individual's estate, property the decedent gave during the decedent's lifetime to an individual who, at the decedent's death, is an heir is treated as an advancement against the heir's intestate share only if

(1) the decedent declared in a contemporaneous writing or the heir acknowledged in writing that the gift is an advancement; or

(2) the decedent's contemporaneous writing or the heir's written acknowledgment otherwise indicates that the gift is to be taken into account in computing the division and distribution of the decedent's intestate estate.

(b) For purposes of (a) of this section, property advanced is valued as of the time the heir came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of the decedent's death, whichever first occurs.

(c) If the recipient of the property fails to survive the decedent, the property is not taken into account in computing the division and distribution of the decedent's intestate estate, unless the decedent's contemporaneous writing provides otherwise.

###### Sec. 13.12.110.   Debts to decedent.

A debt owed to a decedent is not charged against the intestate share of any individual except the debtor. If the debtor fails to survive the decedent, the debt is not taken into account in computing the intestate share of the debtor's descendants.

###### Sec. 13.12.111.   Alienage.

An individual is not disqualified to take as an heir because the individual or another individual through whom the individual claims is or has been an alien.

###### Sec. 13.12.113.   Individuals related to decedent through two lines.

An individual who is related to the decedent through two lines of relationship is entitled to only a single share based on the relationship that would entitle the individual to the larger share.

(b) An adopted individual is the child of the individual's adopting parent or parents and not of the individual's natural parents, but adoption of a child by the spouse of either natural parent does not affect

(1) the relationship between the child and that natural parent; or

(2) the right of the child or a descendant of the child to inherit from or through the other natural parent.

(c) Inheritance from or through a child by either natural parent or the natural parent's kindred is precluded unless that natural parent has openly treated the child as the natural parent's child, and has not refused to support the child.

(d) To the extent there is a conflict between this section and either AS 25.20.050 or AS 25.23.130, this section controls.

###### Sec. 13.12.209.   Sources from which elective share payable.

(a) In a proceeding for an elective share, the following are applied first to satisfy the elective share amount and to reduce or eliminate any contributions due from the decedent's probate estate and recipients of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others:

(1) amounts included in the augmented estate under AS 13.12.204 that pass or have passed to the surviving spouse by testate or intestate succession, and amounts included in the augmented estate under AS 13.12.206; and

(2) amounts included in the augmented estate under AS 13.12.207, up to two-thirds of the augmented estate.

(b) If, after the application of (a) of this section, the elective share amount is not fully satisfied or the surviving spouse is entitled to a supplemental elective share amount, amounts included in the decedent's probate estate and in the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others, other than amounts included under AS 13.12.205(a)(3)(A) or (C), are applied first to satisfy the unsatisfied balance of the elective share amount or the supplemental elective share amount. The decedent's probate estate and that portion of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others shall be applied so that liability for the unsatisfied balance of the elective share amount or for the supplemental elective share amount is equitably apportioned among the recipients of the decedent's probate estate and of that portion of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others in proportion to the value of the recipients' interests in the decedent's probate estate and that portion of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others.

(c) If, after the application of (a) and (b) of this section, the elective share or supplemental elective share amount is not fully satisfied, the remaining portion of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others shall be applied so that liability for the unsatisfied balance of the elective share or supplemental elective share amount is equitably apportioned among the recipients of that remaining portion of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others in proportion to the value of the recipients' interests in the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others.

###### Sec. 13.12.210.   Personal liability of recipients.

(a) Only original recipients of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others, and the donees of the recipients of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others, to the extent the donees have the property or its proceeds, are liable to make a proportional contribution toward satisfaction of the surviving spouse's elective share or supplemental elective share amount. A person liable to make contribution may choose to give up the person's proportional part of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others or to pay the value of the amount for which the person is liable.

(b) If a provision of AS 13.12.201§13.12.214 is preempted by federal law with respect to a payment, an item of property, or another benefit included in the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others, a person who, not for value, receives the payment, item of property, or other benefit is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of that item of property or benefit, as provided in AS 13.12.209, to the person who would have been entitled to it if that provision were not preempted.

###### Sec. 13.12.211.   Proceeding for elective share; time limit.

(a) Except as provided in (b) of this section, the election shall be made by filing in the court and mailing or delivering to the personal representative, if any, a petition for the elective share within nine months after the date of the decedent's death, or within six months after the probate of the decedent's will, whichever limitation expires later. The surviving spouse shall give notice of the time and place set for hearing to persons interested in the estate and to the distributees and recipients of portions of the augmented estate whose interests will be adversely affected by the taking of the elective share. Except as provided in (b) of this section, the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others are not included within the augmented estate for the purpose of computing the elective share if the petition is filed more than nine months after the decedent's death.

(b) Within nine months after the decedent's death, the surviving spouse may petition the court for an extension of time for making an election. If, within nine months after the decedent's death, the spouse gives notice of the petition to all persons interested in the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others, the court for cause shown by the surviving spouse may extend the time for election. If the court grants the spouse's petition for an extension, the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others are not excluded from the augmented estate for the purpose of computing the elective share and supplemental elective share amounts, if the spouse makes an election by filing in the court and mailing or delivering to the personal representative, if any, a petition for the elective share within the time allowed by the extension.

(c) The surviving spouse may withdraw the surviving spouse's demand for an elective share at any time before entry of a final determination by the court.

(d) After notice and hearing, the court shall determine the elective share and supplemental elective share amounts, and shall order payment of these amounts from the assets of the augmented estate or by contribution as appears appropriate under AS 13.12.209 and 13.12.210. If it appears that a fund or property included in the augmented estate has not come into the possession of the personal representative, or has been distributed by the personal representative, the court nevertheless shall fix the liability of a person who has an interest in the fund or property or who has possession of the fund or the property, whether as trustee or otherwise. The proceeding may be maintained against fewer than all persons against whom relief could be sought, but a person is not subject to contribution in a greater amount than the person would have been under AS 13.12.209 and 13.12.210 if relief had been secured against all persons subject to contribution.

(e) An order or judgment of the court may be enforced as necessary in suit for contribution or payment in other courts of this state or other jurisdictions.

###### Sec. 13.12.212.   Right of election personal to surviving spouse; incapacitated surviving spouse.

(a) The right of election may be exercised only by a surviving spouse who is living when the petition for the elective share is filed in the court under AS 13.12.211(a). If the election is not exercised by the surviving spouse personally, it may be exercised on the surviving spouse's behalf by the surviving spouse's conservator, guardian, or agent under the authority of a power of attorney.

(b) If the election is exercised on behalf of a surviving spouse who is an incapacitated person, the portion of the elective share and supplemental elective share amounts due from the decedent's probate estate and recipients of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others under AS 13.12.209(b) and (c) shall be placed in a custodial trust for the benefit of the surviving spouse under AS 13.60 (Alaska Uniform Custodial Trust Act), except as provided in (c)§(e) of this section. For the purposes of this subsection, an election on behalf of a surviving spouse by an agent under a durable power of attorney is presumed to be on behalf of a surviving spouse who is an incapacitated person. For the purposes of the custodial trust established by this subsection,

(1) the electing guardian, conservator, or agent is the custodial trustee;

(2) the surviving spouse is the beneficiary; and

(3) the custodial trust is determined to have been created by the decedent spouse by written transfer that takes effect at the decedent spouse's death and that directs the custodial trustee to administer the custodial trust as for an incapacitated beneficiary.

(c) An incapacitated beneficiary or a person acting on behalf of an incapacitated beneficiary may not terminate a custodial trust established under (b) of this section; but if the beneficiary regains capacity, the beneficiary then acquires the power to terminate the custodial trust by delivering to the custodial trustee a writing signed by the beneficiary declaring the termination. If not previously terminated, the custodial trust terminates on the death of the beneficiary.

(d) Expenditures by the custodial trustee of the property of a custodial trust established under (b) of this section shall be made with regard to other support, income, and property of the beneficiary and benefits of medical or other forms of assistance from any state or federal government or governmental agency for which the beneficiary must qualify on the basis of need.

(e) Upon the beneficiary's death, the custodial trustee shall transfer the unexpended property of a custodial trust established under (b) of this section in the following order:

(1) under the residuary clause, if any, of the will of the beneficiary's predeceased spouse against whom the elective share was taken, as if the predeceased spouse died immediately after the beneficiary;

(2) to the predeceased spouse's heirs under AS 13.12.711.

###### Sec. 13.12.213.   Waiver of right to elect and of other rights.

(a) The right of election of a surviving spouse and the rights of the surviving spouse to homestead allowance, exempt property, and family allowance, or to any of them, may be waived, wholly or partially, before or after marriage, by a written contract, agreement, or waiver signed by the surviving spouse.

(b) A surviving spouse's waiver is not enforceable if the surviving spouse proves that

(1) the surviving spouse did not execute the waiver voluntarily; or

(2) the waiver was unconscionable when it was executed and, before execution of the waiver, the surviving spouse

(A) was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the decedent;

(B) did not voluntarily and expressly waive, in writing, a right to disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the decedent beyond the disclosure provided; and

(C) did not have, or reasonably could not have had, an adequate knowledge of the property or financial obligations of the decedent.

(c) An issue of unconscionability of a waiver is for decision by the court as a matter of law.

(d) Unless it provides to the contrary, a waiver of "all rights," or equivalent language, in the property or estate of a present or prospective spouse or a complete property settlement entered into after or in anticipation of separation or divorce is a waiver of all rights of elective share, homestead allowance, exempt property, and family allowance by each spouse in the property of the other and a renunciation by each of all benefits that would otherwise pass to the spouse from the other by intestate succession or by virtue of a will executed before the waiver or property settlement.

###### Sec. 13.12.214.   Protection of payors and other third parties.

(a) Although under AS 13.12.205 a payment, item of property, or other benefit is included in the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others, a payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument, or for having taken other action in good faith reliance on the validity of a governing instrument, upon request and satisfactory proof of the decedent's death, before the payor or other third party received written notice from the surviving spouse or spouse's representative of an intention to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed. A payor or other third party is liable for payments made or other actions taken after the payor or other third party received written notice of an intention to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed.

(b) The written notice under (a) of this section of intention to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed shall be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon the payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Upon receipt of written notice of intention to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed, a payor or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit an item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate, or if proceedings have not been commenced, to or with the court located in the judicial district of the decedent's residence. The court shall hold the funds or item of property and, upon its determination under AS 13.12.211(d), shall order disbursement in accordance with the determination. If a petition is not filed in the court within the specified time under AS 13.12.211(a) or, if filed, the demand for an elective share is withdrawn under AS 13.12.211(c), the court shall order disbursement to the designated beneficiary. Payments or transfers to the court or deposits made into court discharge the payor or other third party from all claims for amounts so paid or the value of property so transferred or deposited.

(c) Upon petition to the court by the beneficiary designated in a governing instrument, a court may order that all or part of the property paid or transferred into court under (b) of this section be paid to the beneficiary in an amount and subject to conditions consistent with AS 13.12.201§13.12.214.

#### Article 3. Spouse or Children Unprovided for in Wills.

###### Sec. 13.12.301.   Entitlement of spouse; premarital will.

(a) If a testator's surviving spouse married the testator after the testator executed the testator's will, the surviving spouse is entitled to receive, as an intestate share, no less than the value of the share of the estate the surviving spouse would have received if the testator had died intestate as to that portion of the testator's estate, if any, that neither is devised to a child of the testator who was born before the testator married the surviving spouse and who is not a child of the surviving spouse nor is devised to a descendant of such a child or passes under AS 13.12.603 or 13.12.604 to such a child or to a descendant of such a child, unless

(1) it appears from the will or other evidence that the will was made in contemplation of the testator's marriage to the surviving spouse;

(2) the will expresses the intention that it is to be effective notwithstanding a subsequent marriage; or

(3) the testator provided for the spouse by transfer outside the will and the intent that the transfer be in lieu of a testamentary provision is shown by the testator's statements or is reasonably inferred from the amount of the transfer or other evidence.

(b) In satisfying the share provided by this section, devises made by the will to the testator's surviving spouse, if any, are applied first, and other devises, other than a devise to a child of the testator who was born before the testator married the surviving spouse and who is not a child of the surviving spouse or a devise or substitute gift under AS 13.12.603 or 13.12.604 to a descendant of the child, abate as provided in AS 13.16.540.

###### Sec. 13.12.302.   Omitted children.

(a) Except as provided in (b) of this section, if a testator fails to provide in the testator's will for the testator's children born or adopted after the execution of the will, the omitted after-born or after-adopted child receives a share in the estate as follows:

(1) if the testator did not have a child living when the testator executed the will, an omitted after-born or after-adopted child receives a share in the estate equal in value to that which the child would have received had the testator died intestate, unless the will devised all or substantially all of the estate to the other parent of the omitted child and that other parent survives the testator and is entitled to take under the will;

(2) if the testator had one or more children living when the testator executed the will, and the will devised property or an interest in property to one or more of the then living children, an omitted after-born or after-adopted child is entitled to share in the testator's estate as follows:

(A) the portion of the testator's estate in which the omitted after-born or after-adopted child is entitled to share is limited to devises made to the testator's then living children under the will;

(B) the omitted after-born or after-adopted child is entitled to receive the share of the testator's estate, as limited in (A) of this paragraph, that the child would have received had the testator included all omitted after-born and after-adopted children with the children to whom devises were made under the will and had given an equal share of the estate to each child;

(C) to the extent feasible, the interest granted an omitted after-born or after-adopted child under this section must be of the same character, whether equitable or legal, or present or future, as that devised to the testator's then living children under the will;

(D) in satisfying a share provided by this paragraph, devises to the testator's children who were living when the will was executed abate ratably; in abating the devises of the then living children, the court shall preserve to the maximum extent possible the character of the testamentary plan adopted by the testator.

(b) Neither (a)(1) nor (a)(2) of this section applies if

(1) it appears from the will that the omission was intentional; or

(2) the testator provided for the omitted after-born or after-adopted child by transfer outside the will and the intent that the transfer be in lieu of a testamentary provision is shown by the testator's statements or is reasonably inferred from the amount of the transfer or other evidence.

(c) If at the time of execution of the will the testator fails to provide in the testator's will for a living child solely because the testator believes the child to be dead, the child is entitled to share in the estate as if the child were an omitted after-born or after-adopted child.

(d) In satisfying a share provided by (a)(1) of this section, devises made by the will abate under AS 13.16.540.

#### Article 4. Exempt Property and Allowances.

###### Sec. 13.12.401.   Applicable law.

Except as provided in AS 13.06.068, AS 13.12.401§13.12.405 apply to the estate of a decedent who dies domiciled in this state, and rights to homestead allowance, exempt property, and family allowance for a decedent who dies not domiciled in this state are governed by the law of the decedent's domicile at death.

###### Sec. 13.12.402.   Homestead allowance.

A decedent's surviving spouse is entitled to a homestead allowance of $27,000. If there is no surviving spouse, each minor child and each dependent child of the decedent is entitled to a homestead allowance amounting to $27,000 divided by the number of minor and dependent children of the decedent. The homestead allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims against the estate. Homestead allowance is in addition to a share passing to the surviving spouse or minor or dependent child by the will of the decedent, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession, or by way of elective share.

###### Sec. 13.12.403.   Exempt property.

In addition to the homestead allowance, the decedent's surviving spouse is entitled from the estate to a value, not exceeding $10,000 in excess of security interests in the items, in household furniture, automobiles, furnishings, appliances, and personal effects. If there is no surviving spouse, the decedent's children are entitled jointly to the same value. If encumbered chattels are selected and the value in excess of security interests, plus that of other exempt property, is less than $10,000, or if there is not $10,000 worth of exempt property in the estate, the spouse or children are entitled to other assets of the estate, if any, to the extent necessary to make up the $10,000 value. Rights to exempt property and assets needed to make up a deficiency of exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate, but the right to assets to make up a deficiency of exempt property abates as necessary to permit earlier payment of homestead allowance and family allowance. These rights are in addition to a benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the decedent's will, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession, or by way of elective share.

###### Sec. 13.12.404.   Family allowance.

(a) In addition to the right to homestead allowance and exempt property, the decedent's surviving spouse and minor children whom the decedent was obligated to support and children who were in fact being supported by the decedent are entitled to a reasonable allowance in money out of the estate for their maintenance during the period of administration. The allowance may not continue for longer than one year if the estate is inadequate to discharge allowed claims. The allowance may be paid as a lump sum or in periodic installments. It is payable to the surviving spouse, if living, for the use of the surviving spouse and minor and dependent children; otherwise it is payable to the children, or persons having their care and custody. If a minor child or dependent child is not living with the surviving spouse, the allowance may be made partially to the child or the child's guardian or other person having the child's care and custody, and partially to the spouse, as their needs may appear. The family allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims except the homestead allowance.

(b) The family allowance is not chargeable against a benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the will of the decedent, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession, or by way of elective share. The death of a person entitled to family allowance terminates the right to allowances not yet paid.

###### Sec. 13.12.405.   Source, determination, and documentation.

(a) If the estate is otherwise sufficient, property specifically devised may not be used to satisfy rights to homestead allowance or exempt property. Subject to this restriction, the surviving spouse, guardians of minor children, or children who are adults may select property of the estate as homestead allowance and exempt property. The personal representative may make those selections if the surviving spouse, the children, or the guardians of the minor children are unable or fail to do so within a reasonable time or there is no guardian of a minor child. The personal representative may execute an instrument or deed of distribution to establish the ownership of property taken as homestead allowance or exempt property. The personal representative may determine the family allowance in a lump sum not exceeding $18,000 or periodic installments not exceeding $1,500 per month for one year, and may disburse funds of the estate in payment of the family allowance and any part of the homestead allowance payable in cash. The personal representative or an interested person aggrieved by a selection, determination, payment, proposed payment, or failure to act under this section may petition the court for appropriate relief, which may include a family allowance other than that which the personal representative determined or could have determined.

(b) If the right to an elective share is exercised on behalf of a surviving spouse who is an incapacitated person, the personal representative may add unexpended portions payable under the homestead allowance, exempt property, and family allowance to the trust established under AS 13.12.212(b).

#### Article 5. Wills, Will Contracts, and Custody and Deposit of Wills.

###### Sec. 13.12.501.   Who may make will.

An individual 18 or more years of age who is of sound mind may make a will.

###### Sec. 13.12.502.   Execution; witnessed wills; holographic wills.

(a) Except as provided in (b) of this section, AS 13.06.068, AS 13.12.506, and 13.12.513, a will must be

(1) in writing;

(2) signed by the testator or in the testator's name by another individual in the testator's conscious presence and by the testator's direction; and

(3) signed by at least two individuals, each of whom signs within a reasonable time after the witness witnesses either the signing of the will as described in (2) of this subsection or the testator's acknowledgment of that signature or the will.

(b) Except as provided in AS 13.06.068, a will that does not comply with (a) of this section is valid as a holographic will, whether or not witnessed, if the signature and material portions of the document are in the testator's handwriting.

###### Sec. 13.12.504.   Self-proved will.

(a) A will may be simultaneously executed, attested, and made self-proved, by acknowledgment of the will by the testator and affidavits of the witnesses, each made before an officer authorized to administer oaths under the laws of the state in which execution occurs and evidenced by the officer's certificate, under official seal, in substantially the following form:

(c) A signature affixed to a self-proving affidavit attached to a will is considered a signature affixed to the will, if necessary to prove the will's due execution.

###### Sec. 13.12.505.   Who may witness.

(a) An individual generally competent to be a witness may act as a witness to a will.

(b) The signing of a will by an interested witness does not invalidate the will or a provision of it.

###### Sec. 13.12.506.   Choice of law as to execution.

Except as provided by AS 13.06.068, a written will is valid if executed in compliance with AS 13.12.502 or if its execution complies with the law at the time of execution of the place where the will is executed or of the law of the place where, at the time of execution or at the time of death, the testator is domiciled, has a place of abode, or is a national.

###### Sec. 13.12.507.   Revocation by writing or by act.

(a) A will or a part of a will is revoked

(1) by executing a subsequent will that revokes the previous will or part expressly or by inconsistency; or

(2) by performing a revocatory act on the will, if the testator performed the act with the intent and for the purpose of revoking the will or part of the will or if another individual performed the act in the testator's conscious presence and by the testator's direction; in this paragraph, "revocatory act on the will" includes burning, tearing, canceling, obliterating, or destroying the will or any part of it; a "revocatory act on the will" includes a burning, tearing, or canceling whether or not the burn, tear, or cancellation touched any of the words on the will.

(b) If a subsequent will does not expressly revoke a previous will, the execution of the subsequent will wholly revokes the previous will by inconsistency if the testator intended the subsequent will to replace rather than supplement the previous will.

(c) The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will to replace rather than supplement a previous will if the subsequent will makes a complete disposition of the testator's estate. If this presumption arises and is not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the previous will is revoked; only the subsequent will is operative on the testator's death.

(d) The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will to supplement rather than replace a previous will if the subsequent will does not make a complete disposition of the testator's estate. If this presumption arises and is not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the subsequent will revokes the previous will only to the extent the subsequent will is inconsistent with the previous will; each will is fully operative on the testator's death to the extent they are not inconsistent.

###### Sec. 13.12.508.   Revocation by change of circumstances.

Except as provided in AS 13.12.803 and 13.12.804, a change of circumstances does not revoke a will or a part of it.

###### Sec. 13.12.509.   Revival of revoked will.

(a) If a subsequent will that wholly revoked a previous will is thereafter revoked by a revocatory act under AS 13.12.507(a)(2), the previous will remains revoked unless it is revived. The previous will is revived if it is evident from the circumstances of the revocation of the subsequent will or from the testator's contemporary or subsequent declarations that the testator intended the previous will to take effect as executed.

(b) If a subsequent will that partly revoked a previous will is thereafter revoked by a revocatory act under AS 13.12.507(a)(2), a revoked part of the previous will is revived unless it is evident from the circumstances of the revocation of the subsequent will or from the testator's contemporary or subsequent declarations that the testator did not intend the revoked part to take effect as executed.

(c) If a subsequent will that revoked a previous will in whole or in part is thereafter revoked by another, later, will, the previous will remains revoked in whole or in part, unless it or its revoked part is revived. The previous will or its revoked part is revived to the extent it appears from the terms of the later will that the testator intended the previous will to take effect.

###### Sec. 13.12.510.   Incorporation by reference.

A writing in existence when a will is executed may be incorporated by reference if the language of the will manifests this intent and describes the writing sufficiently to permit its identification.

###### Sec. 13.12.511.   Testamentary additions to trusts.

(a) A will may validly devise property to the trustee of a trust established or to be established

(1) during the testator's lifetime by the testator, by the testator and some other person, or by some other person, including a funded or unfunded life insurance trust, although the settlor has reserved any or all rights of ownership of the insurance contracts; or

(2) at the testator's death by the testator's devise to the trustee, if the trust is identified in the testator's will and its terms are set out in a written instrument, other than a will, executed before, concurrently with, or after the execution of the testator's will or in another individual's will if that other individual has predeceased the testator, regardless of the existence, size, or character of the corpus of the trust.

(b) A devise under (a) of this section is not invalid because the trust is amendable or revocable, or because the trust was amended after the execution of the will or the testator's death.

(c) Unless the testator's will provides otherwise, property devised to a trust described in (a)§(b) of this section is not held under a testamentary trust of the testator, but it becomes a part of the trust to which it is devised, and must be administered and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the governing instrument setting out the terms of the trust, including any amendments to the trust made before or after the testator's death.

(d) Unless the testator's will provides otherwise, a revocation or termination of the trust before the testator's death causes the devise to lapse.

###### Sec. 13.12.512.   Events of independent significance.

A will may dispose of property by reference to acts and events that have significance apart from their effect upon the dispositions made by the will, whether they occur before or after the execution of the will or before or after the testator's death. The execution or revocation of another individual's will is an event covered by this section.

###### Sec. 13.12.513.   Separate writing identifying devise of certain types of tangible personal property.

Whether or not the provisions relating to holographic wills apply, a will may refer to a written statement or list to dispose of items of tangible personal property not otherwise specifically disposed of by the will, other than money. To be admissible under this section as evidence of the intended disposition, the writing must be signed by the testator and must describe the items and the devisees with reasonable certainty. The writing may be referred to as one to be in existence at the time of the testator's death; it may be prepared before or after the execution of the will; it may be altered by the testator after its preparation; and it may be a writing that does not have significance apart from its effect on the dispositions made by the will.

###### Sec. 13.12.514.   Contracts concerning succession.

(a) A contract to make a will or devise, or not to revoke a will or devise, or to die intestate, if executed after January 1, 1997, may be established only by

(1) provisions of a will stating material provisions of the contract;

(2) an express reference in a will to a contract and extrinsic evidence proving the terms of the contract; or

(3) a writing signed by the decedent evidencing the contract.

(b) The execution of a joint will or mutual wills does not create a presumption of a contract not to revoke the will or wills.

###### Sec. 13.12.515.   Deposit of will with court in testator's lifetime.

A will may be deposited by the testator or the testator's agent with a court for safekeeping, under rules of the court. During the testator's lifetime, the will must be kept confidential. During the testator's lifetime, a deposited will shall be delivered only to the testator or to a person authorized in writing signed by the testator to receive the will. A conservator may be allowed to examine a deposited will of a protected testator under procedures designed to maintain the confidential character of the document to the extent possible, and to ensure that it will be kept confidential and on deposit after the examination.

###### Sec. 13.12.516.   Duty of custodian of will; liability.

After the death of a testator and on request of an interested person, a person having custody of a will of the testator shall deliver it with reasonable promptness to a person able to secure its probate and, if the person with custody does not know of a person able to secure the will's probate, to an appropriate court. A person who wilfully fails to deliver a will is liable to a person aggrieved for any damages that may be sustained by the failure. A person who wilfully refuses or fails to deliver a will after being ordered by the court in a proceeding brought for the purpose of compelling delivery is subject to penalty for contempt of court.

###### Sec. 13.12.517.   Penalty clause for contest.

A provision in a will purporting to penalize an interested person for contesting the will or instituting other proceedings relating to the estate is unenforceable if probable cause exists for instituting proceedings.

#### Article 6. Establishment of Will and Trust Validity before Death.

###### Sec. 13.12.530.   Establishment of will validity before death.

A testator, a person who is nominated in a will to serve as a personal representative, or, with the testator's consent, an interested party may petition the court to determine before the testator's death that the will is a valid will subject only to subsequent revocation or modification.

###### Sec. 13.12.535.   Establishment of trust validity before death.

If at least one of the trustees of a trust is a qualified person, the settlor or a trustee of the trust may petition the court to determine before the settlor's death that the trust is valid and enforceable under its terms, subject only to a subsequent revocation or modification of the trust.

###### Sec. 13.12.540.   Venue.

(a) The venue for a petition under AS 13.12.530 is

(1) the judicial district of this state where the testator is domiciled; or

(2) if the person who executed the will is not domiciled in this state, any judicial district of this state.

(b) The venue for a petition under AS 13.12.535 is the judicial district where the trust is registered. The venue for proceedings involving a trust that is not registered in this state is

(1) any place in this state where the trust could have been properly registered; or

(2) the location established by the rules of court.

###### Sec. 13.12.545.   Contents of petition for will validity.

A petition under AS 13.12.530 must contain

(1) a statement that a copy of the will has been filed with the court;

(2) a statement that the will is in writing;

(3) a statement that the will was signed by the testator, or was signed in the testator's name by another person in the testator's conscious presence and at the testator's direction;

(4) in the case of a witnessed will, a statement that the will was signed by at least two individuals, each of whom signed within a reasonable time after witnessing the signing of the will or the testator's acknowledgment of the signature on the will;

(5) in the case of a holographic will, a statement that the signature and material portions of the will are in the testator's handwriting;

A will may provide for the passage of all property the testator owns at death and all property acquired by the estate after the testator's death.

###### Sec. 13.12.603.   Antilapse; deceased devisee; class gifts.

(a) If a devisee fails to survive the testator and is a grandparent, a descendant of a grandparent, or a stepchild of either the testator or the donor of a power of appointment exercised by the testator's will, the following apply:

(1) except as provided in (4) of this subsection, if the devise is not in the form of a class gift and the deceased devisee leaves surviving descendants, a substitute gift is created in the devisee's surviving descendants; the surviving descendants take by representation the property to which the devisee would have been entitled had the devisee survived the testator;

(2) except as provided in (4) of this subsection, if the devise is in the form of a class gift, other than a devise to "issue," "descendants," "heirs of the body," "heirs," "next of kin," "relatives," or "family," or a class described by language of similar import, a substitute gift is created in the surviving descendants of a deceased devisee; the property to which the devisees would have been entitled had all of them survived the testator passes to the surviving devisees and the surviving descendants of the deceased devisees; each surviving devisee takes the share to which the surviving devisee would have been entitled had the deceased devisees survived the testator; each deceased devisee's surviving descendants who are substituted for the deceased devisee take by representation the share to which the deceased devisee would have been entitled had the deceased devisee survived the testator;

(3) for the purposes of AS 13.12.601, words of survivorship, as in a devise to an individual "if the individual survives me," or in a devise to "my surviving children," are not, in the absence of additional evidence, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the application of this section;

(4) if the will creates an alternative devise with respect to a devise for which a substitute gift is created by (1) or (2) of this subsection, the substitute gift is superseded by the alternative devise only if an expressly designated devisee of the alternative devise is entitled to take under the will;

(5) unless the language creating a power of appointment expressly excludes the substitution of the descendants of an appointee for the appointee, a surviving descendant of a deceased appointee of a power of appointment can be substituted for the appointee under this section, whether or not the descendant is an object of the power.

(b) If, under (a) of this section, substitute gifts are created and not superseded with respect to more than one devise and the devises are alternative devises, one to the other, the determination of which of the substitute gifts takes effect is resolved as follows:

###### Sec. 13.12.604.   Failure of testamentary provision.

(a) Except as provided in AS 13.12.603, a devise, other than a residuary devise, that fails for any reason becomes a part of the residue.

(2) another organization acquired as a result of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or other distribution by the organization or a successor, related, or acquiring organization; or

(3) the same organization acquired as a result of a plan of reinvestment.

(b) Distributions in cash before death with respect to a described security are not part of the devise.

###### Sec. 13.12.606.   Nonademption of specific devises.

###### Sec. 13.12.607.   Nonexoneration.

A specific devise passes subject to any mortgage interest existing at the date of death, without right of exoneration, regardless of a general directive in the will to pay debts.

###### Sec. 13.12.608.   Exercise of power of appointment.

In the absence of a requirement that a power of appointment be exercised by a reference, or by an express or specific reference, to the power, a general residuary clause in a will, or a will making general disposition of all of the testator's property, expresses an intention to exercise a power of appointment held by the testator only if

(1) the power is a general power and the creating instrument does not contain a gift if the power is not exercised; or

(2) the testator's will manifests an intention to include the property subject to the power.

###### Sec. 13.12.609.   Ademption by satisfaction.

(a) Property a testator gave in the testator's lifetime to a person is treated as a satisfaction of a devise in whole or in part, only if

(1) the will provides for deduction of the gift;

(2) the testator declared in a contemporaneous writing that the gift is in satisfaction of the devise or that its value is to be deducted from the value of the devise; or

(3) the devisee acknowledged in writing that the gift is in satisfaction of the devise or that its value is to be deducted from the value of the devise.

(b) For purposes of partial satisfaction, property given during lifetime is valued as of the time the devisee came into possession or enjoyment of the property or at the testator's death, whichever occurs first.

(c) If the devisee fails to survive the testator, the gift is treated as a full or partial satisfaction of the devise, as appropriate, in applying AS 13.12.603 and 13.12.604, unless the testator's contemporaneous writing provides otherwise.

#### Article 8. Rules of Construction Applicable to Wills and Other Governing Instruments.

###### Sec. 13.12.701.   Scope.

In the absence of a finding of a contrary intention, the rules of construction in AS 13.12.701§13.12.711 control the construction of a governing instrument. The rules of construction in AS 13.12.701§13.12.711 apply to a governing instrument of any type, except as the application of a particular section is limited by its terms to a specific type of provision or governing instrument.

###### Sec. 13.12.702.   Requirement of survival by 120 hours.

(a) For the purposes of AS 13.06§AS 13.36, except as provided in (d) of this section, an individual who is not established by clear and convincing evidence to have survived an event, including the death of another individual, by 120 hours is considered to have predeceased the event.

(b) Except as provided in (d) of this section, for purposes of a provision of a governing instrument that relates to an individual surviving an event, including the death of another individual, an individual who is not established by clear and convincing evidence to have survived the event by 120 hours is considered to have predeceased the event.

(c) Except as provided in (d) of this section, if it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that one of two co-owners with right of survivorship survived the other co-owner by 120 hours, one-half of the property passes as if one had survived by 120 hours and one-half as if the other had survived by 120 hours, and if there are more than two co-owners with right of survivorship and it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that at least one of them survived the others by 120 hours, the property passes in the proportion that one bears to the whole number of co-owners. In this subsection, "co-owners with right of survivorship" includes joint tenants, tenants by the entirety, and other co-owners of property or accounts held under circumstances that entitle one or more to the whole of the property or account on the death of the other or others.

(d) Survival by 120 hours is not required if

(1) the governing instrument contains language dealing explicitly with simultaneous deaths or deaths in a common disaster and that language is operable under the facts of the case;

(2) the governing instrument expressly indicates that an individual is not required to survive an event, including the death of another individual, by a specified period or expressly requires the individual to survive the event by a specified period, but survival of the event or the specified period must be established by clear and convincing evidence;

(3) the imposition of a 120-hour requirement of survival would cause a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment to fail to qualify for validity under AS 34.27.051 or 34.27.100 or to become invalid under AS 34.27.051 or 34.27.100, but survival must be established by clear and convincing evidence; or

(4) the application of a 120-hour requirement of survival to multiple governing instruments would result in an unintended failure or duplication of a disposition, but survival must be established by clear and convincing evidence.

(e) A payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument who, under this section, is not entitled to the payment or item of property, or for having taken other action in good faith reliance on the beneficiary's apparent entitlement under the terms of the governing instrument, before the payor or other third party receives written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this section. A payor or other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken after the payor or other third party receives written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this section.

(f) Written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this section shall be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon the payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Upon receipt of written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this section, a payor or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit an item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate, or if proceedings have not been commenced, to or with the court in the judicial district of the decedent's residence. The court shall hold the funds or item of property and, upon the court's determination under this section, shall order disbursement in accordance with the determination. Payments, transfers, or deposits made to or with the court discharge the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.

(g) A person who purchases property for value and without notice, or who receives a payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable obligation, is not obligated under this section to return the payment, item of property, or benefit or liable under this section for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit. But a person who, not for value, receives a payment, item of property, or other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under this section.

(h) If this section or a part of this section is preempted by federal law with respect to a payment, an item of property, or other benefit covered by this section, a person who, not for value, receives the payment, item of property, or benefit to which the person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who would have been entitled to it if this section or part of this section were not preempted.

###### Sec. 13.12.703.   Choice of law as to meaning and effect of governing instrument.

(a) The meaning and legal effect of a governing instrument is determined by the local law of the state selected in the governing instrument, unless the application of that law is contrary to the provisions relating to the elective share described in AS 13.12.201§13.12.214, the provisions relating to exempt property and allowances described in AS 13.12.401§13.12.405, or other public policy of this state otherwise applicable to the disposition.

(b) The provisions of (a) of this section are subject to AS 13.06.068.

###### Sec. 13.12.704.   Power of appointment; meaning of specific reference requirement.

If a governing instrument creating a power of appointment expressly requires that the power be exercised by a reference, an express reference, or a specific reference, to the power or its source, it is presumed that the donor's intention, in requiring that the donee exercise the power by making reference to the particular power or to the creating instrument, was to prevent an inadvertent exercise of the power.

###### Sec. 13.12.705.   Class gifts; terms of relationship.

(a) Adopted individuals and individuals born out of wedlock, and their respective descendants if appropriate to the class, are included in class gifts and other terms of relationship in accordance with the rules for intestate succession. Terms of relationship that do not differentiate relationships by blood from those by affinity, such as "uncles," "aunts," "nieces," or "nephews," are construed to exclude relatives by affinity. Terms of relationship that do not differentiate relationships by the half blood from those by the whole blood, such as "brothers," "sisters," "nieces," or "nephews," are construed to include both types of relationships.

(b) In addition to the requirements of (a) of this section, in construing a dispositive provision of a transferor who is not the natural parent, an individual born to the natural parent is not considered the child of that natural parent unless the individual lived while a minor as a regular member of the household of that natural parent or of that natural parent's parent, brother, sister, spouse, or surviving spouse.

(c) In addition to the requirements of (a) of this section, in construing a dispositive provision of a transferor who is not the adopting parent, an adopted individual is not considered the child of the adopting parent unless the adopted individual lived while a minor, either before or after the adoption, as a regular member of the household of the adopting parent.

###### Sec. 13.12.706.   Life insurance; retirement plan; account with pay on death designation; transfer on death registration; deceased beneficiary.

(a) If a beneficiary fails to survive the decedent and is a grandparent, a descendant of a grandparent, or a stepchild of the decedent, the following apply:

(1) except as provided in (4) of this subsection, if the beneficiary designation is not in the form of a class gift and the deceased beneficiary leaves surviving descendants, a substitute gift is created in the beneficiary's surviving descendants; the beneficiary's surviving descendants take by representation the property to which the beneficiary would have been entitled had the beneficiary survived the decedent;

(2) except as provided in (4) of this subsection, if the beneficiary designation is in the form of a class gift, other than a beneficiary designation to "issue," "descendants," "heirs of the body," "heirs," "next of kin," "relatives," or "family," or a class described by language of similar import, a substitute gift is created in the surviving descendants of a deceased beneficiary; the property to which the beneficiaries would have been entitled had all of them survived the decedent passes to the surviving beneficiaries and the surviving descendants of the deceased beneficiaries; each surviving beneficiary takes the share to which the surviving beneficiary would have been entitled had the deceased beneficiaries survived the decedent; each deceased beneficiary's surviving descendants who are substituted for the deceased beneficiary take by representation the share to which the deceased beneficiary would have been entitled had the deceased beneficiary survived the decedent; in this paragraph, "deceased beneficiary" means a class member who failed to survive the decedent and left one or more surviving descendants;

(3) for the purposes of AS 13.12.701, words of survivorship, as in a beneficiary designation to an individual "if the individual survives me," or in a beneficiary designation to "my surviving children," are not, in the absence of additional evidence, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the application of this section;

(4) if a governing instrument creates an alternative beneficiary designation with respect to a beneficiary designation for which a substitute gift is created by (1) or (2) of this subsection, the substitute gift is superseded by the alternative beneficiary designation only if an expressly designated beneficiary of the alternative beneficiary designation is entitled to take.

(b) If, under (a) of this section, substitute gifts are created and not superseded with respect to more than one beneficiary designation and the beneficiary designations are alternative beneficiary designations, one to the other, the property passes under the primary substitute gift, except that if there is a younger-generation beneficiary designation, the property passes under the younger-generation substitute gift and not under the primary substitute gift. In this subsection,

(1) "primary beneficiary designation" means the beneficiary designation that would have taken effect had all the deceased beneficiaries of the alternative beneficiary designations who left surviving descendants survived the decedent;

(2) "primary substitute gift" means the substitute gift created with respect to the primary beneficiary designation;

(3) "younger-generation beneficiary designation" means a beneficiary designation that

(A) is to a descendant of a beneficiary of the primary beneficiary designation;

(B) is an alternative beneficiary designation with respect to the primary beneficiary designation;

(C) is a beneficiary designation for which a substitute gift is created; and

(D) would have taken effect had all the deceased beneficiaries who left surviving descendants survived the decedent except the deceased beneficiary or beneficiaries of the primary beneficiary designation;

(4) "younger-generation substitute gift" means the substitute gift created with respect to the younger-generation beneficiary designation.

(c) A payor is protected from liability in making payments under the terms of the beneficiary designation until the payor has received written notice of a claim to a substitute gift under this section. Payment made before the receipt of written notice of a claim to a substitute gift under this section discharges the payor, but not the recipient, from all claims for the amounts paid. A payor is liable for a payment made after the payor has received written notice of the claim. A recipient is liable for a payment received, whether or not written notice of the claim is given.

(d) In (c) of this section, the written notice of the claim shall be mailed to the payor's main office or home by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon the payor in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Upon receipt of written notice of the claim, a payor may pay any amount owed by it to the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate or, if proceedings have not been commenced, to the court in the judicial district of the decedent's residence. The court shall hold the funds and, upon its determination under this section, shall order disbursement in accordance with the determination. Payment made to the court discharges the payor from all claims for the amounts paid.

(e) A person who purchases property for value and without notice, or who receives a payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable obligation, is not obligated under this section to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or liable under this section for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit. But a person who, not for value, receives a payment, item of property, or other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under this section.

(f) If this section or a part of this section is preempted by federal law with respect to a payment, an item of property, or other benefit covered by this section, a person who, not for value, receives the payment, item of property, or other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who would have been entitled to it if this section or part of this section were not preempted.

(g) In this section,

(1) "alternative beneficiary designation" means a beneficiary designation that is expressly created by the governing instrument and, under the terms of the governing instrument, can take effect instead of another beneficiary designation on the happening of one or more events, including survival of the decedent or failure to survive the decedent, whether an event is expressed in condition-precedent, condition-subsequent, or another form;

(C) excludes a joint tenant of a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship and a party to a joint and survivorship account;

(3) "beneficiary designation" includes an alternative beneficiary designation and a beneficiary designation in the form of a class gift;

###### Sec. 13.12.707.   Survivorship with respect to future interests under terms of trust; substitute takers.

(a) A future interest under the terms of a trust is contingent on the beneficiary's surviving the distribution date. If a beneficiary of a future interest under the terms of a trust fails to survive the distribution date, the following apply:

(1) except as provided in (4) of this subsection, if the future interest is not in the form of a class gift and the deceased beneficiary leaves surviving descendants, a substitute gift is created in the beneficiary's surviving descendants; the beneficiary's surviving descendants take by representation the property to which the beneficiary would have been entitled had the beneficiary survived the distribution date;

(2) except as provided in (4) of this subsection, if the future interest is in the form of a class gift, other than a future interest to "issue," "descendants," "heirs of the body," "heirs," "next of kin," "relatives," or "family," or a class described by language of similar import, a substitute gift is created in the surviving descendants of a deceased beneficiary; the property to which the beneficiaries would have been entitled had all of them survived the distribution date passes to the surviving beneficiaries and the surviving descendants of the deceased beneficiaries; each surviving beneficiary takes the share to which the surviving beneficiary would have been entitled had the deceased beneficiaries survived the distribution date; each deceased beneficiary's surviving descendants who are substituted for the deceased beneficiary take by representation the share to which the deceased beneficiary would have been entitled had the deceased beneficiary survived the distribution date; in this paragraph, "deceased beneficiary" means a class member who fails to survive the distribution date and leaves one or more surviving descendants;

(3) for the purposes of AS 13.12.701, words of survivorship attached to a future interest are not, in the absence of additional evidence, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the application of this section; words of survivorship include words of survivorship that relate to the distribution date or to an earlier or an unspecified time, whether those words of survivorship are expressed in condition-precedent, condition-subsequent, or another form;

(4) if a governing instrument creates an alternative future interest with respect to a future interest for which a substitute gift is created by (1) or (2) of this subsection, the substitute gift is superseded by the alternative future interest only if an expressly designated beneficiary of the alternative future interest is entitled to take in possession or enjoyment.

(b) If, under (a) of this section, substitute gifts are created and not superseded with respect to more than one future interest and the future interests are alternative future interests, one to the other, the property passes under the primary substitute gift, except that, if there is a younger-generation future interest, the property passes under the younger-generation substitute gift and not under the primary substitute gift. In this subsection,

(1) "primary future interest" means the future interest that would have taken effect had all the deceased beneficiaries of the alternative future interests who left surviving descendants survived the distribution date;

(2) "primary substitute gift" means the substitute gift created with respect to the primary future interest;

(3) "younger-generation future interest" means a future interest that

(A) is to a descendant of a beneficiary of the primary future interest;

(B) is an alternative future interest with respect to the primary future interest;

(C) is a future interest for which a substitute gift is created; and

(D) would have taken effect had all the deceased beneficiaries who left surviving descendants survived the distribution date except the deceased beneficiary of the primary future interest;

(4) "younger-generation substitute gift" means the substitute gift created with respect to the younger-generation future interest.

(c) Except as provided in (d) of this section, if, after the application of (a) and (b) of this section, there is not a surviving taker, the property passes in the following order:

(1) if the trust was created in a nonresiduary devise in the transferor's will or in a codicil to the transferor's will, the property passes under the residuary clause in the transferor's will; for purposes of this section, the residuary clause is treated as creating a future interest under the terms of a trust;

(2) if a taker is not produced by the application of (1) of this subsection, the property passes to the transferor's heirs under AS 13.12.711.

(d) If, after the application of (a) and (b) of this section, there is not a surviving taker and if the future interest was created by the exercise of a power of appointment,

(1) the property passes under the donor's gift-in-default clause, if any, and the clause is treated as creating a future interest under the terms of a trust; and

(2) if a taker is not produced by the application of (1) of this subsection, the property passes as provided in (c) of this section.

(e) In (c) of this section, "transferor" means the donor if the power was a nongeneral power and means the donee if the power was a general power.

(f) In this section,

(1) "alternative future interest" means an expressly created future interest that can take effect in possession or enjoyment instead of another future interest on the happening of one or more events, including survival of an event or failure to survive an event, whether an event is expressed in condition-precedent, condition-subsequent, or other form; a residuary clause in a will does not create an alternative future interest with respect to a future interest created in a nonresiduary devise in the will, whether or not the will specifically provides that lapsed or failed devises are to pass under the residuary clause;

(2) "beneficiary" means the beneficiary of a future interest and includes a class member if the future interest is in the form of a class gift;

(3) "class member" includes an individual who fails to survive the distribution date but who would have taken under a future interest in the form of a class gift had the individual survived the distribution date;

(4) "distribution date," with respect to a future interest, means the time when the future interest is to take effect in possession or enjoyment; the distribution date does not need to occur at the beginning or end of a calendar day, but can occur at a time during the course of a day;

(5) "future interest" includes an alternative future interest and a future interest in the form of a class gift;

(6) "future interest under the terms of a trust" means a future interest that was created by a transfer creating a trust or to an existing trust or by an exercise of a power of appointment to an existing trust, directing the continuance of an existing trust, designating a beneficiary of an existing trust, or creating a trust;

(7) "surviving beneficiary" or "surviving descendant" means a beneficiary or a descendant who neither predeceased the distribution date nor is considered to have predeceased the distribution date under AS 13.12.702.

###### Sec. 13.12.708.   Class gifts to "descendants," "issue," or "heirs of the body"; form of distribution if none specified.

If a class gift in favor of "descendants," "issue," or "heirs of the body" does not specify the manner in which the property is to be distributed among the class members, the property is distributed among the class members who are living when the interest is to take effect in possession or enjoyment, in such shares as they would receive, under the applicable law of intestate succession, if the designated ancestor had then died intestate owning the subject matter of the class gift.

###### Sec. 13.12.709.   Distribution by representation, per capita at each generation, and per stirpes.

(a) If an applicable statute or a governing instrument calls for property to be distributed "by representation" or "per capita at each generation," the property is divided into as many equal shares as there are

(1) surviving descendants in the generation nearest to the designated ancestor that contains one or more surviving descendants; and

(2) deceased descendants in the same generation who left surviving descendants, if any.

(b) In (a) of this section, each surviving descendant in the nearest generation is allocated one share, and the remaining shares, if any, are combined and then divided in the same manner among the surviving descendants of the deceased descendants as if the surviving descendants who were allocated a share and their surviving descendants had predeceased the distribution date.

(c) If a governing instrument calls for property to be distributed "per stirpes," the property is divided into as many equal shares as there are

(1) surviving children of the designated ancestor; and

(2) deceased children who left surviving descendants.

(d) In (c) of this section, each surviving child, if any, is allocated one share, and the share of each deceased child with surviving descendants is divided in the same manner, with subdivision repeating at each succeeding generation until the property is fully allocated among surviving descendants.

(e) For the purposes of (a)§(d) of this section, an individual who is deceased and does not leave surviving descendants is disregarded, and an individual who leaves a surviving ancestor who is a descendant of the designated ancestor is not entitled to a share.

(f) In this section,

(1) "deceased child" or "deceased descendant" means a child or a descendant who either predeceased the distribution date or is considered to have predeceased the distribution date under AS 13.12.702;

(2) "distribution date," with respect to an interest, means the time when the interest is to take effect in possession or enjoyment; the distribution date does not need to occur at the beginning or end of a calendar day, but can occur at a time during the course of a day;

(3) "surviving ancestor," "surviving child," or "surviving descendant" means an ancestor, a child, or a descendant who neither predeceased the distribution date nor is considered to have predeceased the distribution date under AS 13.12.702.

###### Sec. 13.12.710.   Worthier-title doctrine abolished.

The doctrine of worthier title is abolished as a rule of law and as a rule of construction. Language in a governing instrument describing the beneficiaries of a disposition as the transferor's "heirs," "heirs at law," "next of kin," "distributees," "relatives," or "family," or language of similar import, does not create or presumptively create a reversionary interest in the transferor.

###### Sec. 13.12.711.   Interests in heirs and other persons.

If an applicable statute or a governing instrument calls for a present or future distribution to or creates a present or future interest in a designated individual's "heirs," "heirs at law," "next of kin," "relatives," or "family," or language of similar import, the property passes to those persons, including the state, and in such shares as would succeed to the designated individual's intestate estate under the intestate succession law of the designated individual's domicile if the designated individual died when the disposition is to take effect in possession or enjoyment. If the designated individual's surviving spouse is living but is remarried at the time the disposition is to take effect in possession or enjoyment, the surviving spouse is not an heir of the designated individual.

###### Sec. 13.12.712.   Nonademption of specific transfers in trust.

(a) Unless the trust provides otherwise, a beneficiary of a trust has a right to property that, by the terms of the trust, is to be specifically distributed to the beneficiary and to

(1) any amount of a condemnation award that is for the taking of the property and that is unpaid when the distribution becomes effective;

(2) any proceeds from fire or casualty insurance on, or other recovery for injury to, the property that are unpaid when the distribution becomes effective; and

(3) property owned by the settlor when the distribution becomes effective if the property is acquired as a result of foreclosure, or obtained in lieu of foreclosure, of the security interest for the specifically distributed obligation.

(b) Unless the covered trust provides otherwise, if property that is to be specifically distributed to a beneficiary of a covered trust is instead sold or mortgaged by a trustee of the covered trust, or if a condemnation award, insurance proceeds, or a recovery for injury to the property is paid to a trustee of the covered trust, the beneficiary has the right to a general pecuniary property distribution that is equal to the net sale price, the amount of the unpaid loan, the condemnation award, the insurance proceeds, or the recovery. In this subsection, "covered trust," means a trust that was originally amendable or revocable by the settlor but that cannot be amended or revoked by the settlor because of the settlor's incapacity.

(c) The right of a beneficiary under (b) of this section is reduced by any right the beneficiary has under (a) of this section.

(d)  [Repealed,§3 ch 36 SLA 2001.]

(e)  [Repealed,§3 ch 36 SLA 2001.]

###### Sec. 13.12.720.   Family-owned business deduction.

(a) If an individual includes a provision in a will, trust document, or beneficiary designation that is designed to reduce federal estate tax liability to zero, or to the lowest possible amount payable, by describing a portion or amount measured by reference to the unified credit, applicable exclusion amount, or exemption equivalent under 26 U.S.C. 2010 (Internal Revenue Code), or to other credits or deductions under 26 U.S.C. (Internal Revenue Code), then unless specifically stated otherwise, the reference to the unified credit, applicable exclusion amount, exemption equivalent, other credit, or other deduction shall be considered to include a reference to the family-owned business deduction available and allowed under 26 U.S.C. 2057 (Internal Revenue Code).

(b) Unless specifically stated otherwise, the reference in the will, trust document, or beneficiary designation to the unified credit, applicable exclusion amount, exemption equivalent, family-owned business deduction, other credit, or other deduction shall be considered to refer to the unified credit, applicable exclusion amount, exemption equivalent, family-owned business deduction, other credit, or other deduction as it exists at the time of death of the individual.

#### Article 9. General Provisions Concerning Probate and Nonprobate Transfers.

###### Sec. 13.12.801.   Disclaimer of property interests. [Repealed,§2 ch 63 SLA 2010.]

###### Sec. 13.12.802.   Effect of divorce, annulment, and decree of separation.

(a) An individual who is divorced from the decedent or whose marriage to the decedent has been annulled is not a surviving spouse unless, by virtue of a subsequent marriage, the individual is married to the decedent at the time of death. A decree of separation that does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section.

(b) In AS 13.12.101§13.12.405 and AS 13.16.065, a surviving spouse does not include

(1) an individual who obtains or consents to a final decree or judgment of divorce from the decedent or an annulment of their marriage, if the decree or judgment is not recognized as valid in this state, unless subsequently they participate in a marriage ceremony purporting to marry each to the other or live together as husband and wife;

(2) an individual who, following an invalid decree or judgment of divorce or annulment obtained by the decedent, participates in a marriage ceremony with a third individual; or

(3) an individual who was a party to a valid proceeding concluded by an order purporting to terminate all marital property rights.

###### Sec. 13.12.803.   Effect of homicide on intestate succession, wills, trusts, joint assets, life insurance, and beneficiary designations.

(a) An individual who feloniously kills the decedent forfeits all benefits under this chapter with respect to the decedent's estate, including an intestate share, an elective share, an omitted spouse's or child's share, a homestead allowance, exempt property, and a family allowance. If the decedent died intestate, the decedent's intestate estate passes as if the killer disclaimed the killer's intestate share.

(b) The felonious killing of the decedent

(1) revokes a revocable

(A) disposition or appointment of property made by the decedent to the killer in a governing instrument;

(B) provision in a governing instrument conferring a general or nongeneral power of appointment on the killer; and

(C) nomination of the killer in a governing instrument, nominating or appointing the killer to serve in fiduciary or representative capacity, including a personal representative, executor, trustee, or agent; and

(2) severs the interests of the decedent and killer in property held by them at the time of the killing as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, transforming the interests of the decedent and killer into tenancies in common.

(c) A severance under (b)(2) of this section does not affect a third-party interest in property acquired for value and in good faith reliance on an apparent title by survivorship in the killer unless a writing declaring the severance has been noted, registered, filed, or recorded in records that are appropriate to the kind and location of the property and that are relied upon, in the ordinary course of transactions involving the type of property, as evidence of ownership.

(d) Provisions of a governing instrument are given effect as if the killer disclaimed all provisions revoked by this section or, in the case of a revoked nomination in a fiduciary or representative capacity, as if the killer predeceased the decedent.

(e) A wrongful acquisition of property or interest by a killer not covered by this section shall be treated in accordance with the principle that a killer may not profit from the killer's wrong.

(f) After all right to appeal has been exhausted, a judgment of conviction establishing criminal accountability for the felonious killing of the decedent conclusively establishes the convicted individual as the decedent's killer for purposes of this section. In the absence of a conviction, the court, upon the petition of an interested person, shall determine whether, under the preponderance of evidence standard, the individual would be found criminally accountable for the felonious killing of the decedent. If the court determines that, under that standard, the individual would be found criminally accountable for the felonious killing of the decedent, the determination conclusively establishes that individual as the decedent's killer for purposes of this section.

(g) A payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument affected by a felonious killing, or for having taken other action in good faith reliance on the validity of the governing instrument, upon request and satisfactory proof of the decedent's death, before the payor or other third party received written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section. A payor or other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken after the payor or other third party receives written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section.

(h) Written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under (g) of this section shall be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon the payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Upon receipt of written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section, a payor or other third party may pay an amount owed or transfer or deposit an item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate, or if proceedings have not been commenced, to or with the court in the judicial district of the decedent's residence. The court shall hold the funds or item of property and, upon the court's determination under this section, shall order disbursement in accordance with the determination. Payments, transfers, or deposits made to or with the court discharge the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.

(i) A person who purchases property for value and without notice, or who receives a payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable obligation, is not obligated under this section to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or liable under this section for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit. However a person who, not for value, receives a payment, an item of property, or other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under this section.

(j) If this section or part of this section is preempted by federal law with respect to a payment, an item of property, or other benefit covered by this section, a person who, not for value, receives the payment, item of property, or other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who would have been entitled to it if this section or part of this section were not preempted.

(k) In the case of an unintentional felonious killing, a court may set aside the application of (a), (b), (d), or (e) of this section if the court makes special findings of fact and conclusions of law that the application of the subsection would result in a manifest injustice and that the subsection should not be applied.

(l) In this section,

(1) "disposition or appointment of property" includes a transfer of an item of property or other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument;

(2) "governing instrument" means a governing instrument executed by the decedent;

(3) "revocable," with respect to a disposition, appointment, provision, or nomination, means a disposition, appointment, provision, or nomination under which the decedent, at the time of or immediately before death, was alone empowered, by law or under the governing instrument, to cancel the designation in favor of the killer, whether or not the decedent was then empowered to designate the decedent in place of the decedent's killer or the decedent then had capacity to exercise the power.

###### Sec. 13.12.804.   Effect of divorce, annulment, and other changes of circumstances on probate and nonprobate transfers.

(a) Except as provided by the express terms of a governing instrument, a court order, or a contract relating to the division of the marital estate made between the divorced individuals before or after the marriage, divorce, or annulment, the divorce or annulment of a marriage

(1) revokes a revocable

(A) disposition or appointment of property made by a divorced individual to the divorced individual's former spouse in a governing instrument and a disposition or appointment created by law or in a governing instrument to a relative of the divorced individual's former spouse;

(B) provision in a governing instrument conferring a general or nongeneral power of appointment on the divorced individual's former spouse or on a relative of the divorced individual's former spouse; and

(C) nomination in a governing instrument, nominating a divorced individual's former spouse or a relative of the divorced individual's former spouse to serve in a fiduciary or representative capacity, including a personal representative, executor, trustee, conservator, agent, or guardian; and

(2) severs the interests of the former spouses in property held by them at the time of the divorce or annulment as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, transforming the interests of the former spouses into tenancies in common.

(b) A severance under (a)(2) of this section does not affect a third-party interest in property acquired for value and in good faith reliance on an apparent title by survivorship in the survivor of the former spouses unless a writing declaring the severance has been noted, registered, filed, or recorded in records appropriate to the kind and location of the property that are relied upon, in the ordinary course of transactions involving that kind of property, as evidence of ownership.

(c) Provisions of a governing instrument are given effect as if the former spouse and relatives of the former spouse disclaimed all provisions revoked by this section or, in the case of a revoked nomination in a fiduciary or representative capacity, as if the former spouse and relatives of the former spouse died immediately before the divorce or annulment.

(d) Provisions revoked solely by this section are revived by the divorced individual's remarriage to the former spouse or by a nullification of the divorce or annulment.

(e) A change of circumstances other than as described in this section and in AS 13.12.803 does not effect a revocation.

(f) A payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument affected by a divorce, annulment, or remarriage, or for having taken other action in good faith reliance on the validity of the governing instrument, before the payor or other third party received written notice of the divorce, annulment, or remarriage. A payor or other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken after the payor or other third party receives written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section.

(g) Written notice of the divorce, annulment, or remarriage under (f) of this section shall be mailed to the payor's or other third-party's main office or home by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon the payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Upon receipt of written notice of the divorce, annulment, or remarriage, a payor or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate or, if proceedings have not been commenced, to or with the court located in the judicial district of the decedent's residence. The court shall hold the funds or item of property and, upon its determination under this section, shall order disbursement or transfer in accordance with the determination. Payments, transfers, or deposits made to or with the court discharge the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.

(h) A person who purchases property from a former spouse, relative of a former spouse, or another person for value and without notice, or who receives from a former spouse, relative of a former spouse, or another person a payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable obligation, is not obligated under this section to return the payment, an item of property, or benefit, or liable under this section for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit. However, a former spouse, relative of a former spouse, or other person who, not for value, receives a payment, an item of property, or other benefit to which that person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return the payment, an item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under this section.

(i) If this section or a part of this section is preempted by federal law with respect to a payment, an item of property, or other benefit covered by this section, a former spouse, relative of the former spouse, or another person who, not for value, received a payment, an item of property, or other benefit to which that person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return that payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who would have been entitled to it if this section or part of this section were not preempted.

(j) In this section,

(1) "disposition or appointment of property" includes a transfer of an item of property or other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument;

(2) "divorce or annulment" means any divorce or annulment, or any dissolution or declaration of invalidity of a marriage, that would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of AS 13.12.802; a decree of separation that does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section;

(3) "divorced individual" includes an individual whose marriage has been annulled;

(4) "governing instrument" means a governing instrument executed by the divorced individual before the divorce or annulment of the divorced individual's marriage to the divorced individual's former spouse;

#### Article 10. Miscellaneous Provisions.

###### Sec. 13.12.907.   Honorary trusts; trusts for pets.

(a) Subject to (c) of this section, a trust may be performed by the trustee for 21 years but not longer, whether or not the terms of the trust contemplate a longer duration, if

Extrinsic evidence is admissible in determining the transferor's intent.

(c) In addition to the provisions of (a) or (b) of this section, a trust covered by either of those subsections is subject to the following provisions:

(3) for the purposes of AS 13.12.707, the residuary clause is treated as creating a future interest under the terms of a trust;

(4) the intended use of the principal or income may be enforced by an individual designated for that purpose in the trust instrument or, if none, by an individual appointed by a court upon application to the court by an individual;

(5) except as ordered by the court or required by the trust instrument, a filing, report, registration, periodic accounting, separate maintenance of funds, appointment, or fee is not required by reason of the existence of the fiduciary relationship of the trustee;

The testator does not need to inform the witnesses, or the authorized person, of the contents of the will.

(c) In the presence of the witnesses, and of the authorized person, the testator shall sign the international will, or, if the testator has previously signed it, shall acknowledge the testator's signature.

(d) When the testator is unable to sign, the absence of the testator's signature does not affect the validity of the international will if the testator indicates the reason for the testator's inability to sign and the authorized person makes note of the reason on the will. In these cases, it is permissible for any other person present, including the authorized person or one of the witnesses, at the direction of the testator, to sign the testator's name for the testator, if the authorized person makes note of this also on the will, but it is not required that a person sign the testator's name for the testator.

(e) The witnesses and the authorized person shall there and then attest the international will by signing in the presence of the testator.

###### Sec. 13.12.914.   International will; other points of form.

(a) The signatures shall be placed at the end of the international will. If the will consists of several sheets, each sheet shall be signed by the testator or, if the testator is unable to sign, by the person signing on the testator's behalf or, if a person is not signing on the testator's behalf, by the authorized person. In addition, each sheet shall be numbered.

(b) The date of the international will is the date of its signature by the authorized person. That date shall be noted at the end of the will by the authorized person.

(c) The authorized person shall ask the testator whether the testator wishes to make a declaration concerning the safekeeping of the will. If so and at the express request of the testator the place where the testator intends to have the will kept shall be mentioned in the certificate provided for in AS 13.12.915.

(d) An international will executed in compliance with AS 13.12.913 is not invalid merely because it does not comply with this section.

###### Sec. 13.12.915.   International will; certificate.

The authorized person shall attach to the international will a certificate to be signed by the authorized person establishing that the requirements of  AS 13.12.912§ 13.12.921 for valid execution of an international will have been complied with. The authorized person shall keep a copy of the certificate and deliver another to the testator. The certificate shall be substantially in the following form:

###### Sec. 13.12.916.   International will; effect of certificate.

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the certificate of the authorized person is conclusive of the formal validity of the instrument as an international will under AS 13.12.912§13.12.921. The absence or irregularity of a certificate does not affect the formal validity of a will under AS 13.12.912§13.12.921.

###### Sec. 13.12.917.   International will; revocation.

An international will is subject to the ordinary rules of revocation of wills.

###### Sec. 13.12.918.   Source and construction.

AS 13.12.912§13.12.917 and 13.12.921 derive from the Annex to Convention of October 26, 1973, Providing a Uniform Law on the Form of an International Will.

###### Sec. 13.12.920.   International will information registration.

The Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development shall establish a registry system by which authorized persons may register in a central information center information regarding the execution of international wills, keeping that information in strictest confidence until the death of the maker and then making it available to any person desiring information about any will who presents a death certificate or other satisfactory evidence of the testator's death to the center. Information that may be received, preserved in confidence until death, and reported as indicated is limited to the testator's name, social security, or other individual identifying number established by law, address, and date and place of birth, and the intended place of deposit or safekeeping of the instrument pending the death of the maker. The Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development, at the request of the authorized person, may cause the information it receives about execution of an international will to be transmitted to the registry system of another jurisdiction as identified by the testator, if that other system adheres to rules protecting the confidentiality of the information similar to those established in this state.

###### Sec. 13.12.921.   Definitions for AS 13.12.912§13.12.921.

In AS 13.12.912§13.12.921,

#### Article 1. General Provisions.

## Chapter 16. Probate of Wills and Administration.

###### Sec. 13.16.005.   Devolution of estate at death; restrictions.

The power of a person to leave property by will, and the rights of creditors, devisees, and heirs to the property are subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in AS 13.06§ AS 13.36 to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates. Upon the death of a person, that person's real and personal property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by the last will or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving lapse, renunciation, or other circumstances affecting the devolution of testate estates, or in the absence of testamentary disposition, to the heirs, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving renunciation or other circumstances affecting devolution of intestate estates, subject to homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance, to rights of creditors, elective share of the surviving spouse, and to administration.

###### Sec. 13.16.010.   Necessity of order of probate for will.

Except as provided in AS 13.16.680, to be effective to prove the transfer of property or to nominate an executor, a will must be declared to be valid by an order of informal probate by the registrar or by an adjudication of probate by the court.

###### Sec. 13.16.015.   Necessity of appointment for administration.

Except as otherwise provided in AS 13.21, to acquire the powers and undertake the duties and liabilities of a personal representative of a decedent, a person must be appointed by order of the court or registrar, qualify, and be issued letters. Administration of an estate is commenced by the issuance of letters.

###### Sec. 13.16.020.   Claims against decedent; necessity of administration.

A proceeding to enforce a claim against the estate of a decedent or the decedent's successors may not be revived or commenced before the appointment of a personal representative.  After the appointment and until distribution, all proceedings and actions to enforce a claim against the estate are governed by the procedure prescribed by this chapter.  After distribution a creditor whose claim has not been barred may recover from the distributees as provided in AS 13.16.635 or from a former personal representative individually liable as provided in AS 13.16.640.  This section has no application to a proceeding by a secured creditor of the decedent to enforce a right to the security except as to any deficiency judgment that might be sought in the proceeding.

###### Sec. 13.16.025.   Proceedings affecting devolution and administration; jurisdiction of subject matter.

Persons interested in decedents' estates may apply to the registrar for determination in the informal proceedings provided in this chapter, and may petition the court for orders in formal proceedings within the court's jurisdiction including those described in this chapter. The court has exclusive jurisdiction of formal proceedings to determine how decedents' estates subject to the laws of this state are to be administered, expended, and distributed. The court has concurrent jurisdiction of any other action or proceeding concerning a succession or to which an estate, through a personal representative, may be a party, including actions to determine title to property alleged to belong to the estate, and of any action or proceeding in which property distributed by a personal representative or its value is sought to be subjected to rights of creditors or successors of the decedent.

###### Sec. 13.16.030.   Proceedings within the exclusive jurisdiction of court; service; jurisdiction over persons.

In proceedings within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court where notice is required by AS 13.06 § AS 13.36 or by rule, and in proceedings to construe probated wills or determine heirs which proceedings concern estates that have not been and cannot at the time of these proceedings be opened for administration, interested persons may be bound by the orders of the court in respect to property in or subject to the laws of this state by notice in conformity with AS 13.06.110.  An order is binding as to all who are given notice of the proceeding though fewer than all interested persons are notified.

###### Sec. 13.16.035.   Scope of proceedings; proceedings independent; exception.

Unless supervised administration as described in AS 13.16.215§ 13.16.235 is involved,

(1) each proceeding before the court or registrar is independent of any other proceeding involving the same estate;

(2) petitions for formal orders of the court may combine various requests for relief in a single proceeding if the orders sought may be finally granted without delay; except as required for proceedings that are particularly described by other sections of this chapter, no petition is defective because it fails to embrace all matters that might then be the subject of a final order;

(3) proceedings for probate of wills or adjudications of no will may be combined with proceedings for appointment of personal representatives; and

(4) a proceeding for appointment of a personal representative is concluded by an order making or declining the appointment.

###### Sec. 13.16.040.   Probate, testacy, and appointment proceedings; ultimate time limit.

(a) An informal probate or appointment proceeding or formal testacy or appointment proceeding, other than a proceeding to probate a will previously probated at the testator's domicile and appointment proceedings relating to an estate in which there has been a prior appointment, may not be commenced more than three years after the decedent's death, except

(1) if a previous proceeding was dismissed because of doubt about the fact of the decedent's death, appropriate probate, appointment, or testacy proceedings may be maintained at any time after the dismissal upon a finding that the decedent's death occurred before the initiation of the previous proceeding and the applicant or petitioner has not delayed unduly in initiating the subsequent proceeding;

(2) appropriate probate, appointment, or testacy proceedings may be maintained in relation to the estate of an absent, disappeared, or missing person for whose estate a conservator has been appointed, at any time within three years after the conservator becomes able to establish the death of the protected person;

(3) a proceeding to contest an informally probated will and to secure appointment of the person with legal priority for appointment in the event the contest is successful, may be commenced within the later of 12 months from the informal probate or three years from the decedent's death;

(4) an informal appointment or a formal testacy or appointment proceeding may be commenced after the three years if proceedings concerning the succession or estate administration have not occurred within the three-year period after the decedent's death, but the personal representative may not possess estate assets as provided in AS 13.16.380 beyond that necessary to confirm title to the assets in the successors to the estate and claims other than expenses of administration may not be presented against the estate; and

(5) a formal testacy proceeding may be commenced at any time after three years from the decedent's death for the purpose of establishing an instrument to direct or control the ownership of property passing or distributable after the decedent's death from a person other than the decedent when the property is to be appointed by the terms of the decedent's will or is to pass or be distributed as a part of the decedent's estate or its transfer is otherwise to be controlled by the terms of the decedent's will.

(b) The limitations in (a) of this section do not apply to proceedings to construe probated wills or determine heirs of an intestate.

(c) In cases under (a)(1) or (2) of this section, the date on which a testacy or appointment proceeding is properly commenced is considered to be the date of the decedent's death for purposes of other limitations provisions of AS 13.06§AS 13.36 that relate to the date of death.

###### Sec. 13.16.045.   Statutes of limitation on decedent's cause of action.

No statute of limitation running on a cause of action belonging to a decedent that had not been barred as of the date of death shall apply to bar a cause of action surviving the decedent's death sooner than four months after death.  A cause of action that, but for this section, would have been barred less than four months after death, is barred after four months unless tolled.

#### Article 2. Venue for Probate and Administration; Priority to Administer; Demand for Notice.

###### Sec. 13.16.055.   Venue for first and subsequent estate proceedings; location of property.

(a) Venue for the first informal or formal testacy or appointment proceedings after a decedent's death is

(1) in the judicial district where the decedent was domiciled at the time of death; or

(2) if the decedent was not domiciled in this state, in any judicial district where

(A) property of the decedent was located at the time of death; or

(B) a fiduciary who is subject to the laws of this state and who comes into the control of property owned by the decedent at the time of death resides or has its principal place of business.

(b) Venue for all subsequent proceedings within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court is in the place where the initial proceeding occurred, unless the initial proceeding has been transferred as provided in AS 13.06.070 or (c) of this section.

(c) If the first proceeding was informal, on application of an interested person and after notice to the proponent in the first proceeding, the court, upon finding that venue is elsewhere, may transfer the proceeding and the file to the other court.

(d) For the purpose of aiding determinations concerning location of assets that may be relevant in cases involving nondomiciliaries, a debt, other than one evidenced by investment or commercial paper or other instrument in favor of a nondomiciliary, is located where the debtor resides or, if the debtor is a person other than an individual, at the place where it has its principal office.  Commercial paper, investment paper, and other instruments are located where the instrument is.  An interest in property held in trust is located where the trustee may be sued.

###### Sec. 13.16.060.   Appointment or testacy proceedings; conflicting claim of domicile in another state.

If conflicting claims as to the domicile of a decedent are made in a formal testacy or appointment proceeding commenced in this state, and in a testacy or appointment proceeding after notice pending at the same time in another state, the court of this state must stay, dismiss, or permit suitable amendment in, the proceeding here unless it is determined that the local proceeding was commenced before the proceeding elsewhere.  The determination of domicile in the proceeding first commenced must be accepted as determinative in the proceeding of this state.

###### Sec. 13.16.065.   Priority among persons seeking appointment as personal representative.

(a) Whether the proceedings are formal or informal, persons who are not disqualified have priority for appointment in the following order:

(1) the person with priority as determined by a probated will, including a person nominated by a power conferred in a will;

(2) the surviving spouse of the decedent who is a devisee of the decedent;

(3) other devisees of the decedent;

(4) the surviving spouse of the decedent;

(5) other heirs of the decedent;

(6) 45 days after the death of the decedent, any creditor.

(b) An objection to an appointment can be made only in formal proceedings.  In case of objection the priorities stated in (a) of this section apply except that

(1) if the estate appears to be more than adequate to meet exemptions and costs of administration but inadequate to discharge anticipated unsecured claims, the court, on petition of creditors, may appoint any qualified person;

(2) in case of objection to appointment of a person other than one whose priority is determined by will by an heir or devisee appearing to have a substantial interest in the estate, the court may appoint a person who is acceptable to heirs and devisees whose interests in the estate appear to be worth in total more than half of the probable distributable value, or, in default of this accord, any suitable person.

(c) A person entitled to letters under (a)(2)§(5) of this section, and a person aged 18 and over who would be entitled to letters but for the person's age, may nominate a qualified person to act as personal representative.  Any person aged 18 and over may renounce the right to nominate or to an appointment by appropriate writing filed with the court.  When two or more persons share a priority, those of them who do not renounce must concur in nominating another to act for them, or in applying for appointment.

(d) Conservators of the estates of protected persons, or if there is no conservator, any guardian except a guardian ad litem of a minor or incapacitated person, may exercise the same right to nominate, to object to another's appointment, or to participate in determining the preference of a majority in interest of the heirs and devisees that the protected person or ward would have if qualified for appointment.

(e) Appointment of one who does not have priority, including priority resulting from renunciation or nomination determined under this section, may be made only in formal proceedings. Before appointing one without priority, the court must determine that those having priority, although given notice of the proceedings, have failed to request appointment or to nominate another for appointment, and that administration is necessary.

(f) No person is qualified to serve as a personal representative who is

(1) under the age of 19;

(2) a person whom the court finds unsuitable in formal proceedings.

(g) A personal representative appointed by a court of the decedent's domicile has priority over all other persons except where the decedent's will nominates different persons to be personal representative in this state and in the state of domicile.  The domiciliary personal representative may nominate another, who shall have the same priority as the domiciliary personal representative.

(h) This section governs priority for appointment of a successor personal representative but does not apply to the selection of a special administrator.

###### Sec. 13.16.070.   Demand for notice of order or filing concerning decedent's estate.

Any person desiring notice of any order or filing pertaining to a decedent's estate in which the person has a financial or property interest, may file a demand for notice with the court at any time after the death of the decedent stating the name of the decedent, the nature of the demandant's interest in the estate, and the demandant's address or that of the demandant's attorney.  The clerk shall mail a copy of the demand to the personal representative if one has been appointed. After filing of a demand, no order or filing to which the demand relates shall be made or accepted without notice as prescribed in AS 13.06.110 to the demandant or the demandant's attorney. The validity of an order that is issued or a filing that is accepted without compliance with this requirement is not affected by the error, but the petitioner receiving the order or the person making the filing may be liable for any damage caused by the absence of notice.  The requirement of notice arising from a demand under this provision may be waived in writing by the demandant and shall cease upon the termination of the demandant's interest in the estate.

#### Article 3. Informal Probate and Appointment Proceedings.

###### Sec. 13.16.080.   Informal probate or appointment proceedings; application; contents.

(a) Applications for informal probate or informal appointment shall be directed to the registrar, and verified by the applicant to be accurate and complete to the best of the applicant's knowledge and belief as to the following information:

(F) a statement that the time limit for informal probate as provided in AS 13.16.080 § 13.16.130 has not expired either because three years or less have passed since the decedent's death, or, if more than three years from death have passed, that circumstances as described by AS 13.16.040 authorizing tardy probate or appointment have occurred;

(2) an application for informal probate of a will must state the following in addition to the statements required by (1) of this subsection:

(B) the priority of the person whose appointment is sought and the names of any other persons having a prior or equal right to the appointment under AS 13.16.065;

(5) an application for appointment of a personal representative to succeed a personal representative appointed under a different testacy status must refer to the order in the most recent testacy proceeding, state the name and address of the person whose appointment is sought and of the person whose appointment will be terminated if the application is granted, and describe the priority of the applicant;

(b) By verifying an application for informal probate or informal appointment, the applicant submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding for relief from fraud relating to the application, or for perjury, that may be instituted against the applicant.

###### Sec. 13.16.085.   Informal probate; duty of registrar; effect of informal probate.

Upon receipt of an application requesting informal probate of a will, the registrar, upon making the findings required by AS 13.16.090, shall issue a written statement of informal probate if at least 120 hours have elapsed since the decedent's death.  Informal probate is conclusive as to all persons until superseded by an order in a formal testacy proceeding.  No defect in the application or procedure relating to it that leads to informal probate of a will renders the probate void.

###### Sec. 13.16.090.   Informal probate; proof and findings required.

(a) In an informal proceeding for original probate of a will, the registrar shall determine whether

(1) the application is complete;

(2) the applicant has made oath or affirmation that the statements contained in the application are true to the best of the applicant's knowledge and belief;

(3) the applicant appears from the application to be an interested person as defined in AS 13.06.050;

(4) on the basis of the statements in the application, venue is proper;

(5) an original, duly executed and apparently unrevoked will is in the registrar's possession;

(6) any notice required by AS 13.16.070 has been given and that the application is not within AS 13.16.095; and

(7) it appears from the application that the time limit for original probate has not expired.

(b) The application shall be denied if it indicates that a personal representative has been appointed in another judicial district of this state or, except as provided in (d) of this section, if it appears that this or another will of the decedent has been the subject of a previous probate order.

(c) A will that appears to have the required signatures and that contains an attestation clause showing that requirements of execution under AS 13.12.502 or 13.12.506 have been met shall be probated without further proof. In other cases, the registrar may assume execution if the will appears to have been properly executed, or the registrar may accept a sworn statement or affidavit of a person having knowledge of the circumstances of execution, whether or not the person was a witness to the will.

(d) Informal probate of a will that has been previously probated elsewhere may be granted at any time upon written application by any interested person, together with deposit of an authenticated copy of the will and of the statement probating it from the office or court where it was first probated.

(e) A will from a place that does not provide for probate of a will after death and that is not eligible for probate under (a) of this section, may be probated in this state upon receipt by the registrar of a duly authenticated copy of the will and a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian that the copy filed is a true copy and that the will has become operative under the law of the other place.

###### Sec. 13.16.095.   Informal probate; unavailable in certain cases.

Applications for informal probate that relate to one or more of a known series of testamentary instruments, other than wills and codicils, the latest of which does not expressly revoke the earlier, shall be declined.

###### Sec. 13.16.100.   Informal probate; registrar not satisfied.

If the registrar is not satisfied that a will is entitled to be probated in informal proceedings because of failure to meet the requirements of AS 13.16.090 and 13.16.095 or any other reason, the registrar may decline the application.  A declination of informal probate is not an adjudication and does not preclude formal probate proceedings.

###### Sec. 13.16.105.   Informal probate; notice requirements; information distribution.

(a) The moving party must give notice as described by AS 13.06.110 of the party's application for informal probate (1) to any person demanding it under AS 13.16.070, and (2) to any personal representative of the decedent whose appointment has not been terminated.  No other notice of informal probate is required.

(b) If an informal probate is granted, within 30 days the applicant shall give written information of the probate to the heirs and devisees.  The information shall include the name and address of the applicant, the name and location of the court granting the informal probate, and the date of the probate.  The information shall be delivered or sent by ordinary mail to each of the heirs and devisees whose address is reasonably available to the applicant.  No duty to give information is incurred if a personal representative is appointed who is required to give the written information required by AS 13.16.360.  An applicant's failure to give information as required by this section is a breach of a duty to the heirs and devisees but does not affect the validity of the probate.

###### Sec. 13.16.110.   Informal appointment proceedings; delay in order; duty of registrar; effect of appointment.

(a) Upon receipt of an application for informal appointment of a personal representative other than a special administrator as provided in AS 13.16.310, if at least 120 hours have elapsed since the decedent's death, the registrar, after making the findings required by AS 13.16.115, shall appoint the applicant subject to qualification and acceptance; however, if the decedent was a nonresident, the registrar shall delay the order of appointment until 30 days have elapsed since death unless the personal representative appointed at the decedent's domicile is the applicant, or unless the decedent's will directs that the estate be subject to the laws of this state.

(b) The status of personal representative and the powers and duties pertaining to the office are fully established by informal appointment.  An appointment, and the office of personal representative created thereby, is subject to termination as provided in AS 13.16.280 §13.16.300, but is not subject to retroactive vacation.

###### Sec. 13.16.115.   Informal appointment proceedings; determinations required; denial of application.

(a) In informal appointment proceedings, the registrar must determine whether

(1) the application for informal appointment of a personal representative is complete;

(2) the applicant has made oath or affirmation that the statements contained in the application are true to the best of the applicant's knowledge and belief;

(3) the applicant appears from the application to be an interested person as defined in AS 13.06.050;

(4) on the basis of the statements in the application, venue is proper;

(5) any will to which the requested appointment relates has been formally or informally probated; but this requirement does not apply to the appointment of a special administrator;

(6) any notice required by AS 13.16.070 has been given;

(7) from the statements in the application, the person whose appointment is sought has priority entitling the person to the appointment.

(b) Unless AS 13.16.300 controls, the application must be denied if it indicates that a personal representative who has not filed a written statement of resignation as provided in AS 13.16.290(c) has been appointed in a judicial district of this state, that, unless the applicant is the domiciliary personal representative or the personal representative's nominee, the decedent was not domiciled in this state and that a personal representative whose appointment has not been terminated has been appointed by a court in the state of domicile, or that other requirements of this section have not been met.

###### Sec. 13.16.120.   Informal appointment proceedings; registrar not satisfied.

If the registrar is not satisfied that a requested informal appointment of a personal representative should be made because of failure to meet the requirements of AS 13.16.110 and 13.16.115, or for any other reason, the registrar may decline the application.  A declination of informal appointment is not an adjudication and does not preclude appointment in formal proceedings.

###### Sec. 13.16.125.   Informal appointment proceedings; notice requirements.

The moving party must give notice as described by AS 13.06.110 of intention to seek an appointment informally (1) to any person demanding it under AS 13.16.070; and (2) to any person having a prior or equal right to appointment not waived in writing and filed with the court.  No other notice of an informal appointment proceeding is required.

###### Sec. 13.16.130.   Informal appointment unavailable in certain cases.

If an application for informal appointment indicates the existence of a possible unrevoked testamentary instrument that may relate to property subject to the laws of this state, and that is not filed for probate in this court, the registrar shall decline the application.

#### Article 4. Formal Testacy and Appointment Proceedings.

###### Sec. 13.16.140.   Formal testacy proceedings; nature; when commenced.

(a) A formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid will.  A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced by an interested person filing a petition as described in AS 13.16.145(a) in which the person requests that the court, after notice and hearing, enter an order probating a will, or a petition to set aside an informal probate of a will or to prevent informal probate of a will that is the subject of a pending application, or a petition in accordance with AS 13.16.145(b) for an order that the decedent died intestate.

(b) A petition may seek formal probate of a will without regard to whether the same or a conflicting will has been informally probated.  A formal testacy proceeding may, but need not, involve a request for appointment of a personal representative.

(c) During the pendency of a formal testacy proceeding, the registrar shall not act upon any application for informal probate of any will of the decedent or any application for informal appointment of a personal representative of the decedent.

(d) Unless a petition in a formal testacy proceeding also requests confirmation of the previous informal appointment, a previously appointed personal representative, after receipt of notice of the commencement of a formal probate proceeding, must refrain from exercising the power to make any further distribution of the estate during the pendency of the formal proceeding.  A petitioner who seeks the appointment of a different personal representative in a formal proceeding also may request an order restraining the acting personal representative from exercising any of the personal representative's powers of office and requesting the appointment of a special administrator. In the absence of a request, or if the request is denied, the commencement of a formal proceeding has no effect on the powers and duties of a previously appointed personal representative other than those relating to distribution.

###### Sec. 13.16.145.   Formal testacy or appointment proceedings; petition; contents.

(a) Petitions for formal probate of a will, or for adjudication of intestacy with or without request for appointment of a personal representative, must be directed to the court, request a judicial order after notice and hearing, and contain further statements as indicated in this section.  A petition for formal probate of a will must

(1) request an order as to the testacy of the decedent in relation to a particular instrument which may or may not have been informally probated and determining the heirs;

(2) contain the statements required for informal applications as stated in AS 13.16.080(a)(1)(A)-(E), the statements required by AS 13.16.080(a)(2)(B) and (C); and

(3) state whether the original of the last will of the decedent is in the possession of the court or accompanies the petition.

(b) If the original will is neither in the possession of the court nor accompanies the petition and no authenticated copy of a will probated in another jurisdiction accompanies the petition, the petition also must state the contents of the will, and indicate that it is lost, destroyed, or otherwise unavailable.

(c) A petition for adjudication of intestacy and appointment of an administrator in intestacy must request a judicial finding and order that the decedent left no will and determining the heirs, contain the statements required by AS 13.16.080(a)(1) and (4) and indicate whether supervised administration is sought.  A petition may request an order determining intestacy and heirs without requesting the appointment of an administrator, in which case, the statements required by AS 13.16.080(a)(4)(B) may be omitted.

###### Sec. 13.16.150.   Formal testacy proceeding; notice of hearing on petition.

(a) Upon commencement of a formal testacy proceeding, the court shall fix a time and place of hearing. Notice shall be given in the manner prescribed by AS 13.06.110 by the petitioner to the persons enumerated in this subsection and to any additional person who has filed a demand for notice under AS 13.16.070.  Notice shall be given to the following persons: (1) the surviving spouse, children, and other heirs of the decedent; (2) the devisees and executors named in any will that is being, or has been probated or offered for informal or formal probate in the judicial district, or that is known by the petitioner to have been probated or offered for informal or formal probate elsewhere; and (3) any personal representative of the decedent whose appointment has not been terminated.  Notice may be given to other persons.  In addition, the petitioner shall give notice by publication to all unknown persons and to all known persons whose addresses are unknown who have any interest in the matters being litigated.

(b) If it appears by the petition or otherwise that the fact of the death of the alleged decedent may be in doubt, or on the written demand of any interested person, a copy of the notice of the hearing on the petition shall be sent by registered mail to the alleged decedent at the last known address of the alleged decedent.  The court shall direct the petitioner to report the results of, or make and report back concerning, a reasonably diligent search for the alleged decedent in any manner that may seem advisable, including any or all of the following methods: (1) by inserting in one or more suitable periodicals a notice requesting information from any person having knowledge of the whereabouts of the alleged decedent; (2) by notifying law enforcement officials and public welfare agencies in appropriate locations of the disappearance of the alleged decedent; (3) by engaging the services of an investigator; the costs of any search so directed shall be paid by the petitioner if there is no administration or by the estate of the decedent in case there is administration.

###### Sec. 13.16.155.   Formal testacy proceedings; written objections to probate.

Any party to a formal proceeding who opposes the probate of a will for any reason shall state in the pleadings the objections to probate of the will.

###### Sec. 13.16.160.   Formal testacy proceedings; uncontested cases; hearings and proof.

If a petition in a testacy proceeding is unopposed, the court may order probate or intestacy on the strength of the pleadings if satisfied that the conditions of AS 13.16.180 have been met, or conduct a hearing in open court and require proof of the matters necessary to support the order sought. If evidence concerning execution of the will is necessary, the affidavit or testimony of one of any attesting witnesses to the instrument is sufficient.  If the affidavit or testimony of an attesting witness is not available, execution of the will may be proved by other evidence or affidavit.

###### Sec. 13.16.165.   Formal testacy proceedings; contested cases; testimony of attesting witnesses.

(a) If evidence concerning execution of an attested will that is not self-proved is necessary in contested cases, the testimony of at least one of the attesting witnesses, if within the state, competent, and able to testify, is required.  Due execution of an attested or unattested will may be proved by other evidence.

(b) If the will is self-proved, compliance with signature requirements for execution is conclusively presumed and other requirements of execution are presumed subject to rebuttal without the testimony of any witness upon filing the will and the acknowledgment and affidavits annexed or attached to it, unless there is proof of fraud or forgery affecting the acknowledgment or affidavit.

###### Sec. 13.16.170.   Formal testacy proceedings; burdens in contested cases.

In contested cases, petitioners who seek to establish intestacy have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death, venue, and heirship.  Proponents of a will have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases, and if they are also petitioners, prima facie proof of death and venue.  Contestants of a will have the burden of establishing lack of testamentary intent or capacity, undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake, or revocation.  Parties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof.  If a will is opposed by the petition for probate of a later will revoking the former, it shall be determined first whether the later will is entitled to probate, and if a will is opposed by a petition for a declaration of intestacy, it shall be determined first whether the will is entitled to probate.

###### Sec. 13.16.175.   Formal testacy proceedings; will construction; effect of final order in another jurisdiction.

Subject to AS 13.06.068, a final order of a court of another state determining testacy, the validity, or construction of a will made in a proceeding involving notice to and an opportunity for contest by all interested persons must be accepted as determinative by the courts of this state if it includes, or is based upon, a finding that the decedent was domiciled at death in the state where the order was made.

###### Sec. 13.16.180.   Formal testacy proceedings; order; foreign will.

After the time required for any notice has expired, upon proof of notice, and after any hearing that may be necessary, if the court finds that the testator is dead, that venue is proper, and that the proceeding was commenced within the limitation prescribed by  AS 13.16.040, it shall determine the decedent's domicile at death, any heirs, and the state of testacy of the decedent.  Any will found to be valid and unrevoked shall be formally probated.  Termination of any previous informal appointment of a personal representative that may be appropriate in view of the relief requested and findings is governed by  AS 13.16.300. The petition shall be dismissed or appropriate amendment allowed if the court is not satisfied that the alleged decedent is dead.  A will from a place that does not provide for probate of a will after death, may be proved for probate in this state by a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian that the copy introduced is a true copy and that the will has become effective under the law of the other place.

###### Sec. 13.16.185.   Formal testacy proceedings; probate of more than one instrument.

If two or more instruments are offered for probate before a final order is entered in a formal testacy proceeding, more than one instrument may be probated if neither expressly revokes the other or contains provisions that work a total revocation by implication.  If more than one instrument is probated, the order shall indicate what provisions control in respect to the nomination of an executor, if any.  The order may, but need not, indicate how any provisions of a particular instrument are affected by the other instrument.  After a final order in a testacy proceeding has been entered, no petition for probate of any other instrument of the decedent may be entertained, except incident to a petition to vacate or modify a previous probate order and subject to the time limits of AS 13.16.195.

###### Sec. 13.16.190.   Formal testacy proceedings; partial intestacy.

If it becomes evident in the course of a formal testacy proceeding that, though one or more instruments are entitled to be probated, the decedent's estate is or may be partially intestate, the court shall enter an order to that effect.

###### Sec. 13.16.195.   Formal testacy proceedings; effect of order; vacation.

(a) Subject to appeal and subject to vacation as provided in this section and in AS 13.16.200, a formal testacy order under AS 13.16.180§13.16.190, including an order that the decedent did not leave a valid will and determining heirs, is final as to all persons with respect to all issues concerning the decedent's estate that the court considered or might have considered incident to its rendition relevant to the question of whether the decedent left a valid will, and to the determination of heirs, except that

(1) the court shall entertain a petition for modification or vacation of its order and probate of another will of the decedent if it is shown that the proponents of the later-offered will were

(A) unaware of the later-offered will's existence at the time of the earlier proceeding; or

(B) unaware of the earlier proceeding and were not given notice of the proceeding, except by publication;

(2) if intestacy of all or part of the estate has been ordered, the determination of heirs of the decedent may be reconsidered if it is shown that one or more persons were omitted from the determination and it is also shown that the persons were unaware of their relationship to the decedent, were unaware of the death, or were not given notice of any proceeding concerning the estate, except by publication;

(3) a petition for vacation under either (1) or (2) of this subsection must be filed before the earliest of the following time limits:

(A) if a personal representative has been appointed for the estate, the time of entry of an order approving final distribution of the estate, or, if the estate is closed by statement, six months after the filing of the closing statement;

(B) whether or not a personal representative has been appointed for the estate of the decedent, the time prescribed by AS 13.16.040 when it is no longer possible to initiate an original proceeding to probate a will of the decedent; or

(C) 12 months after the entry of the order sought to be vacated;

(4) the order originally rendered in the testacy proceeding may be modified or vacated, if appropriate under the circumstances, by the order of probate of the later-offered will or the order redetermining heirs;

(5) the finding of the fact of death is conclusive as to the alleged decedent only if notice of the hearing on the petition in the formal testacy proceeding was sent by registered or certified mail addressed to the alleged decedent at the last known address of the alleged decedent and the court finds that a search under AS 13.16.150(b) was made.

(b) If the alleged decedent is not dead, even if notice was sent and search was made, the alleged decedent may recover estate assets in the hands of the personal representative.  In addition to any remedies available to the alleged decedent by reason of any fraud or intentional wrongdoing, the alleged decedent may recover any estate or its proceeds from distributees that is in their hands, or the value of distributions received by them, to the extent that any recovery from distributees is equitable in view of all of the circumstances.

###### Sec. 13.16.200.   Formal testacy proceedings; vacation of order for other cause.

For good cause shown, an order in a formal testacy proceeding may be modified or vacated within the time allowed for appeal.

###### Sec. 13.16.205.   Formal proceedings concerning appointment of personal representative.

(a) A formal proceeding for adjudication regarding the priority or qualification of one who is an applicant for appointment as personal representative, or of one who previously has been appointed personal representative in informal proceedings, if an issue concerning the testacy of the decedent is or may be involved, is governed by AS 13.16.145, as well as by this section.  In other cases, the petition must contain or adopt the statements required by AS 13.16.080(a)(1) and describe the question relating to priority or qualification of the personal representative that is to be resolved.  If the proceeding precedes any appointment of a personal representative, it shall stay any pending informal appointment proceedings as well as any commenced thereafter.  If the proceeding is commenced after appointment, the previously appointed personal representative, after receipt of notice thereof, shall refrain from exercising any power of administration except as necessary to preserve the estate or unless the court orders otherwise.

(b) After notice to interested persons, including all persons interested in the administration of the estate as successors under the applicable assumption concerning testacy, any previously appointed personal representative and any person having or claiming priority for appointment as personal representative, the court shall determine who is entitled to appointment under AS 13.16.065, make a proper appointment and, if appropriate, terminate any prior appointment found to have been improper as provided in cases of removal under AS 13.16.295.

#### Article 5. Supervised Administration.

###### Sec. 13.16.215.   Supervised administration; nature of proceeding.

Supervised administration is a single in rem proceeding to secure complete administration and settlement of a decedent's estate under the continuing authority of the court which extends until entry of an order approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative or other order terminating the proceeding.  A supervised personal representative is responsible to the court, as well as to the interested parties, and is subject to directions concerning the estate made by the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party. Except as otherwise provided in AS 13.16.215 §13.16.235, or as otherwise ordered by the court, a supervised personal representative has the same duties and powers as a personal representative who is not supervised.

###### Sec. 13.16.220.   Supervised administration; petition; order.

A petition for supervised administration may be filed by any interested person or by a personal representative at any time or the prayer for supervised administration may be joined with a petition in a testacy or appointment proceeding.  If the testacy of the decedent and the priority and qualification of any personal representative have not been adjudicated previously, the petition for supervised administration must include the matters required of a petition in a formal testacy proceeding and the notice requirements and procedures applicable to a formal testacy proceeding apply.  If not previously adjudicated, the court shall adjudicate the testacy of the decedent and questions relating to the priority and qualifications of the personal representative in any case involving a request for supervised administration, even though the request for supervised administration may be denied. After notice to interested persons, the court shall order supervised administration of a decedent's estate as follows:

(1) if the decedent's will directs supervised administration, it shall be ordered unless the court finds that circumstances bearing on the need for supervised administration have changed since the execution of the will and that there is no necessity for supervised administration;

(2) if the decedent's will directs unsupervised administration, supervised administration shall be ordered only upon a finding that it is necessary for protection of persons interested in the estate; or

(3) in other cases if the court finds that supervised administration is necessary under the circumstances.

###### Sec. 13.16.225.   Supervised administration; effect on other proceedings.

(a) The pendency of a proceeding for supervised administration of a decedent's estate stays action on any informal application then pending or thereafter filed.

(b) If a will has been previously probated in informal proceedings, the effect of the filing of a petition for supervised administration is as provided for formal testacy proceedings by AS 13.16.140.

(c) After receiving notice of the filing of a petition for supervised administration, a personal representative who has been appointed previously may not exercise the power to distribute any estate.  The filing of the petition does not affect other powers and duties unless the court restricts the exercise of any of them pending full hearing on the petition.

###### Sec. 13.16.230.   Supervised administration; powers of personal representative.

Unless restricted by the court, a supervised personal representative has, without interim orders approving exercise of a power, all powers of personal representatives under AS 13.06 § AS 13.36, but a supervised personal representative may not exercise the power to make any distribution of the estate without prior order of the court.  Any other restriction on the power of a personal representative that may be ordered by the court must be endorsed on the letters of appointment and, unless so endorsed, is ineffective as to persons dealing in good faith with the personal representative.

###### Sec. 13.16.235.   Supervised administration; interim orders; distribution and closing orders.

Unless otherwise ordered by the court, supervised administration is terminated by order in accordance with time restrictions, notices, and contents of orders prescribed for proceedings under AS 13.16.620.  Interim orders approving or directing partial distributions or granting other relief may be issued by the court at any time during the pendency of a supervised administration on the application of the personal representative or any interested person.

#### Article 6. Personal Representative; Appointment, Control and Termination of Authority.

###### Sec. 13.16.245.   Qualification.

Before receiving letters, a personal representative shall qualify by filing with the appointing court any required bond and a statement of acceptance of the duties of the office.

###### Sec. 13.16.250.   Acceptance of appointment; consent to jurisdiction.

By accepting appointment, a personal representative submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding relating to the estate that may be instituted by any interested person.  Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the personal representative, or mailed by ordinary first-class mail to the personal representative at the address as listed in the application or petition for appointment or as thereafter reported to the court and to the personal representative's address as then known to the petitioner.

###### Sec. 13.16.255.   Bond required; exceptions.

A personal representative shall execute and file a bond with the registrar unless

(1) the estate is testate and the will expressly waives surety bond as to the person qualifying as personal representative;

(2) the devisees or the heirs file written waiver of surety bond;

(3) the personal representative is a qualified corporate fiduciary; or

(4) the personal representative, pursuant to statute, has deposited cash or collateral with an agency of the state to secure performance of the personal representative's duties.

###### Sec. 13.16.260.   Bond amount; security; procedure; reduction.

If bond is required and the provisions of the will or order do not specify the amount, unless stated in the application or petition, the person qualifying shall file a statement under oath with the registrar indicating the person's best estimate of the value of the personal estate of the decedent and of the income expected from the personal and real estate during the next year. The person qualifying shall execute and file a bond with the registrar, or give other suitable security, in an amount not less than the estimate. The registrar shall determine that the bond is duly executed by a corporate surety, or one or more individual sureties whose performance is secured by pledge of personal property, mortgage on real property, or other adequate security. The registrar may permit the amount of the bond to be reduced by the value of assets of the estate deposited with a domestic financial institution, as defined in AS 13.33.201, in a manner that prevents their unauthorized disposition. On petition of the personal representative or another interested person the court may excuse a requirement of bond, increase or reduce the amount of the bond, release sureties, or permit the substitution of another bond with the same or different sureties.

###### Sec. 13.16.265.   Demand for bond by interested person.

Any person apparently having an interest in the estate worth in excess of $1,000, or any creditor having a claim in excess of $1,000, may make a written demand that a personal representative give bond.  The demand must be filed with the registrar and a copy mailed to the personal representative, if appointment and qualification have occurred.  Thereupon, bond is required, but the requirement ceases if the person demanding bond ceases to be interested in the estate, or if bond is excused as provided in AS 13.16.255 or 13.16.260. After receiving notice and until the filing of the bond or cessation of the requirement of bond, the personal representative shall refrain from exercising any powers of the personal representative's office except as necessary to preserve the estate.  Failure of the personal representative to meet a requirement of bond by giving suitable bond within 30 days after receipt of notice is cause for removal and appointment of a successor personal representative.

###### Sec. 13.16.270.   Terms and conditions of bonds.

(a) The following requirements and provisions apply to any bond required by AS 13.16.245 § 13.16.330:

(1) bonds shall name the state as obligee for the benefit of persons interested in the estate and shall be conditioned upon the faithful discharge by the fiduciary of all duties according to law;

(2) unless otherwise provided by the terms of the approved bond, sureties are jointly and severally liable with the personal representative and with each other; the address of each surety shall be stated in the bond;

(3) by executing an approved bond of a personal representative, the surety consents to the jurisdiction of the probate court that issued letters to the primary obligor in any proceedings pertaining to the fiduciary duties of the personal representative and naming the surety as a party; notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the surety or mailed by registered or certified mail to the surety at the address as listed with the court where the bond is filed and to the surety's address as then known to the petitioner;

(4) on petition of a successor personal representative, any other personal representative of the same decedent, or any interested person, a proceeding in the court may be initiated against a surety for breach of the obligation of the bond of the personal representative;

(5) the bond of the personal representative is not void after the first recovery but may be proceeded against from time to time until the whole penalty is exhausted.

(b) No action or proceeding may be commenced against the surety on any matter as to which an action or proceeding against the primary obligor is barred by adjudication or limitation.

###### Sec. 13.16.275.   Order restraining personal representative.

(a) On petition of any person who appears to have an interest in the estate, the court by temporary order may restrain a personal representative from performing specified acts of administration, disbursement, or distribution, or exercise of any powers or discharge of any duties of the personal representative's office, or make any other order to secure proper performance of the personal representative's duty, if it appears to the court that the personal representative otherwise may take some action that would jeopardize unreasonably the interest of the applicant or of some other interested person.  Persons with whom the personal representative may transact business may be made parties.

(b) The matter shall be set for hearing within 10 days unless the parties otherwise agree.  Notice as the court directs shall be given to the personal representative and the personal representative's attorney of record, if any, and to any other parties named defendant in the petition.

###### Sec. 13.16.280.   Termination of appointment; general.

Termination of appointment of a personal representative occurs as indicated in AS 13.16.285 § 13.16.300. Termination ends the right and power pertaining to the office of personal representative as conferred by AS 13.06§AS 13.36 or any will, except that a personal representative, at any time before distribution or until restrained or enjoined by court order, may perform acts necessary to protect the estate and may deliver the assets to a successor representative. Termination does not discharge a personal representative from liability for transactions or omissions occurring before termination, or relieve the personal representative of the duty to preserve assets subject to the personal representative's control, to account therefor, and to deliver the assets.  Termination does not affect the jurisdiction of the court over the personal representative, but terminates the personal representative's authority to represent the estate in any pending or future proceeding.

###### Sec. 13.16.285.   Termination of appointment; death or disability.

The death of a personal representative or the appointment of a conservator for the estate of a personal representative, terminates the personal representative's appointment.  Until appointment and qualification of a successor or special representative to replace the deceased or protected representative, the representative of the estate of the deceased or protected personal representative, if any, has the duty to protect the estate possessed and being administered by the decedent or ward at the time the appointment terminates, has the power to perform acts necessary for protection, and shall account for and deliver the estate assets to a successor or special personal representative upon appointment and qualification.

###### Sec. 13.16.290.   Termination of appointment; voluntary.

(a) An appointment of a personal representative terminates as provided in AS 13.16.630, one year after the filing of a closing statement.

(b) An order closing an estate as provided in AS 13.16.620 or 13.16.625 terminates an appointment of a personal representative.

(c) A personal representative may resign the position by filing a written statement of resignation with the registrar after giving at least 15 days' written notice to the persons known to be interested in the estate.  If no one applies or petitions for appointment of a successor representative within the time indicated in the notice, the filed statement of resignation is ineffective as a termination of appointment and in any event is effective only upon the appointment and qualification of a successor representative and delivery of the assets to that successor.

###### Sec. 13.16.295.   Termination of appointment by removal; cause; procedure.

(a) A person interested in the estate may petition for removal of a personal representative for cause at any time. Upon filing of the petition, the court shall fix a time and place for hearing.  Notice shall be given by the petitioner to the personal representative, and to other persons as the court may order.  Except as otherwise ordered as provided in AS 13.16.275, after receipt of notice of removal proceedings, the personal representative shall not act except to account, to correct maladministration or preserve the estate.  If removal is ordered, the court also shall direct by order the disposition of the assets remaining in the name of, or under the control of, the personal representative being removed.

(b) Cause for removal exists when removal would be in the best interests of the estate, or if it is shown that a personal representative or the person seeking appointment intentionally misrepresented material facts in the proceedings leading to appointment, or that the personal representative has disregarded an order of the court, has become incapable of discharging the duties of the office, or has mismanaged the estate or failed to perform any duty pertaining to the office.  Unless the decedent's will directs otherwise, a personal representative appointed at the decedent's domicile, incident to securing appointment either personally or for a nominee as ancillary personal representative, may obtain removal of another who was appointed personal representative in this state to administer local assets.

###### Sec. 13.16.300.   Termination of appointment; change of testacy status.

Except as otherwise ordered in formal proceedings, the probate of a will subsequent to the appointment of a personal representative in intestacy or under a will that is superseded by formal probate of another will, or the vacation of an informal probate of a will subsequent to the appointment of the personal representative under it, does not terminate the appointment of the personal representative although the personal representative's powers may be reduced as provided in AS 13.16.140. Termination occurs upon appointment in informal or formal appointment proceedings of a person entitled to appointment under the later assumption concerning testacy.  If no request for new appointment is made within 30 days after expiration of time for appeal from the order in formal testacy proceedings, or from the informal probate, changing the assumption concerning testacy, the previously appointed personal representative upon request may be appointed personal representative under the subsequently probated will, or as in intestacy as the case may be.

###### Sec. 13.16.305.   Successor personal representative.

AS 13.16.080 § 13.16.205 govern proceedings for appointment of a personal representative to succeed one whose appointment has been terminated.  After appointment and qualification, a successor personal representative may be substituted in all actions and proceedings to which the former personal representative was a party, and no notice, process, or claim that was given or served upon the former personal representative need be given to or served upon the successor in order to preserve any position or right the person giving the notice or filing the claim may thereby have obtained or preserved with reference to the former personal representative.  Except as otherwise ordered by the court, the successor personal representative has the powers and duties in respect to the continued administration that the former personal representative would have had if the appointment had not been terminated.

###### Sec. 13.16.310.   Special administrator; appointment.

A special administrator may be appointed

(1) informally by the registrar on the application of any interested person when necessary to protect the estate of a decedent before the appointment of a general personal representative or if a prior appointment has been terminated as provided in AS 13.16.285;

(2) in a formal proceeding by order of the court on the petition of any interested person and finding, after notice and hearing, that appointment is necessary to preserve the estate or to secure its proper administration, including its administration in circumstances where a general personal representative cannot or should not act; if it appears to the court that an emergency exists, appointment may be ordered without notice.

###### Sec. 13.16.315.   Special administrator; who may be appointed.

(a) If a special administrator is to be appointed pending the probate of a will that is the subject of a pending application or petition for probate, the person named executor in the will shall be appointed if available and qualified.

(b) In other cases, any proper person may be appointed special administrator.

###### Sec. 13.16.320.   Special administrator appointed informally; powers and duties.

A special administrator appointed by the registrar in informal proceedings pursuant to AS 13.16.310(1) has the duty to collect and manage the assets of the estate, to preserve them, to account for them, and to deliver them to the general personal representative upon qualification.  The special administrator has the power of a personal representative under AS 13.06 § AS 13.36 necessary to perform the special administrator's duties.

###### Sec. 13.16.325.   Special administrator appointed by court; power and duties.

A special administrator appointed by order of the court in any formal proceeding has the power of a general personal representative except as limited in the appointment and duties as prescribed in the order.  The appointment may be for a specified time, to perform particular acts, or on other terms as the court may direct.

###### Sec. 13.16.330.   Termination of appointment; special administrator.

The appointment of a special administrator terminates in accordance with the provisions of the order of appointment or on the appointment of a general personal representative.  In other cases, the appointment of a special administrator is subject to termination as provided in AS 13.16.280 §13.16.295.

#### Article 7. Duties and Powers of Personal Representatives.

###### Sec. 13.16.340.   Time of accrual of duties and powers.

The duties and powers of a personal representative commence upon appointment.  The powers of a personal representative relate back in time to give acts by the person appointed that are beneficial to the estate occurring prior to appointment the same effect as those occurring thereafter.  Prior to appointment, a person named executor in a will may carry out written instructions of the decedent relating to the decedent's body, funeral, and burial arrangements.  A personal representative may ratify and accept acts on behalf of the estate done by others where the acts would have been proper for a personal representative.

###### Sec. 13.16.345.   Priority among different letters.

A person to whom general letters are issued first has exclusive authority under the letters until the appointment is terminated or modified.  If, through error, general letters are afterwards issued to another, the first appointed representative may recover any property of the estate in the hands of the representative subsequently appointed, but the acts of the latter done in good faith before notice of the first letters are not void for want of validity of appointment.

###### Sec. 13.16.350.   General duties; standard of care; relation and liability to persons interested in estate; standing to sue.

(a) A personal representative is a fiduciary who shall observe the standards of care applicable to trustees under AS 13.36.225§13.36.290. A personal representative is under a duty to settle and distribute the estate of the decedent in accordance with the terms of any probated and effective will and AS 13.06§AS 13.36, and as expeditiously and efficiently as is consistent with the best interests of the estate. A personal representative shall use the authority conferred by AS 13.06§AS 13.36, the terms of the will, if any, and any order in proceedings to which the personal representative is party for the best interests of successors to the estate.

(b) A personal representative may not be surcharged for acts of administration or distribution if the conduct in question was authorized at the time.  Subject to other obligations of administration, an informally probated will is authority to administer and distribute the estate according to its terms. An order of appointment of a personal representative, whether issued in informal or formal proceedings, is authority to distribute apparently intestate assets to the heirs of the decedent if, at the time of distribution, the personal representative is not aware of a pending testacy proceeding, a proceeding to vacate an order entered in an earlier testacy proceeding, a formal proceeding questioning the appointment or fitness to continue, or a supervised administration proceeding. Nothing in this section affects the duty of the personal representative to administer and distribute the estate in accordance with the rights of claimants, the surviving spouse, any minor and dependent children and any pretermitted child of the decedent as described elsewhere in AS 13.06 § AS 13.36.

(c) Except as to proceedings that do not survive the death of the decedent, a personal representative of a decedent domiciled in this state at death has the same standing to sue and be sued in the courts of this state and the courts of any other jurisdiction as the decedent had immediately before death.

###### Sec. 13.16.355.   Personal representative to proceed without court order; exception.

A personal representative shall proceed expeditiously with the settlement and distribution of a decedent's estate and, except as otherwise specified or ordered in regard to a supervised personal representative, do so without adjudication, order, or direction of the court, but the personal representative may invoke the jurisdiction of the court, in proceedings authorized by AS 13.06 § AS 13.36, to resolve questions concerning the estate or its administration.

###### Sec. 13.16.360.   Duty of personal representative; information to heirs and devisees.

Not later than 30 days after appointment, every personal representative, except any special administrator, shall give information of the appointment to the heirs and devisees, including, if there has been no formal testacy proceeding and if the personal representative was appointed on the assumption that the decedent died intestate, the devisees in any will mentioned in the application for appointment of a personal representative. The information shall be delivered or sent by ordinary mail to each of the heirs and devisees whose address is reasonably available to the personal representative. The duty does not extend to require information to persons who have been adjudicated in a prior formal testacy proceeding to have no interest in the estate.  The information must include the name and address of the personal representative, indicate that it is being sent to persons who have or may have some interest in the estate being administered, indicate whether bond has been filed, and describe the court where papers relating to the estate are on file.  The personal representative's failure to give this information is a breach of duty to the persons concerned but does not affect the validity of the appointment, the personal representative's powers or other duties.  A personal representative may inform other persons of the appointment by delivery or ordinary first-class mail.

###### Sec. 13.16.365.   Duty of personal representative; inventory and appraisal.

(a) Within three months after appointment, a personal representative, who is not a special administrator or a successor to another representative who has previously discharged this duty, shall prepare and file or mail an inventory of property owned by the decedent at the time of death, listing it with reasonable detail, and indicating as to each listed item, its fair market value as of the date of the decedent's death, and the type and amount of any encumbrance that may exist with reference to any item.

(b) The personal representative shall send a copy of the inventory to interested persons who request it.  The personal representative may also file the original of the inventory with the court.

###### Sec. 13.16.370.   Employment of appraisers.

The personal representative may employ a qualified and disinterested appraiser to assist in ascertaining the fair market value as of the date of the decedent's death of any asset the value of which may be subject to reasonable doubt. Different persons may be employed to appraise different kinds of assets included in the estate. The names and addresses of any appraiser shall be indicated on the inventory with the item or items appraised.

###### Sec. 13.16.375.   Duty of personal representative; supplementary inventory.

If any property not included in the original inventory comes to the knowledge of a personal representative or if the personal representative learns that the value or description indicated in the original inventory for any item is erroneous or misleading, the personal representative shall make a supplementary inventory or appraisal showing the market value as of the date of the decedent's death of the new item or the revised market value or descriptions, and the appraisers or other data relied upon, if any, and file it with the court if the original inventory was filed, or furnish copies of it or information on it to persons interested in the new information.

###### Sec. 13.16.380.   Duty of personal representative; possession of estate.

Except as otherwise provided by a decedent's will, every personal representative has a right to, and shall take possession or control of, the decedent's property, except that any real property or tangible personal property may be left with or surrendered to the person presumptively entitled to it unless or until, in the judgment of the personal representative, possession of the property by the personal representative will be necessary for purposes of administration.  The request by a personal representative for delivery of any property possessed by an heir or devisee is conclusive evidence, in any action against the heir or devisee for possession of it, that the possession of the property by the personal representative is necessary for purposes of administration.  The personal representative shall pay taxes on, and take all steps reasonably necessary for the management, protection, and preservation of, the estate in the personal representative's possession.  The personal representative may maintain an action to recover possession of property or to determine the title to it.

###### Sec. 13.16.381.   Disposition of unclaimed estate by personal representative.

When there is no taker of an intestate estate, or if an heir, devisee, or claimant cannot be found and the missing person has no conservator, the personal representative shall handle the

(1) unclaimed personal property of the estate in accordance with AS 34.45.280§34.45.780; and

(2) unclaimed real property of the estate in accordance with AS 38.95.

###### Sec. 13.16.385.   Power to avoid transfers.

The property liable for the payment of unsecured debts of a decedent includes all property transferred by the decedent by any means that is in law void or voidable as against creditors, and subject to prior liens, the right to recover this property, so far as necessary for the payment of unsecured debts of the decedent, is exclusively in the personal representative.

###### Sec. 13.16.390.   Powers of personal representatives; in general.

Until termination of appointment, a personal representative has the same power over the title to property of the estate that an absolute owner would have, in trust however, for the benefit of the creditors and others interested in the estate. This power may be exercised without notice, hearing, or order of court.

###### Sec. 13.16.395.   Improper exercise of power; breach of fiduciary duty.

If the exercise of power concerning the estate is improper, the personal representative is liable to interested persons for damage or loss resulting from breach of fiduciary duty to the same extent as a trustee of an express trust.  The rights of purchasers and others dealing with a personal representative shall be determined as provided in AS 13.16.400 and 13.16.405.

###### Sec. 13.16.400.   Sale, encumbrance, or transaction involving conflict of interest voidable; exceptions.

Any sale or encumbrance to the personal representative, the personal representative's spouse, agent, or attorney, or any corporation or trust in which the personal representative has a substantial beneficial interest, or any transaction that is affected by a substantial conflict of interest on the part of the personal representative, is voidable by any person interested in the estate except one who has consented after fair disclosure, unless

(1) the will or a contract entered into by the decedent expressly authorized the transaction; or

(2) the transaction is approved by the court after notice to interested persons.

###### Sec. 13.16.405.   Persons dealing with personal representative; protection.

A person who in good faith either assists a personal representative or deals with the personal representative for value is protected as if the personal representative properly exercised the personal representative's power.  The fact that a person knowingly deals with a personal representative does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise.  Except for restrictions on powers of supervised personal representatives which are endorsed on letters as provided in AS 13.16.230, no provision in any will or order of court purporting to limit the power of a personal representative is effective except as to persons with actual knowledge of it.  A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a personal representative.  The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters, including a case in which the alleged decedent is found to be alive.  The protection here expressed is not by substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.

###### Sec. 13.16.410.   Transactions authorized for personal representatives; exceptions.

Except as restricted or otherwise provided by the will or by an order in a formal proceeding and subject to the priorities stated in AS 13.16.540, a personal representative, acting reasonably for the benefit of the interested persons, may properly

(1) retain assets owned by the decedent pending distribution or liquidation, including those in which the representative is personally interested or that are otherwise improper for trust investment;

(2) receive assets from fiduciaries, or other sources;

(3) perform, compromise, or refuse performance of the decedent's contracts that continue as obligations of the estate, as the personal representative may determine under the circumstances; in performing enforceable contracts by the decedent to convey or lease land, the personal representative, among other possible courses of action, may:

(A) execute and deliver a deed of conveyance for cash payment of all sums remaining due or the purchaser's note for the sum remaining due secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on the land; or

(B) deliver a deed in escrow with directions that the proceeds, when paid in accordance with the escrow agreement, be paid to the successors of the decedent, as designated in the escrow agreement;

(4) satisfy written charitable pledges of the decedent irrespective of whether the pledges constituted binding obligations of the decedent or were properly presented as claims, if in the judgment of the personal representative the decedent would have wanted the pledges completed under the circumstances;

(5) if funds are not needed to meet debts and expenses currently payable and are not immediately distributable, deposit or invest liquid assets of the estate, including money received from the sale of other assets, in federally insured interest-bearing accounts, readily marketable secured loan arrangements, or other prudent investments which would be reasonable for use by trustees generally;

(6) acquire or dispose of an asset, including land in this or another state, for cash or on credit, at public or private sale; and manage, develop, improve, exchange, partition, change the character of, or abandon an estate asset;

(7) make ordinary or extraordinary repairs or alterations in buildings or other structures, demolish any improvements, raze existing or erect new party walls or buildings;

(8) subdivide, develop or dedicate land to public use; make or obtain the vacation of plats and adjust boundaries; or adjust differences in valuation on exchange or partition by giving or receiving considerations; or dedicate easements to public use without consideration;

(9) enter for any purpose into a lease as lessor or lessee, with or without option to purchase or renew, for a term within or extending beyond the period of administration;

(10) enter into a lease or arrangement for exploration and removal of minerals or other natural resources or enter into a pooling or unitization agreement;

(11) abandon property when, in the opinion of the personal representative, it is valueless, or is so encumbered, or is in condition that it is of no benefit to the estate;

(12) vote stocks or other securities in person or by general or limited proxy;

(13) pay calls, assessment, and other sums chargeable or accruing against or on account of securities, unless barred by the provisions relating to claims;

(14) hold a security in the name of a nominee or in other form without disclosure of the interest of the estate, but the personal representative is liable for any act of the nominee in connection with the security so held;

(15) insure the assets of the estate against damage, loss, and liability and insure the personal representative against liability as to third persons;

(16) borrow money with or without security to be repaid from the estate assets or otherwise; and advance money for the protection of the estate;

(17) effect a fair and reasonable compromise with any debtor or obligor, or extend, renew, or in any manner modify the terms of any obligation owing to the estate; if the personal representative holds a mortgage, pledge, or other lien upon property of another person, the personal representative may, in place of foreclosure, accept a conveyance or transfer of encumbered assets from the owner of it in satisfaction of the indebtedness secured by lien;

(18) pay taxes, assessments, compensation of the personal representative, and other expenses incident to the administration of the estate;

(19) sell or exercise stock subscription or conversion rights; consent, directly or through a committee or other agent, to the reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, or liquidation of a corporation or other business enterprise;

(20) allocate items of income or expense to either estate income or principal, as permitted or provided by law;

(21) employ persons, including attorneys, auditors, investment advisors, or agents, even if they are associated with the personal representative, to advise or assist the personal representative in the performance of administrative duties; act without independent investigation upon their recommendations; and instead of acting personally, employ one or more agents to perform any act of administration, whether or not discretionary;

(22) prosecute or defend claims, or proceedings in any jurisdiction for the protection of the estate and of the personal representative in the performance of the personal representative's duties;

(23) sell, mortgage, or lease any real or personal property of the estate or any interest in it for cash, credit, or for part cash and part credit, and with or without security for unpaid balances;

(24) continue any unincorporated business or venture in which the decedent was engaged at the time of death

(A) in the same business form for a period of not more than four months from the date of appointment of a general personal representative if continuation is a reasonable means of preserving the value of the business including good will;

(B) in the same business form for any additional period of time that may be approved by order of the court in a formal proceeding to which the persons interested in the estate are parties; or

(C) throughout the period of administration if the business is incorporated by the personal representative and if none of the probable distributees of the business who are competent adults object to its incorporation and retention in the estate;

(25) incorporate any business or venture in which the decedent was engaged at the time of death;

(26) provide for exoneration of the personal representative from personal liability in any contract entered into on behalf of the estate;

(27) satisfy and settle claims and distribute the estate as provided in AS 13.06 § 13.36;

(28) consider discretionary distributions to a beneficiary as being made from capital gains realized during the year.

###### Sec. 13.16.415.   Powers and duties of successor personal representative.

A successor personal representative has the same power and duty as the original personal representative to complete the administration and distribution of the estate, as expeditiously as possible, but the successor may not exercise any power expressly made personal to the executor named in the will.

###### Sec. 13.16.420.   Co-representatives; when joint action required.

If two or more persons are appointed co-representatives and unless the will provides otherwise, the concurrence of all is required on all acts connected with the administration and distribution of the estate. This restriction does not apply when any co-representative receives and gives a receipt for property due the estate, when the concurrence of all cannot readily be obtained in the time reasonably available for emergency action necessary to preserve the estate, or when a co-representative has been delegated to act for the others. Persons dealing with a co-representative, if actually unaware that another has been appointed to serve or if advised by the personal representative with whom they deal that the personal representative has authority to act alone for any of the reasons mentioned herein, are as fully protected as if the person with whom they dealt had been the sole personal representative.

###### Sec. 13.16.425.   Powers of surviving personal representative.

Unless the terms of the will provide otherwise, every power exercisable by personal co-representatives may be exercised by the one or more remaining after the appointment of one or more is terminated, and if one of two or more nominated as co-executors is not appointed, those appointed may exercise all the powers incident to the office.

###### Sec. 13.16.430.   Compensation of personal representative.

A personal representative is entitled to reasonable compensation for services.  If a will provides for compensation of the personal representative and there is no contract with the decedent regarding compensation, the personal representative may renounce the provision before qualifying and be entitled to reasonable compensation.  A personal representative also may renounce the right to all or any part of the compensation.  A written renunciation of fee may be filed with the court.

###### Sec. 13.16.435.   Expenses in estate litigation.

If any personal representative or person nominated as personal representative defends or prosecutes any proceeding in good faith, whether successful or not, that person is entitled to receive from the estate necessary expenses and disbursements including reasonable attorney fees incurred.

###### Sec. 13.16.440.   Review of employment of agents and other persons and compensation of personal representatives and other persons.

After notice to all interested persons or on petition of an interested person or on appropriate motion if administration is supervised, the propriety of employment of any person by a personal representative including any attorney, auditor, investment advisor, or other specialized agent or assistant, the reasonableness of the compensation of any person so employed, or the reasonableness of the compensation determined by the personal representative for the personal representative's services, may be reviewed by the court.  Any person who has received excessive compensation from an estate for services rendered may be ordered to make appropriate refunds.

#### Article 8. Creditors' Claims.

###### Sec. 13.16.450.   Notice to creditors.

Unless notice has already been given under this section, a personal representative upon appointment shall publish a notice once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial district announcing the appointment and address and notifying creditors of the estate to present their claims within four months after the date of the first publication of the notice or be forever barred.

###### Sec. 13.16.455.   Statutes of limitations.

Unless an estate is insolvent, the personal representative, with the consent of all successors whose interests would be affected, may waive any defense of limitations available to the estate.  If the defense is not waived, no claim that was barred by any statute of limitations at the time of the decedent's death shall be allowed or paid.  The running of any statute of limitations measured from some other event than death and advertisement for claims against a decedent is suspended during the four months following the decedent's death but resumes thereafter as to claims not barred pursuant to the sections that follow.  For purposes of any statute of limitations, the proper presentation of a claim under AS 13.16.465 is equivalent to commencement of a proceeding on the claim.

###### Sec. 13.16.460.   Limitations on presentation of claims.

(a) All claims against a decedent's estate that arose before the death of the decedent, including claims of the state and any subdivision of it, whether due or to become due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, founded on contract, tort, or other legal basis, if not barred earlier by other statute of limitations, are barred against the estate, the personal representative, and the heirs and devisees of the decedent, unless presented as follows:

(1) within four months after the date of the first publication of notice to creditors if notice is given in compliance with AS 13.16.450; however, claims barred by the nonclaim statute at the decedent's domicile before the first publication for claims in this state are also barred in this state;

(2) within three years after the decedent's death, if notice to creditors has not been published.

(b) All claims against a decedent's estate that arise at or after the death of the decedent, including claims of the state and any subdivision of it, whether due or to become due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, founded on contract, tort, or other legal basis, are barred against the estate, the personal representative, and the heirs and devisees of the decedent, unless presented as follows:

(1) a claim based on a contract with the personal representative, within four months after performance by the personal representative is due;

(2) any other claim, within four months after it arises.

(c) Nothing in this section affects or prevents

(1) any proceeding to enforce any mortgage, pledge, or lien upon property of the estate; or

(2) to the limits of the insurance protection only, any proceeding to establish liability of the decedent or the personal representative for which there is protection through liability insurance.

###### Sec. 13.16.465.   Manner of presentation of claims.

Claims against a decedent's estate may be presented as follows:

(1) the claimant may deliver or mail to the personal representative a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed, or may file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the court; the claim is considered presented on receipt of the written statement of claim by the personal representative or on the filing of the claim with the court, whichever occurs first; if a claim is not yet due, the date when it will become due shall be stated; if the claim is contingent or unliquidated, the nature of the uncertainty shall be stated; if the claim is secured, the security shall be described; failure to describe correctly the security, the nature of any uncertainty, and the due date of a claim not yet due does not invalidate the presentation made;

(2) the claimant may commence a proceeding against the personal representative in any court where the personal representative may be subjected to jurisdiction, to obtain payment of a claim against the estate, but the commencement of the proceeding must occur within the time limited for presenting the claim; no presentation of claim is required in regard to matters claimed in proceedings against the decedent that were pending at the time of death;

(3) if a claim is presented under (1) of this section, no proceeding on it may be commenced more than 60 days after the personal representative has mailed a notice of disallowance; but, in the case of a claim that is not presently due or that is contingent or unliquidated, the personal representative may consent to an extension of the 60-day period, or to avoid injustice the court, on petition, may order an extension of the 60-day period, but in no event shall the extension run beyond the applicable statute of limitations.

###### Sec. 13.16.470.   Priority of claim payment and preference.

(a) If the applicable assets of the estate are insufficient to pay all claims in full, the personal representative shall make payment in the following order:

(1) costs and expenses of administration;

(2) reasonable funeral expenses;

(3) debts and taxes with preference under federal law and past due child support payments, except payments required under AS 25.27.120§25.27.130;

(4) reasonable and necessary medical and hospital expenses of the last illness of the decedent, including compensation of persons attending the decedent;

(5) debts and taxes with preference under other laws of this state;

(6) all other claims.

(b) Preference may not be given in the payment of any claim over any other claim of the same class, and a claim due and payable is not entitled to a preference over claims not due.

###### Sec. 13.16.475.   Allowance of claims.

(a) As to claims presented in the manner described in AS 13.16.465 within the time limit prescribed in AS 13.16.460, the personal representative may mail a notice to any claimant stating that the claim has been disallowed. If, after allowing or disallowing a claim, the personal representative changes a decision concerning the claim, the personal representative shall notify the claimant.  The personal representative may not change a disallowance of a claim after the time for the claimant to file a petition for allowance or to commence a proceeding on the claim has run and the claim has been barred.  Every claim that is disallowed in whole or in part by the personal representative is barred so far as not allowed unless the claimant files a petition for allowance in the court or commences a proceeding against the personal representative not later than 60 days after the mailing of the notice of disallowance or partial allowance if the notice warns the claimant of the impending bar.  Failure of the personal representative to mail to a claimant notice of action on a claim for 60 days after the time for original presentation of the claim has expired has the effect of a notice of allowance.

(b) Upon the petition of the personal representative or of a claimant in a proceeding for the purpose, the court may allow in whole or in part any claim or claims presented to the personal representative or filed with the clerk of the court in due time and not barred by (a) of this section.  Notice in this proceeding shall be given to the claimant, the personal representative, and those other persons interested in the estate as the court may direct by order entered at the time the proceeding is commenced.

(c) A judgment in a proceeding in another court against a personal representative to enforce a claim against a decedent's estate is an allowance of the claim.

(d) Unless otherwise provided in any judgment in another court entered against the personal representative, allowed claims bear interest at the legal rate for the period commencing 60 days after the time for original presentation of the claim has expired unless based on a contract making a provision for interest, in which case they bear interest in accordance with that provision.

###### Sec. 13.16.480.   Payment of claims.

(a) Upon the expiration of four months from the date of the first publication of the notice to creditors, the personal representative shall proceed to pay the claims allowed against the estate in the order of priority prescribed, after making provision for homestead, family and support allowances, for claims already presented that have not yet been allowed or whose allowance has been appealed, and for unbarred claims that may yet be presented, including costs and expenses of administration. By petition to the court in a proceeding for the purpose, or by appropriate motion if the administration is supervised, a claimant whose claim has been allowed but not paid as provided herein may secure an order directing the personal representative to pay the claim to the extent that funds of the estate are available for the payment.

(b) The personal representative at any time may pay any just claim that has not been barred, with or without formal presentation, but the personal representative is personally liable to any other claimant whose claim is allowed and who is injured by such payment if

(1) the payment was made before the expiration of the time limit stated in (a) of this section and the personal representative failed to require the payee to give adequate security for the refund of any of the payment necessary to pay other claimants; or

(2) the payment was made, due to the negligence or wilful fault of the personal representative, in such a manner as to deprive the injured claimant of priority.

###### Sec. 13.16.485.   Individual liability of personal representative.

(a) Unless otherwise provided in the contract, a personal representative is not individually liable on a contract properly entered into in a fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the estate unless the personal representative fails to reveal the representative capacity and identify the estate in the contract.

(b) A personal representative is individually liable for obligations arising from ownership or control of the estate or for torts committed in the course of administration of the estate only if personally at fault.

(c) Claims based on contracts entered into by a personal representative in a fiduciary capacity, on obligations arising from ownership or control of the estate, or on torts committed in the course of estate administration may be asserted against the estate by proceeding against the personal representative in the personal representative's fiduciary capacity, whether or not the personal representative is individually liable therefor.

(d) Issues of liability as between the estate and the personal representative individually may be determined in a proceeding for accounting, surcharge, or indemnification or other appropriate proceeding.

###### Sec. 13.16.490.   Secured claims.

Payment of a secured claim is upon the basis of the amount allowed if the creditor surrenders the creditor's security; otherwise payment is upon the basis of one of the following:

(1) if the creditor exhausts the security before receiving payment, unless precluded by other law, upon the amount of the claim allowed less the fair value of the security; or

(2) if the creditor does not have the right to exhaust the security or has not done so, upon the amount of the claim allowed less the value of the security determined by converting it into money according to the terms of the agreement under which the security was delivered to the creditor, or by the creditor and personal representative by agreement, arbitration, compromise, or litigation.

###### Sec. 13.16.495.   Claims not due and contingent or unliquidated claims.

(a) If a claim that will become due at a future time or a contingent or unliquidated claim becomes due or certain before the distribution of the estate, and if the claim has been allowed or established by a proceeding, it is paid in the same manner as presently due and absolute claims of the same class.

(b) In other cases the personal representative or, on petition of the personal representative or the claimant in a special proceeding for the purpose, the court may provide for payment as follows:

(1) if the claimant consents, the claimant may be paid the present or agreed value of the claim, taking any uncertainty into account;

(2) arrangement for future payment, or possible payment, on the happening of the contingency or on liquidation may be made by creating a trust, giving a mortgage, obtaining a bond or security from a distributee, or otherwise.

###### Sec. 13.16.500.   Counterclaims.

In allowing a claim the personal representative may deduct any counterclaim that the estate has against the claimant.  In determining a claim against an estate a court shall reduce the amount allowed by the amount of any counterclaims and, if the counterclaims exceed the claim, render a judgment against the claimant in the amount of the excess.  A counterclaim, liquidated or unliquidated, may arise from a transaction other than that upon which the claim is based. A counterclaim may give rise to relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the claim.

###### Sec. 13.16.505.   Execution and levies prohibited.

No execution may issue upon nor may any levy be made against any property of the estate under any judgment against a decedent or a personal representative, but this section shall not be construed to prevent the enforcement of mortgages, pledges, or liens upon real or personal property in an appropriate proceeding.

###### Sec. 13.16.510.   Compromise of claims.

When a claim against the estate has been presented in any manner, the personal representative may, if it appears for the best interest of the estate, compromise the claim, whether due or not due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated.

###### Sec. 13.16.515.   Encumbered assets.

If any assets of the estate are encumbered by mortgage, pledge, lien, or other security interest, the personal representative may pay the encumbrance or any part of it, renew or extend any obligation secured by the encumbrance, or convey or transfer the assets to the creditor in satisfaction of a lien, in whole or in part, whether or not the holder of the encumbrance has presented a claim, if it appears to be for the best interest of the estate. Payment of an encumbrance does not increase the share of the distributee entitled to the encumbered assets unless the distributee is entitled to exoneration.

###### Sec. 13.16.520.   Administration in more than one state; duty of personal representative.

(a) All assets of estates being administered in this state are subject to all claims, allowances, and charges existing or established against the personal representative wherever appointed.

(b) If the estate either in this state or as a whole is insufficient to cover all family exemptions and allowances determined by the law of the decedent's domicile, prior charges, and claims, after satisfaction of the exemptions, allowances, and charges, each claimant whose claim has been allowed either in the state or elsewhere in administrations of which the personal representative is aware, is entitled to receive payment of an equal proportion of each claim.  If a preference or security in regard to a claim is allowed in another jurisdiction but not in this state, the creditor so benefited is to receive dividends from local assets only upon the balance of the claim after deducting the amount of the benefit.

(c) If the family exemptions and allowances, prior charges, and claims of the entire estate exceed the total value of the portions of the estate being administered separately and this state is not the state of the decedent's last domicile, the claims allowed in this state shall be paid their proportion if local assets are adequate for the purpose, and the balance of local assets shall be transferred to the domiciliary personal representative.  If local assets are not sufficient to pay all claims allowed in this state the amount to which they are entitled, local assets shall be marshalled so that each claim allowed in this state is paid its proportion as far as possible, after taking into account all dividends on claims allowed in this state from assets in other jurisdictions.

###### Sec. 13.16.525.   Final distribution to domiciliary representative.

The estate of a nonresident decedent being administered by a personal representative appointed in this state shall, if there is a personal representative of the decedent's domicile willing to receive it, be distributed to the domiciliary personal representative for the benefit of the successors of the decedent unless (1) by virtue of the decedent's will, if any, and applicable choice of law rules, the successors are identified under the local law of this state without reference to the local law of the decedent's domicile; (2) the personal representative of this state, after reasonable inquiry, is unaware of the existence or identity of a domiciliary personal representative; or (3) the court orders otherwise in a proceeding for a closing order under AS 13.16.620 or incident to the closing of a supervised administration.  In other cases, distribution of the estate of a decedent shall be made in accordance with AS 13.16.005§13.16.400 and 13.16.535§13.16.695.

###### Sec. 13.16.530.   Application to trustees.

Notwithstanding AS 13.16.450§13.16.525, the trustee of a trust may, under AS 13.36.368(b)(3), take the action a personal representative may take under AS 13.16.450§13.16.525.

#### Article 9. Special Provisions Relating to Distribution.

###### Sec. 13.16.535.   Successors' rights if no administration.

In the absence of administration, the heirs and devisees are entitled to the estate in accordance with the terms of a probated will or the laws of intestate succession.  Devisees may establish title by the probated will to devised property. Persons entitled to property by homestead allowance, exemption, or intestacy may establish title to it by proof of the decedent's ownership, death, and their relationship to the decedent.  Successors take subject to all charges incident to administration, including the claims of creditors and allowances of surviving spouse and dependent children, and subject to the rights of others resulting from abatement, retainer, advancement, and ademption.

###### Sec. 13.16.540.   Distribution; order in which assets appropriated; abatement.

(a) Except as provided in (b) of this section and except as provided in connection with the share of the surviving spouse who elects to take an elective share, shares of distributees abate, without any preference or priority as between real and personal property, in the following order: (1) property not disposed of by the will; (2) residuary devises; (3) general devises; (4) specific devises.  For purposes of abatement, a general devise charged on any specific property or fund is a specific devise to the extent of the value of the property on which it is charged, and upon the failure or insufficiency of the property on which it is charged, a general devise to the extent of the failure or insufficiency.  Abatement within each classification is in proportion to the amounts of property each of the beneficiaries would have received if full distribution of the property had been made in accordance with the terms of the will.

(b) If the will expresses an order of abatement, or if the testamentary plan or the express or implied purpose of the devise would be defeated by the order of abatement stated in (a) of this section, the shares of the distributees abate as may be found necessary to give effect to the intention of the testator.

(c) If the subject of a preferred devise is sold or used incident to administration, abatement shall be achieved by appropriate adjustments in, or contribution from, other interests in the remaining assets.

###### Sec. 13.16.545.   Right of retainer.

The amount of a noncontingent indebtedness of a successor to the estate if due, or its present value if not due, shall be offset against the successor's interest; but the successor has the benefit of any defense that would be available to the successor in a direct proceeding for recovery of the debt.

###### Sec. 13.16.550.   Interest on general pecuniary devise. [Repealed,§4 ch 145 SLA 2003.]

###### Sec. 13.16.555.   Penalty clause for contest.

A provision in a will purporting to penalize any interested person for contesting the will or instituting other proceedings relating to the estate is unenforceable if probable cause exists for instituting proceedings.

###### Sec. 13.16.560.   Distribution in kind; valuation; method.

(a) Unless a contrary intention is indicated by the will, the distributable assets of a decedent's estate shall be distributed in kind to the extent possible through application of the following provisions:

(1) a specific devisee is entitled to distribution of the thing devised, and a spouse or child who has selected particular assets of an estate as provided in AS 13.12.402§13.12.405 shall receive the items selected;

(2) a homestead or family allowance or devise payable in money may be satisfied by value in kind if

(A) the person entitled to the payment has not demanded payment in cash;

(B) the property distributed in kind is valued at fair market value as of the date of its distribution; and

(C) no residuary devisee has requested that the asset in question remain a part of the residue of the estate;

(3) for the purpose of valuation under (2) of this subsection, securities regularly traded on recognized exchanges, if distributed in kind, are valued at the price for the last sale of like securities traded on the business day before distribution or, if there was no sale on that day, at the median between amounts bid and offered at the close of that day; assets consisting of sums owed the decedent or the estate by solvent debtors as to which there is no known dispute or defense are valued at the sum due with accrued interest or discounted to the date of distribution; for assets that do not have readily ascertainable values, a valuation as of a date not more than 30 days before the date of distribution, if otherwise reasonable, controls; for purposes of facilitating distribution, the personal representative may ascertain the value of the assets as of the time of the proposed distribution in any reasonable way, including the employment of qualified appraisers, even if the assets may have been previously appraised;

(4) the residuary estate shall be distributed in any equitable manner, including distribution in kind, in cash, partially in kind, partially in cash, in divided interests, in undivided interests, pro rata among all the distributees, or by a method other than pro rata among all distributees; distribution under this paragraph may be made without regard to the income tax basis or other special tax attributes of the assets; a distribution under this paragraph may be made in whatever manner the personal representative finds to be the most practicable and in the best interests of the distributees.

(b) After the probable charges against the estate are known, the personal representative may mail or deliver a proposal for distribution to all persons who have a right to object to the proposed distribution.  The right of any distributee to object to the proposed distribution on the basis of the kind or value of asset to be received by the distributee, if not waived earlier in writing, terminates if the distributee fails to object in writing received by the personal representative within 30 days after mailing or delivery of the proposal.

###### Sec. 13.16.565.   Distribution in kind; evidence.

If distribution in kind is made, the personal representative shall execute an instrument or deed of distribution assigning, transferring, or releasing the assets to the distributee as evidence of the distributee's title to the property.

###### Sec. 13.16.570.   Distribution; right or title of distributee.

Proof that a distributee has received an instrument or deed of distribution of assets in kind, or payment in distribution, from a personal representative, is conclusive evidence that the distributee has succeeded to the interest of the estate in the distributed assets, as against all persons interested in the estate, except that the personal representative may recover the assets or their value if the distribution was improper.

###### Sec. 13.16.575.   Improper distribution; liability of distributee.

Unless the distribution or payment no longer can be questioned because of adjudication, estoppel, or limitation, a distributee of property improperly distributed or paid, or a claimant who was improperly paid, is liable to return the property improperly received and its income since distribution if the distributee or claimant has the property.  If the distributee or claimant does not have the property, then the distributee or claimant is liable to return the value as of the date of disposition of the property improperly received and its income and gain.

###### Sec. 13.16.580.   Purchasers from distributees protected.

If property distributed in kind or a security interest in it is acquired for value by a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who has received an instrument or deed of distribution from the personal representative, the purchaser or lender takes title free of rights of any interested person in the estate and incurs no personal liability to the estate, or to any interested person, whether or not the distribution was proper or supported by court order and whether or not the authority of the personal representative was terminated before execution of the instrument or deed. This section protects a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who, as personal representative, executed the deed of distribution, as well as a purchaser from or lender to any other distributee or transferee of a distributee. To be protected under this provision, a purchaser or lender need not inquire whether a personal representative acted properly in making the distribution in kind, even if the personal representative and the distributee are the same person, or whether the authority of the personal representative had terminated before the distribution. Any instrument described in this section that is recorded under AS 40.17 or filed under former AS 45.09 or under AS 45.29 and that bears a notation of that recordation or filing is prima facie evidence that the transfer described in it was made for value.

###### Sec. 13.16.585.   Partition for purpose of distribution.

When two or more heirs or devisees are entitled to distribution of undivided interests in any real or personal property of the estate, the personal representative or one or more of the heirs or devisees may petition the court before the formal or informal closing of the estate, to make partition.  After notice to the interested heirs or devisees, the court shall partition the property in the same manner as provided by the law for civil actions of partition.  The court may direct the personal representative to sell any property that cannot be partitioned without prejudice to the owners and that cannot conveniently be allotted to any one party.

###### Sec. 13.16.590.   Private agreements among successors to decedent binding on personal representative.

Subject to the rights of creditors and taxing authorities, competent successors may agree among themselves to alter the interests, shares, or amounts to which they are entitled under the will of the decedent, or under the laws of intestacy, in any way that they provide in a written contract executed by all who are affected by its provisions.  The personal representative shall abide by the terms of the agreement subject to the obligation to administer the estate for the benefit of creditors, to pay all taxes and costs of administration, and to carry out the responsibilities of office for the benefit of any successors of the decedent who are not parties.  Personal representatives of decedents' estates are not required to see to the performance of trusts if the trustee thereof is another person who is willing to accept the trust. Accordingly, trustees of a testamentary trust are successors for the purposes of this section. Nothing in this section relieves trustees of any duties owed to beneficiaries of trusts.

###### Sec. 13.16.595.   Distributions to trustee.

(a) Before distributing to a trustee, the personal representative may require that the trust be registered if the state in which it is to be administered provides for registration and that the trustee inform the beneficiaries as provided in AS 13.36.080.

(b) If the trust instrument does not excuse the trustee from giving bond, the personal representative may petition the appropriate court to require that the trustee post bond if the personal representative apprehends that distribution might jeopardize the interests of persons who are not able to protect themselves, and the personal representative may withhold distribution until the court has acted.

(c) No inference of negligence on the part of the personal representative shall be drawn from failure to exercise the authority conferred by (a) and (b) of this section.

###### Sec. 13.16.600.   Disposition of unclaimed assets.

(a) If an heir, devisee, or claimant cannot be found, the personal representative shall distribute the share of personal property of the missing person to the person's conservator, or if the person has no conservator to the Department of Revenue to be deposited in the general fund as required by AS 34.45.370. Property distributable to the Department of Revenue under this subsection is subject to AS 34.45.280§34.45.780.  If notice to the heir, devisee, or claimant, substantially equivalent to that required by AS 34.45.310, has been given by the personal representative or other person, AS 34.45.310 does not apply.

(b) Real property distributable to a missing heir, devisee, or claimant shall be distributed first to the conservator of the heir, devisee, or claimant; if the heir, devisee, or claimant has no conservator, the real property passes to the state. Real property reported under this subsection is subject to AS 38.95.200§38.95.270.

###### Sec. 13.16.605.   Distribution to person under disability.

A personal representative may discharge the obligation to distribute to any person under legal disability by distributing to the person's conservator, or any other person authorized by AS 13.06 § AS 13.36 or otherwise to give a valid receipt and discharge for the distribution.

###### Sec. 13.16.610.   Apportionment of estate taxes.

(a) Unless the will provides otherwise, the tax shall be apportioned among all persons interested in the estate. The apportionment is to be made in the proportion that the value of the interest of each person interested in the estate bears to the total value of the interests of all persons interested in the estate.  The values used in determining the tax are to be used for that purpose.  If the decedent's will directs a method of apportionment of tax different from the method described in AS 13.06 § AS 13.36, the method described in the will controls.

(b) The court in which venue lies for the administration of the estate of a decedent, on petition for the purpose, may determine the apportionment of the tax.

(c) If the court finds that it is inequitable to apportion interest and penalties in the manner provided in (a) of this section, because of special circumstances, it may direct apportionment of them in the manner it finds equitable.

(d) If the court finds that the assessment of penalties and interest assessed in relation to the tax is due to delay caused by the negligence of the fiduciary, the court may charge the fiduciary with the amount of the assessed penalties and interest.

(e) In any action to recover from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person in accordance with AS 13.06 § AS 13.36, the determination of the court in respect thereto shall be prima facie correct.

(f) The personal representative or other person in possession of the property of the decedent required to pay the tax may withhold from any property distributable to any person interested in the estate, upon its distribution, the amount of tax attributable to the distributee's interest. If the property in possession of the personal representative or other person required to pay the tax and distributable to any person interested in the estate is insufficient to satisfy the proportionate amount of the tax determined to be due from the person, the personal representative or other person required to pay the tax may recover the deficiency from the person interested in the estate.  If the property is not in the possession of the personal representative or the other person required to pay the tax, the personal representative or the other person required to pay the tax may recover from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person in accordance with this chapter.

(g) If property held by the personal representative is distributed before final apportionment of the tax, the distributee shall provide a bond or other security for the apportionment liability in the form and amount prescribed by the personal representative.

(h) In making an apportionment, allowances shall be made for any exemptions granted, for any classification made of persons interested in the estate, and for any deductions and credits allowed by the law imposing the tax.

(i) Any exemption or deduction allowed by reason of the relationship of any person to the decedent or by reason of the purposes of the gift inures to the benefit of the person bearing the relationship or receiving the gift; but if an interest is subject to a prior present interest that is not allowable as a deduction, the tax apportionable against the present interest shall be paid from principal.

(j) Any deduction for property previously taxed and any credit for gift taxes or death taxes of a foreign country paid by the decedent or the decedent's estate inures to the proportionate benefit of all persons liable to apportionment.

(k) Any credit for inheritance, succession, or estate taxes, or taxes in the nature thereof applicable to property or interests includable in the estate, inures to the benefit of the persons or interests chargeable with the payment thereof to the extent proportionately that the credit reduces the tax.

(l) To the extent that property passing to or in trust for a surviving spouse or any charitable, public, or similar gift or devisee is not an allowable deduction for purposes of the tax solely by reason of an inheritance tax or other death tax imposed upon and deductible from the property, the property is not included in the computation provided for in (a) of this section, and to that extent no apportionment is made against the property. This subsection does not apply to any case if the result would be to deprive the estate of a deduction otherwise allowable under Section 2053(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, of the United States, relating to deduction for state death taxes on transfers for public, charitable, or religious uses.

(m) No interest in income and no estate for years or for life or other temporary interest in any property or fund is subject to apportionment as between the temporary interest and the remainder.  The tax on the temporary interest and the tax, if any, on the remainder is chargeable against the corpus of the property or funds subject to the temporary interest and remainder.

(n) Neither the personal representative nor other person required to pay the tax is under any duty to institute any action to recover from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person until the expiration of the three months next following final determination of the tax.  A personal representative or other person required to pay the tax who institutes the action within a reasonable time after the three-month period is not subject to any liability or surcharge because any portion of the tax apportioned to any person interested in the estate was collectable at a time following the death of the decedent but thereafter became uncollectable.  If the personal representative or other person required to pay the tax cannot collect from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person, the amount not recoverable shall be equitably apportioned among the other persons interested in the estate who are subject to apportionment.

(o) A personal representative acting in another state or a person required to pay the tax domiciled in another state may institute an action in the courts of this state and may recover a proportionate amount of the federal estate tax, of an estate tax payable to another state or of a death duty due by a decedent's estate to another state, from a person interested in the estate who is either domiciled in this state or who owns property in this state subject to attachment or execution.  For the purposes of the action the determination of apportionment by the court having jurisdiction of the administration of the decedent's estate in the other state is prima facie correct.

(p) In this section,

(1) "estate" means the gross estate of a decedent as determined for the purpose of federal estate tax and the estate tax payable to this state;

(2) "fiduciary" means personal representative or trustee;

(3) "person" means any individual, partnership, association, joint stock company, corporation, government, political subdivision, governmental agency, or local governmental agency;

(4) "person interested in the estate" means any person entitled to receive, or who has received, from a decedent or by reason of the death of a decedent any property or interest in the property included in the decedent's estate; it includes a personal representative, conservator, and trustee;

(5) "state" means any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;

(6) "tax" means the federal estate tax and the additional inheritance tax imposed by AS 43.31 and interest and penalties imposed in addition to the tax.

#### Article 10. Closing Estates.

###### Sec. 13.16.620.   Formal proceedings terminating administration; testate or intestate; order of general protection.

(a) A personal representative or any interested person may petition for an order of complete settlement of the estate. The personal representative may petition at any time, and any other interested person may petition after one year from the appointment of the original personal representative except that no petition under this section may be entertained until the time for presenting claims that arose before the death of the decedent has expired. The petition may request the court to determine testacy, if not previously determined, to consider the final account or compel or approve an accounting and distribution, to construe any will or determine heirs and adjudicate the final settlement and distribution of the estate.  After notice to all interested persons and hearing the court may enter an order or orders, on appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the estate, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement and directing or approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative from further claim or demand of any interested person.

(b) If one or more heirs or devisees were omitted as parties in, or were not given notice of, a previous formal testacy proceeding, the court, on proper petition for an order of complete settlement of the estate under this section, and after notice to the omitted or unnotified persons and other interested parties determined to be interested on the assumption that the previous order concerning testacy is conclusive as to those given notice of the earlier proceeding, may determine testacy as it affects the omitted persons and confirm or alter the previous order of testacy as it affects all interested persons as appropriate in the light of the new proofs.  In the absence of objection by an omitted or unnotified person, evidence received in the original testacy proceeding constitutes prima facie proof of due execution of any will previously admitted to probate, or of the fact that the decedent left no valid will if the prior proceedings determined this fact.

###### Sec. 13.16.625.   Formal proceedings terminating testate administration; order construing will without adjudicating testacy.

A personal representative administering an estate under an informally probated will or any devisee under an informally probated will may petition for an order of settlement of the estate that will not adjudicate the testacy status of the decedent.  The personal representative may petition at any time, and a devisee may petition after one year, from the appointment of the original personal representative, except that no petition under this section may be entertained until the time for presenting claims that arose before the death of the decedent has expired. The petition may request the court to consider the final account or compel or approve an accounting and distribution, to construe the will and adjudicate final settlement and distribution of the estate. After notice to all devisees and the personal representative and hearing, the court may enter an order or orders, on appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the estate under the will, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement and directing or approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative from further claim or demand of any devisee who is a party to the proceeding and those the devisee represents.  If it appears that a part of the estate is intestate, the proceedings shall be dismissed or amendments made to meet the provisions of AS 13.16.620.

###### Sec. 13.16.630.   Closing estates; by sworn statement of personal representative.

(a) Unless prohibited by order of the court and except for estates being administered in supervised administration proceedings, a personal representative may close an estate by filing with the court no earlier than six months after the date of original appointment of a general personal representative for the estate, a verified statement stating that the personal representative, or a prior personal representative, has

(1) published notice to creditors as provided by AS 13.16.450 and that the first publication occurred more than six months before the date of the statement;

(2) fully administered the estate of the decedent by making payment, settlement, or other disposition of all claims that were presented, expenses of administration and estate, inheritance, and other death taxes, except as specified in the statement, and that the assets of the estate have been distributed to the persons entitled; if any claims remain undischarged, the statement must state whether the personal representative has distributed the estate subject to possible liability with the agreement of the distributees or it must state in detail other arrangements that have been made to accommodate outstanding liabilities; and

(3) sent a copy of it to all distributees of the estate and to all creditors or other claimants of whom the personal representative is aware whose claims are neither paid nor barred and has furnished a full account in writing of the administration to the distributees whose interests are affected by it.

(b) If no proceedings involving the personal representative are pending in the court one year after the closing statement is filed, the appointment of the personal representative terminates.

###### Sec. 13.16.635.   Liability of distributees to claimants.

After assets of an estate have been distributed and subject to AS 13.16.645, an undischarged claim not barred may be prosecuted in a proceeding against one or more distributees. A distributee is not liable to claimants for amounts received as exempt property, homestead or family allowances, or for amounts in excess of the value of a distribution as of the time of distribution.  As between distributees, each shall bear the cost of satisfaction of unbarred claims as if the claim had been satisfied in the course of administration.  Any distributee who fails to notify other distributees of the demand made upon the distributee by the claimant in sufficient time to permit them to join in any proceeding in which the claim was asserted against the distributee loses the right of contribution against other distributees.

###### Sec. 13.16.640.   Limitations on proceedings against personal representative.

Unless previously barred by adjudication and except as provided in the closing statement, the rights of successors and of creditors whose claims have not otherwise been barred against the personal representative for breach of fiduciary duty are barred unless a proceeding to assert them is commenced within six months after the filing of the closing statement.  The rights thus barred do not include rights to recover from a personal representative for fraud, misrepresentation, or inadequate disclosure related to the settlement of the decedent's estate.

###### Sec. 13.16.645.   Limitations on actions and proceedings against distributees.

Unless previously adjudicated in a formal testacy proceeding or in a proceeding settling the accounts of a personal representative or otherwise barred, the claim of any claimant to recover from a distributee who is liable to pay the claim, and the right of any heir or devisee, or of a successor personal representative acting in their behalf, to recover property improperly distributed or the value of it from any distributee is forever barred at the later of (1) three years after the decedent's death; or (2) one year after the time of distribution of it.  This section does not bar an action to recover property or value received as the result of fraud.

###### Sec. 13.16.650.   Certificate discharging liens securing fiduciary performance.

After the appointment has terminated, the personal representative, the sureties of the personal representative, or any successor of either, upon the filing of a verified application showing, so far as is known by the applicant, that no action concerning the estate is pending in any court, is entitled to receive a certificate from the registrar that the personal representative appears to have fully administered the estate in question.  The certificate evidences discharge of any lien on any property given to secure the obligation of the personal representative in lieu of bond or any surety, but does not preclude action against the personal representative or the surety.

###### Sec. 13.16.655.   Subsequent administration.

If other property of the estate is discovered after an estate has been settled and the personal representative discharged or after one year after a closing statement has been filed, the court upon petition of any interested person and upon notice as it directs may appoint the same or a successor personal representative to administer the subsequently discovered estate.  If a new appointment is made, unless the court orders otherwise, the provisions of AS 13.06 §AS 13.36 apply as appropriate; but no claim previously barred may be asserted in the subsequent administration.

#### Article 11. Compromise of Controversies.

###### Sec. 13.16.665.   Effect of approval of agreements.

A compromise of any controversy as to admission to probate of any instrument offered for formal probate as the will of a decedent, the construction, validity, or effect of any governing instrument, the rights or interests in the estate of the decedent, of any successor, or the administration of the estate, if approved in a formal proceeding in the court for that purpose, is binding on all the parties to the compromise including those unborn, unascertained or who could not be located. An approved compromise is binding even though it may affect a trust or an inalienable interest. A compromise does not impair the rights of creditors or of taxing authorities who are not parties to it.

###### Sec. 13.16.670.   Procedure for securing court approval of compromise.

The procedure for securing court approval of a compromise is as follows:

(1) the terms of the compromise shall be set out in an agreement in writing that shall be executed by all competent persons and parents acting for any minor child having beneficial interests or having claims that will or may be affected by the compromise; execution is not required by any person whose identity cannot be ascertained or whose whereabouts is unknown and cannot reasonably be ascertained;

(2) an interested person, including the personal representative, if any, or a trustee, then may submit the agreement to the court for its approval and for execution by the personal representative, the trustee of every affected testamentary trust, and other fiduciaries and representatives;

(3) after notice to all interested persons or their representatives, including the personal representative of any estate and all affected trustees of trusts, the court, if it finds that the contest or controversy is in good faith and that the effect of the agreement upon the interests of persons represented by fiduciaries or other representatives is just and reasonable, shall make an order approving the agreement and directing all fiduciaries under its supervision to execute the agreement; minor children represented only by their parents may be bound only if their parents join with other competent persons in execution of the compromise; upon the making of the order and the execution of the agreement, all further disposition of the estate is in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

#### Article 12. Collection of Personal Property by Affidavit and Summary Administration Procedure.

###### Sec. 13.16.680.   Collection of personal property by affidavit.

(a) Thirty days after the death of a decedent, any person indebted to the decedent or having possession of tangible personal property or an instrument evidencing a debt, obligation, stock, or chose in action belonging to the decedent shall make payment of the indebtedness or deliver the tangible personal property or an instrument evidencing a debt, obligation, stock, or chose in action to a person claiming to be the successor of the decedent upon being presented an affidavit made by or on behalf of the successor stating that

(1) the entire estate, wherever located, less liens and encumbrances, consists only of not more than

(A) vehicles subject to registration under AS 28.10.011 with a total value that does not exceed $100,000; and

(B) personal property, other than vehicles described in (A) of this paragraph, that does not exceed $50,000;

(2) 30 days have elapsed since the death of the decedent;

(3) no application or petition for the appointment of a personal representative is pending or has been granted in any jurisdiction; and

If any person to whom an affidavit is delivered refuses to pay, deliver, transfer, or issue any personal property or evidence of it, it may be recovered or its payment, delivery, transfer, or issuance compelled upon proof of their right in a proceeding brought for the purpose by or on behalf of the persons entitled to it.  Any person to whom payment, delivery, transfer, or issuance is made is answerable and accountable for it to any personal representative of the estate or to any other person having a superior right.

###### Sec. 13.16.690.   Small estates; summary administrative procedure.

If it appears from the inventory and appraisal that the value of the entire estate, less liens and encumbrances, does not exceed homestead allowance, exempt property, family allowance, costs and expenses of administration, reasonable funeral expenses, and reasonable and necessary medical and hospital expenses of the last illness of the decedent, the personal representative, without giving notice to creditors, may immediately disburse and distribute the estate to the persons entitled to it and file a closing statement as provided in AS 13.16.695.

###### Sec. 13.16.695.   Small estates; closing by sworn statement of personal representative.

(a) Unless prohibited by order of the court and except for estates being administered by supervised personal representatives, a personal representative may close an estate administered under the summary procedures of AS 13.16.690 by filing with the court, at any time after disbursement and distribution of the estate, a verified statement stating that

(1) to the best knowledge of the personal representative, the value of the entire estate, less liens and encumbrances, did not exceed homestead allowance, exempt property, family allowance, costs and expenses of administration, reasonable funeral expenses, and reasonable, necessary medical and hospital expenses of the last illness of the decedent;

(2) the personal representative has fully administered the estate by disbursing and distributing it to the persons entitled to it; and

(3) the personal representative has sent a copy of the closing statement to all distributees of the estate and to all creditors or other claimants of whom the personal representative is aware whose claims are neither paid nor barred and has furnished a full account in writing of the administration to the distributees whose interests are affected.

(b) If no action or proceeding involving the personal representative is pending in the court one year after the closing statement is filed, the appointment of the personal representative terminates.

When a judge receives information that a person has died in the judge's judicial district leaving an estate with property limited to the property described under AS 13.16.680(a)(1) or less and no qualified person has appeared to take charge of the assets, the judge may immediately appoint a person, corporation, or attorney to settle the estate in the manner provided for in AS 13.16.680§13.16.695.

###### Sec. 13.16.705.   Inheritance of Native corporation stock.

(a) The settlement common stock or other inalienable stock in a corporation organized under the laws of Alaska under 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. (Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act) is not subject to probate nor shall its value be considered in determining the value of an estate or allowance under this title. Upon death of the holder, if the stock does not pass by the testamentary disposition clause on the stock certificate or by the form authorized under (b) of this section, properly executed, it passes by will or intestate succession. In such a case, the determination of the person entitled to the stock shall be made by the corporation that initially issued the stock or its designated agent. The determination shall be made on the basis of an affidavit, furnished to the corporation that initially issued the stock, or its agent, showing the right of the person entitled to the stock to receive it. The affidavit, accepted in good faith by the corporation or its agent, has the same effect as an affidavit under AS 13.16.685, and the person entitled to the stock, if the affidavit is not accepted, has the remedy set out in AS 13.16.685. In case of dispute as to the person entitled to receive the stock, a person claiming ownership may bring an independent action in the superior court.

(b) Unless a separate form is provided that substantially satisfies the requirements of this subsection and that is distributed to the same extent as the certificate, each certificate representing the stock shall bear provisions, on its reverse side, containing blanks to be filled in by the owner, constituting a last will and testament for the purposes of this section and 43 U.S.C. 1606(h) insofar as the shares represented by that certificate are concerned. The clause may be signed by the owner, dated, and notarized. This testamentary disposition may be changed from time to time or revoked, and it governs unless there is a subsequently executed certificate, form, or formal will making specific disposition of the stock.

(c) When ownership of stock passes by devise or inheritance or as a result of court action, the stock shall be partitioned, insofar as practicable, in whole shares among those entitled to them.

(d) If a deceased shareholder has failed to dispose of the stock by will and has no heirs under the applicable laws of intestacy, the shares escheat to the corporation.

(e) The situs of the stock is Alaska.

(f) This section applies to stock as long as the stock remains inalienable.

(g) Where appropriate, terms used in this section have the meanings given in AS 13.06.050. In this section, "stock" means the settlement common stock or other inalienable stock of a corporation organized under the laws of the state under 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. (Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act), and includes membership in a corporation organized under AS 10.20 and inchoate rights to stock.

###### Sec. 13.26.121.   Testamentary appointment of guardian of minor.

The parent of a minor may appoint by will a guardian of an unmarried minor.  Subject to the right of the minor under AS 13.26.126, a testamentary appointment becomes effective upon filing the guardian's acceptance in the court in which the will is probated, if before acceptance, both parents are dead or the surviving parent is adjudged incapacitated. If both parents are dead, an effective appointment by the parent who died later has priority.  This state recognizes a testamentary appointment effected by filing the guardian's acceptance under a will probated in another state which is the testator's domicile.  Upon acceptance of appointment, written notice of acceptance must be given by the guardian to the minor and to the person having care of the minor, or to the minor's nearest adult relation.

An objection may be withdrawn.  An objection does not preclude appointment by the court in a proper proceeding of the testamentary nominee, or any other suitable person.

The court may appoint a guardian for an unmarried minor if all parental rights of custody have been terminated or suspended by circumstances or prior court order.  A guardian appointed by will as provided in AS 13.26.121 whose appointment has not been prevented or nullified under AS 13.26.126 has priority over any guardian who may be appointed by the court but the court may proceed with an appointment upon a finding that the testamentary guardian has failed to accept the testamentary appointment within 30 days after notice of the guardianship proceeding.

A guardian of a minor has the powers and responsibilities of a parent who has not been deprived of custody of a minor and unemancipated child, except that a guardian is not legally obligated to provide from the guardian's own funds for the ward and is not liable to third persons by reason of the parental relationship for acts of the ward.  In particular, and without qualifying the foregoing, a guardian

(1) must take reasonable care of the ward's personal effects and commence protective proceedings if necessary to protect other property of the ward;

(2) may receive money payable for the support of the ward to the ward's parent, guardian or custodian under the terms of any statutory benefit or insurance system, or any private contract, devise, trust, conservatorship or custodianship; the guardian also may receive money or property of the ward paid or delivered by virtue of AS 13.26.031; any sums so received shall be applied to the ward's current needs for support, care and education; the guardian must exercise due care to conserve any excess for the ward's future needs unless a conservator has been appointed for the estate of the ward, in which case excess shall be paid over at least annually to the conservator; sums so received by the guardian may not be used for compensation for the guardian's services except as approved by order of court or as determined by a duly appointed conservator other than the guardian; a guardian may institute proceedings to compel the performance by any person of a duty to support the ward or to pay sums for the welfare of the ward;

A guardian's authority and responsibility terminate upon the death, resignation, or removal of the guardian or upon the minor's death, adoption, marriage, or attainment of majority, but termination does not affect the guardian's liability for prior acts, nor the obligation to account for funds and assets of the ward.  Resignation of a guardian does not terminate the guardianship until it has been approved by the court.  A testamentary appointment under an informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding.

#### Article 3. Guardians of Incapacitated Persons.

###### Sec. 13.26.201.   Purpose and basis for guardianship.

Guardianship for an incapacitated person shall be used only as is necessary to promote and protect the well-being of the person, shall be designed to encourage the development of maximum self-reliance and independence of the person, and shall be ordered only to the extent necessitated by the person's actual mental and physical limitations.  An incapacitated person for whom a guardian has been appointed is not presumed to be incompetent and retains all legal and civil rights except those that have been expressly limited by court order or have been specifically granted to the guardian by the court.

###### Secs. 13.26.205 §13.26.210.  [Renumbered as AS 13.26.440§13.26.465.]

###### Sec. 13.26.211   Testamentary appointment of guardian for incapacitated person.

(a) The parent of an incapacitated person may by will appoint a guardian of the incapacitated person.  A testamentary appointment by a parent becomes effective when, after having given seven days' prior written notice of intention to do so to the incapacitated person and to the person having care of the incapacitated person or to the incapacitated person's nearest adult relative, the guardian files acceptance of appointment in the court in which the will is informally or formally probated, if, prior thereto, both parents are dead or the surviving parent is adjudged incapacitated. If both parents are dead, an effective appointment by the parent who died later has priority unless it is terminated by the denial of probate in formal proceedings.

(b) The spouse of a married incapacitated person may by will appoint a guardian of the incapacitated person.  The appointment becomes effective when, after having given seven days' prior written notice of intention to do so to the incapacitated person and to the person having care of the incapacitated person or to the incapacitated person's nearest adult relative, the guardian files acceptance of appointment in the court in which the will is informally or formally probated. An effective appointment by a spouse has priority over an appointment by a parent unless it is terminated by the denial of probate in formal proceedings.

(c) This state recognizes a testamentary appointment effected by filing acceptance under a will probated at the testator's domicile in another state.

(d) On the filing with the court in which the will was probated of written objection to the appointment by the person for whom a testamentary appointment of guardian has been made, the appointment is terminated. An objection does not prevent appointment by the court in a proper proceeding of the testamentary nominee or any other suitable person upon an adjudication of incapacity in proceedings under AS 13.26.216§13.26.316.

(e) A testamentary appointment of a guardian by the parent of an incapacitated person, or by the spouse of a married incapacitated person, may grant all guardianship powers and duties that the deceased parent or spouse held, subject to modification by the court under AS 13.26.286.

(2) includes findings of fact that support each grant of authority to the guardian;

(3) adopts a guardianship plan.

(b) The guardianship plan shall specify the authority that the guardian has with regard to

(1) medical care for the ward's physical condition;

(2) mental health treatment that the guardian considers to be in the ward's best interests;

(3) housing for the ward with consideration of the following:

(A) the wishes of the ward;

(B) the preferability of allowing the ward to retain local community ties; and

(C) the requirement for services to be provided in the least restrictive setting;

(4) personal care, educational and vocational services necessary for the physical and mental welfare of the ward and to return the ward to full capacity;

(7) control of the estate and income of the ward to pay for the cost of services that the guardian is authorized to obtain on behalf of the ward.

(c) The guardianship plan may not be more restrictive of the liberty of the ward than is reasonably necessary to protect the ward from serious physical injury, illness or disease and to provide the ward with medical care and mental health treatment for physical and mental health.  The guardianship plan shall be designed to encourage a ward to participate in all decisions that affect the ward and to act on the ward's own behalf to the maximum extent possible.  The court may not assign a duty or power to a guardian unless the need for it has been proven to the satisfaction of the court and no less restrictive alternative or combination of alternatives is sufficient to satisfy the need.

(d) The duration of the term of guardianship shall be determined by the court order.  Upon receipt of a report or other information that requires further consideration, the court may order a review hearing if it determines that the hearing is in the best interests of the ward.

###### Sec. 13.26.281.   Termination of guardianship for incapacitated person.

(a) The authority and responsibility of a guardian for an incapacitated person terminates upon the death of the guardian or ward, the determination of incapacity of the guardian, the removal or resignation of the guardian as provided in AS 13.26.286, or upon the expiration of the period specified by court order as the duration of the guardianship.  Testamentary appointment under an informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding.

(a) On petition of the ward, the guardian, or any person interested in the ward's welfare, or on the court's own motion, the court may (1) review and amend a decision of a guardian; or (2) if alternatives that are less restrictive than guardianship or less restrictive than the existing guardianship plan would assist the ward in meeting essential requirements for physical health and safety, modify the provisions of its order to (A) amend the guardianship plan or the responsibilities of the guardian; (B) remove a guardian and appoint a successor; or (C) terminate the guardianship. On petition of the guardian, the court may accept a resignation and make any other order that may be appropriate.

(b) The ward, the guardian, or any person interested in the ward's welfare may petition for an order that the ward is no longer incapacitated or no longer incapacitated to the same extent as the ward was when the original guardianship order was made or when the court last amended the guardianship order, and for removal or resignation of the guardian, termination of the guardianship, or a change in the responsibilities of the guardian.

(c) Before removing a guardian, changing the guardian's responsibilities, accepting the resignation of a guardian, or ordering that a ward's guardianship be changed or terminated, the court, following the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the ward as apply to a petition for appointment of a guardian and applying the least restrictive alternative necessary to meet the needs of the ward after consideration of alternatives to guardianship services, may send a visitor to the residence of the present guardian and to the place where the ward resides or is detained, to observe conditions and report in writing to the court.

(d) If at any time the ward requests or indicates to the guardian or to the agency responsible for the ward's care or its employee that the ward desires a change in guardianship, the guardian or the agency providing care shall inform the court of the request or indication.

(e) If the guardian dies, or if on the basis of a petition filed under this section or a report or other information, there is probable cause to believe a guardian is not performing the guardian's responsibilities effectively and there is an imminent danger that the physical health or safety of the ward will be seriously impaired, the court shall take whatever action is necessary to protect the ward, including the dismissal of the guardian and appointment of a temporary guardian without a hearing.

(a) If during the pendency of an initial petition for guardianship it appears that the respondent is in need of immediate services to protect the respondent against serious injury, illness, or disease and the respondent is not capable of procuring the necessary services, the petitioner may request the appointment of a temporary guardian to authorize the services.  The request shall state the reasons and factual basis for the request.

(f) If no guardianship petition is pending but the court is informed of a person who is apparently incapacitated and in need of emergency life-saving services, the court may authorize the services upon determining that delay until a guardianship hearing can be held would entail a life-threatening risk to the person.

###### Sec. 13.26.305.   [Renumbered as AS 13.26.565.]

###### Sec. 13.26.306.   Emergency powers.

(a) The court may appoint a competent person, including a private professional guardian, or the public guardian, as the guardian of an incapacitated person.

(b) The court may not appoint a person to be a guardian of an incapacitated person if the person

(1) provides, or is likely to provide during the guardianship period, substantial services to the incapacitated person in a professional or business capacity, other than in the capacity as guardian;

(2) is, or is likely to become during the guardianship period, a creditor of the incapacitated person, other than in the capacity as guardian;

(3) has, or is likely to have during the guardianship period, interests that may conflict with those of the incapacitated person; or

(4) is employed by a person who would be disqualified under (1)§(3) of this subsection.

(c) A person may be appointed as the guardian of an incapacitated person notwithstanding the provisions of (b) of this section if the person is the spouse, adult child, parent, or sibling of the incapacitated person and the court determines that the potential conflict of interest is insubstantial and that the appointment would clearly be in the best interests of the incapacitated person. When appointing a relative or friend of the incapacitated person as the guardian of an incapacitated person, the court shall require that the proposed guardian complete one hour of mandatory education on the basics of guardianship before the appointment or within 30 days after the appointment.

(d) Subject to (e) and (f) of this section, qualified persons have priority for appointment as guardian in the following order:

(1) an individual or organization nominated by the incapacitated person if, at the time of the nomination, the incapacitated person had, in the opinion of the court, sufficient mental capacity to make an informed choice;

(2) the spouse of the incapacitated person;

(3) an adult child or parent of the incapacitated person;

(4) a relative of the incapacitated person with whom the incapacitated person has resided for more than six months during the year before the filing of the petition;

(5) a relative or friend who has demonstrated a sincere, longstanding interest in the welfare of the incapacitated person;

(6) a private professional guardian;

(7) the public guardian.

(e) When more than one person has equal priority under (d) of this section, the court shall select the person it considers to be the best qualified.

(f) When in the best interest of the incapacitated person, a court may decline to appoint a person who has priority under (d) of this section as guardian of an incapacitated person and may appoint as guardian a person who has a lower priority than another person or who does not have a priority. If the court appoints a person with a lower priority under (d) of this section than another person, the court shall make appropriate written findings related to why the best interests of the respondent require appointment of the person with a lower priority.

###### Sec. 13.26.315.   [Renumbered as AS 13.26.575.]

###### Sec. 13.26.316.   General powers and duties of guardian.

(a) A guardian shall diligently and in good faith carry out the specific duties and powers assigned by the court.  In carrying out duties and powers, the guardian shall encourage the ward to participate to the maximum extent of the ward's capacity in all decisions that affect the ward, to act on the ward's own behalf in all matters in which the ward is able, and to develop or regain, to the maximum extent possible, the capacity to meet the essential requirements for physical health or safety, to protect the ward's rights, and to manage the ward's financial resources.

(b) A partial guardian of an incapacitated person has only the powers and duties respecting the ward enumerated in the court order.

(c) A full guardian of an incapacitated person has the same powers and duties respecting the ward that a parent has respecting an unemancipated minor child except that the guardian is not liable for the care and maintenance of the ward and is not liable, solely by reason of the guardianship, to a person who is harmed by acts of the ward. Except as modified by order of the court, a full guardian's powers and duties include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) the guardian is entitled to custody of the person of the ward and shall assure that the ward has a place of abode in the least restrictive setting consistent with the essential requirements for the ward's physical health and safety;

(2) the guardian shall assure the care, comfort, and maintenance of the ward;

(3) the guardian shall assure that the ward receives the services necessary to meet the essential requirements for the ward's physical health and safety and to develop or regain, to the maximum extent possible, the capacity to meet the ward's needs for physical health and safety;

(5) the guardian may give consents or approvals necessary to enable the ward to receive medical or other professional care, counsel, treatment, or services except as otherwise limited by (e) of this section;

(6) the guardian has the powers and duties of a conservator under this chapter; however, the guardian may not apply the ward's money or property for the services as guardian or for room and board that the guardian or the guardian's spouse, parent, or child has furnished the ward unless, before payment, the court finds that the ward is financially able to pay and that the charge is reasonable; notice of a request for payment approval shall be provided to at least one relative of the ward if possible; the guardian shall exercise care to conserve any excess money or property for the ward's needs;

(7) if a conservator of the estate of the ward has also been appointed, the guardian shall pay all of the ward's estate received by the guardian to the conservator for management as provided in AS 13.26.401§13.26.575.

(d) A guardian of a ward, for whom a conservator has also been appointed, shall have the custody and care of the ward and is entitled to receive reasonable sums for services and for room and board furnished to the ward as agreed upon between the guardian and the conservator.  The guardian may request the conservator to expend the ward's estate for the ward's care and maintenance.

(e) A guardian may not

(1) place the ward in a facility or institution for the mentally ill other than through a formal commitment proceeding under AS 47.30 in which the ward has a separate guardian ad litem;

(2) consent on behalf of the ward to an abortion, sterilization, psychosurgery, or removal of bodily organs except when necessary to preserve the life or prevent serious impairment of the physical health of the ward;

(3) consent on behalf of the ward to the withholding of lifesaving medical procedures; however, a guardian is not required to oppose the cessation or withholding of lifesaving medical procedures when those procedures will serve only to prolong the dying process and offer no reasonable expectation of effecting a temporary or permanent cure of or relief from the illness or condition being treated unless the ward has clearly stated that lifesaving medical procedures not be withheld; a guardian is not civilly liable for acts or omissions under this paragraph unless the act or omission constitutes gross negligence or reckless or intentional misconduct;

(4) consent on behalf of the ward to the performance of an experimental medical procedure or to participation in a medical experiment not intended to preserve the life or prevent serious impairment of the physical health of the ward;

(5) consent on behalf of the ward to termination of the ward's parental rights;

(6) prohibit the ward from registering to vote or from casting a ballot at public election;

(7) prohibit the ward from applying for and obtaining a driver's license;

(8) prohibit the marriage or divorce of the ward.

(2) if the person to be protected does not reside in this state, in any place where the person has property.

###### Sec. 13.26.415.   Original petition for appointment or protective order.

(a) The person to be protected, a person's attorney or other legal representative, any person who is interested in the estate, affairs, or welfare of the person to be protected, including a parent, guardian, custodian, or caregiver, the Department of Health, or any person who would be adversely affected by lack of effective management of the property and affairs of the person to be protected, may petition for the appointment of a conservator or for other appropriate protective order.

(b) The petition must set out to the extent known, the interest of the petitioner; the name, age, residence and address of the person to be protected; the name and address of the person's guardian, if any; the name and address of the person's nearest relative known to the petitioner; a general statement of the person's property with an estimate of its value, including any compensation, insurance, pension or allowance to which the person is entitled; and the reason why appointment of a conservator or other protective order is necessary.

###### Sec. 13.26.420.   Notice.

Waiver by the person to be protected is not effective unless the person to be protected attends the hearing or, unless minority is the reason for the proceeding, waiver is confirmed in an interview with the visitor.

(b) Notice of a petition for appointment of a conservator or other initial protective order, and of any subsequent hearing, must be given to any person who has filed a request for notice under AS 13.26.425 and to interested persons and other persons as the court may direct.

Any interested person who desires to be notified before any order is made in a protective proceeding may file with the registrar a request for notice subsequent to payment of any fee required by statute or court rule.  The clerk shall mail a copy of the demand to the conservator if one has been appointed.  A request is not effective unless it contains a statement showing the interest of the person making it and the person's address, or that of the person's attorney, and is effective only as to matters occurring after the filing.  Any governmental agency paying or planning to pay benefits to the person to be protected is an interested person in protective proceedings.

###### Sec. 13.26.430.   Procedure concerning hearing and order on original petition.

(a) Upon receipt of a petition for appointment of a conservator or other protective order because of minority, the court shall set a date for hearing on the matters alleged in the petition.  If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines that the interests of the minor are or may be inadequately represented, it may appoint an attorney to represent the minor, giving consideration to the choice of the minor if 14 years of age or older.  A lawyer appointed by the court to represent a minor has the powers and duties of a guardian ad litem.

(b) Upon receipt of a petition for appointment of a conservator or other protective order for reasons other than minority, the court shall set a date for hearing. Unless the person to be protected has counsel of the person's own choice, the court must appoint a lawyer to represent the person. If the alleged disability is mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or disability, advanced age, chronic use of drugs, or chronic intoxication, the court may direct that the person to be protected be examined by a physician designated by the court, preferably a physician who is not connected with any institution in which the person is a patient or is detained. The court may send a visitor to interview the person to be protected. The visitor may be a guardian ad litem or an officer or employee of the court.

(c) After hearing, upon finding that a basis for the appointment of a conservator or other protective order has been established, the court shall make an appointment or other appropriate protective order.

(d) The court shall investigate alternatives to a conservator and the use of a special conservator as provided in AS 13.26.440(c).  A conservator may be appointed only if a less restrictive protective order or the services of a special conservator are not adequate to protect the estate of the protected person.  The court shall, to the extent possible, consult with the protected person in determining what action should be taken.

###### Sec. 13.26.435.   Permissible court orders.

The court has the following powers which may be exercised directly or through a conservator in respect to the estate and affairs of protected persons:

(1) while a petition for appointment of a conservator or other protective order is pending and after preliminary hearing and without notice to others, the court has power to preserve and apply the property of the person to be protected as may be required for the person's benefit or the benefit of the person's dependents;

(2) after hearing and upon determining that a basis for an appointment or other protective order exists with respect to a minor without other disability, the court has all those powers over the estate and affairs of the minor which are or might be necessary for the best interests of the minor, the minor's family and members of the minor's household;

(3) after hearing and upon determining that a basis for an appointment or other protective order exists with respect to a person for reasons other than minority, the court has, for the benefit of the person and members of the person's household, all the powers over the person's estate and affairs which the person could exercise if present and not under disability, except the power to make a will; these powers include, but are not limited to, power to make gifts, to convey or release contingent and expectant interests in property including marital property rights and any right of survivorship incident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety, to exercise or release powers as trustee, personal representative, custodian for minors, conservator, or donee of a power of appointment, to enter into contracts, to create revocable or irrevocable trusts of property of the estate which may extend beyond the person's disability or life, to exercise options of the disabled person to purchase securities or other property, to exercise rights to elect options and change beneficiaries under insurance and annuity policies and to surrender the policies for their cash value, to exercise the right to an elective share in the estate of a deceased spouse, and to renounce any interest by testate or intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer;

(4) the court may exercise, or direct the exercise of its authority to exercise or release powers of appointment of which the protected person is donee, to renounce interests, to make gifts in trust or otherwise exceeding 20 percent of any year's income of the estate, or to change beneficiaries under insurance and annuity policies, only if satisfied, after notice and hearing, that it is in the best interests of the protected person, and that the protected person either is incapable of consenting or has consented to the proposed exercise of power;

(5) an order made pursuant to this section determining that a basis for appointment of a conservator or other protective order exists, has no effect on the capacity of the protected person.

###### Sec. 13.26.440.   Protective arrangements and single transactions authorized.

(a) If it is established in a proper proceeding that a basis exists as described in AS 13.26.401 for affecting the property and affairs of a person the court, without appointing a conservator, may authorize, direct, or ratify any transaction necessary or desirable to achieve any security, service, or care arrangement meeting the foreseeable needs of the protected person.  Protective arrangements include, but are not limited to, payment, delivery, deposit, or retention of funds or property, sale, mortgage, lease, or other transfer of property, entry into an annuity contract, a contract for life care, a deposit contract, a contract for training and education, or addition to or establishment of a suitable trust.

(b) When it has been established in a proper proceeding that a basis exists as described in AS 13.26.401 for affecting the property and affairs of a person the court, without appointing a conservator, may authorize, direct, or ratify any contract, trust, or other transaction relating to the protected person's financial affairs or involving the person's estate if the court determines that the transaction is in the best interests of the protected person.

(c) Before approving a protective arrangement or other transaction under this section, the court shall consider the interests of creditors and dependents of the protected person and, in view of the protected person's disability, whether the protected person needs the continuing protection of a conservator.  If only certain powers need be given to the conservator or the services of a conservator are needed only for a limited number of transactions, a special conservator may be appointed.  The court may appoint a special conservator to assist in the accomplishment of any protective arrangement or other transaction authorized under this section who shall have the authority conferred by the order and serve until discharged by order after report to the court of all matters carried out under the order of appointment.

###### Sec. 13.26.445.   Temporary conservators.

(a) If, during the pendency of an initial petition for conservatorship, it appears that the respondent is in need of a protective order to protect the respondent against waste or dissipation of funds or property, or to obtain funds that are needed for the immediate support, care, and welfare of the respondent or persons entitled to be supported by the respondent, and the respondent is not capable of protecting the respondent's funds or property or obtaining the funds that are needed to support the respondent or persons whom the respondent is required to support, the petitioner may request the appointment of a temporary conservator to authorize the protection or to obtain the necessary funds. The request must state the reasons and factual basis for the request. The petitioner shall immediately file the request with the court and serve copies on the respondent and the respondent's attorney and other persons as ordered by the court. The court shall appoint an attorney for a respondent who is unrepresented to be at the hearing and conduct a hearing within 72 hours after the filing.

(b) If the court determines that a temporary conservator should be appointed, it shall make the appointment and grant to the temporary conservator only the authority that is least restrictive upon the liberty of the respondent and that enables the temporary conservator to provide the protection or authority necessary to protect the respondent from waste or dissipation of funds or property or to obtain the funds necessary for support.

(c) The temporary conservatorship expires at the time of the appointment of a full or partial conservator or on the dismissal of the petition for conservatorship.

###### Sec. 13.26.450.   Ex parte protective orders.

(a) A person who is allowed to file a petition for a protective order under AS 13.26.415(a) may file a petition for an ex parte protective order against a person other than the protected person. A petition filed on behalf of a protected person by a person other than the protected person must be accompanied by proof of service of the petition on the protected person or the person's attorney unless service would cause an immediate threat of harm to the best interests of the protected person and the petition includes a written explanation of the harm. If the court finds that the petition establishes probable cause that the respondent is financially defrauding the petitioner or a person for whose benefit the petitioner filed the petition and that, because of the fraud, there has been or is an immediate threat of a waste or dissipation of the proposed protected person's funds or other property, the court shall ex parte and without notice to the respondent issue a protective order. The petitioner shall certify to the court in writing any effort that the petitioner made to provide notice to the respondent.

(b) An ex parte protective order under this section may

(1) grant any protection described in AS 13.26.435;

(2) supersede an existing power of attorney;

(3) prohibit the respondent from having any direct or indirect contact with the petitioner or other person for whose benefit the petitioner filed the petition; and

(4) prohibit the respondent from taking any act with respect to the funds or other property of the petitioner or other person for whose benefit the petitioner filed the petition.

(c) An ex parte protective order expires 20 days after it is issued, unless dissolved earlier by the court at the request of the petitioner or respondent and after notice and, if requested, a hearing, or on the earlier appointment of a temporary or permanent conservator.

###### Sec. 13.26.455.   Temporary protective orders; conversions.

On application filed with the court before the expiration of a 20-day ex parte protective order issued under AS 13.26.450, the court shall schedule a hearing on whether to convert the protective order to a temporary order effective for up to six months. The court shall provide to the protected person and the respondent at least 10 days' notice of the hearing and the respondent's right to appear and be heard. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent has committed fraud against the petitioner or the person for whose benefit the petition was filed, regardless of whether the respondent appears at the hearing, the court may convert the ex parte protective order to a temporary protective order effective for up to six months.

###### Sec. 13.26.460.   Protective orders; modification; third-party compliance; forms; fees.

(a) The petitioner, respondent, or protected person, if the protected person is a vulnerable adult, may request modification of a protective order issued under AS 13.26.450§13.26.460. Except as provided in (b) of this section, if a request is made for modification of

(1) an ex parte protective order issued under AS 13.26.450, the court shall schedule a hearing on three days' notice or on shorter notice as the court may prescribe; or

(2) a temporary protective order, after notice and hearing under AS 13.26.455, the court shall schedule a hearing within 20 days after the date the request is made, except that, if the court finds that the request is meritless on its face, the court may deny the request without a hearing.

(b) If a request for a modification is made under this section and the respondent raises an issue not raised by the petitioner, the court may allow the petitioner additional time to respond.

(c) If the court modifies a protective order, the court shall issue a modified order and shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the order is understood by the petitioner, the respondent, and the protected person who are present at the hearing.

(d) The court shall cause a copy of a protective order, any related orders, and a scheduling order, if any, to be served on the respondent and the protected person and have a protective order and any related order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement agency for expedited entry in the central registry under AS 18.65.540.

(e) A protective order issued under AS 13.26.450§13.26.460 is in addition to any other civil or criminal remedy.

(f) A third party that has received actual or legal notice of a protective order issued under AS 13.26.450§13.26.460 shall comply with the order. A third party who does not comply with a protective order granted under AS 13.26.450§13.26.460 may be liable in a civil action to the protected person or the protected person's heirs, assigns, or estate for a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000, plus the actual damages, costs, and fees associated with the failure to comply with the protective order. A third party who does not comply with a protective order granted under AS 13.26.450§13.26.460 may also be criminally liable under AS 11.56.740 for violating a protective order. As used in this section, "actual or legal notice" means delivery by mail or facsimile at the most recently known place of residence or business of the third party.

(g) The Alaska Court System, after consulting with the Department of Health, the office of public advocacy, the office of elder fraud and assistance, the long term care ombudsman, and other interested persons and organizations, shall prepare forms for petitions and protective orders and instructions for use of the forms by a person seeking a protective order under AS 13.26.450§13.26.460. The forms must conform to the Alaska Rules of Probate Procedure and Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure, except that information on the forms may be filled in by legible handwriting. The office of the clerk of each superior and district court shall make available to the public the forms a person seeking a protective order may need and instructions for the use of the forms. The clerk shall provide assistance in completing and filing the forms.

(h) Filing fees may not be charged for a petition under AS 13.26.450, for an application under AS 13.26.455, or for a request for modification of a protective order under AS 13.26.460(a).

###### Sec. 13.26.465.   Who may be appointed conservator; priorities.

(a) The court may appoint a competent person, including a private professional conservator, private professional full guardian under AS 08.26.020, or the public guardian, as the conservator of the estate of a protected person.

(b) The court may not appoint a person to be a conservator of a protected person if the person

(1) provides, or is likely to provide during the conservatorship, substantial services to the protected person in a professional or business capacity, other than in the capacity of conservator;

(2) is or is likely to become, during the conservatorship, a creditor of the protected person, other than in the capacity of conservator;

(3) is likely to have, during the conservatorship, interests that may conflict with those of the protected person; or

(4) is employed by a person who would be disqualified under (1)§(3) of this subsection.

(c) A person may be appointed as the conservator of a protected person even if (b) of this section applies if the person is the spouse, adult child, parent, or sibling of the protected person and if the court determines that the potential conflict of interest is not substantial and that the appointment would clearly be in the best interests of the protected person.

(d) Subject to (e) and (f) of this section, qualified persons have priority for appointment in the following order:

(1) an individual or qualified conservator nominated by the protected person if the protected person is 14 or more years of age and had, in the opinion of the court, sufficient mental capacity to make an informed choice;

(2) the spouse of the protected person;

(3) an adult child or a parent of the protected person;

(4) a relative of the protected person with whom the protected person has resided for more than six months during the year before the filing of the petition;

(5) a relative or friend of the protected person who has demonstrated a sincere and longstanding interest in the welfare of the protected person;

(6) a private professional conservator;

(7) the public guardian.

(e) When more than one person has equal priority under (d) of this section, the court shall select the person it considers to be the best qualified.

(f) When in the best interest of the protected person, a court may decline to appoint a person who has priority under (d) of this section as conservator of the protected person and may appoint as conservator a person who has a lower priority than another person or who does not have a priority. If the court appoints a person with a lower priority under (d) of this section than another person, the court shall make appropriate written findings related to why the best interests of the respondent require appointment of the person with a lower priority.

(g) In addition to any other requirement of this section, when appointing a relative or friend of the protected person as the conservator of the protected person, the court shall require that the proposed conservator complete one hour of mandatory education on the basics of conservatorship before the appointment or within 30 days after the appointment. If the person is appointed based on the person's agreement to complete the mandatory education and the person fails to complete the mandatory education within the 30 days, the court shall remove the conservator and appoint a successor.

###### Sec. 13.26.470.   Bond.

(a) The court may require a conservator to furnish a bond conditioned upon faithful discharge of all duties of the trust according to law, with sureties as it shall specify.  Unless otherwise directed, the bond shall be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the property of the estate in the conservator's control plus one year's estimated income minus the value of securities deposited under arrangements requiring an order of the court for their removal and the value of any land which the fiduciary, by express limitation of power, lacks power to sell or convey without court authorization. The court in place of sureties on a bond, may accept other security for the performance of the bond, including a pledge of securities or a mortgage of land.

(b) If the public guardian is appointed as a conservator, the court may not require a bond under this section.

(c) If the court requires a conservator to provide a bond under this section and the conservator is financially unable to provide the bond, the court may order the cost of the bond to be paid from court funds.

###### Sec. 13.26.475.   Terms and requirements of bonds.

(a) The following requirements and provisions apply to any bond required under AS 13.26.470:

(1) unless otherwise provided by the terms of the approved bond, sureties are jointly and severally liable with the conservator and with each other;

(2) by executing an approved bond of a conservator, the surety consents to the jurisdiction of the court which issued letters to the primary obligor in any proceeding pertaining to the fiduciary duties of the conservator and naming the surety as a party defendant; notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the surety or mailed by registered or certified mail to the surety at the address as listed with the court where the bond is filed and to the surety's address as then known to the petitioner;

(3) on petition of a successor conservator or any interested person, a proceeding may be initiated against a surety for breach of the obligation of the bond of the conservator;

(4) the bond of the conservator is not void after the first recovery but may be proceeded against from time to time until the whole penalty is exhausted.

(b) A proceeding may not be commenced against the surety on any matter as to which an action or proceeding against the primary obligor is barred by adjudication or limitation.

###### Sec. 13.26.480.   Acceptance of appointment; consent to jurisdiction; notice.

By accepting appointment, a conservator submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding relating to the estate that may be instituted by any interested person. Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the conservator, or mailed by registered or certified mail to the conservator at the address as listed in the petition for appointment or as thereafter reported to the court and to the conservator's address as then known to the petitioner.

###### Sec. 13.26.485.   Compensation and expenses.

If not otherwise compensated for services rendered, any visitor, lawyer, physician, conservator, or special conservator appointed in a protective proceeding is entitled to reasonable compensation from the estate.

###### Sec. 13.26.490.   Death, resignation, or removal of conservator.

The court may remove a conservator for good cause, upon notice and hearing, or accept the resignation of a conservator. After death, resignation, or removal, the court may appoint another conservator.  A conservator so appointed succeeds to the title and powers of the conservator's predecessor.

###### Sec. 13.26.495.   Petitions for orders subsequent to appointment.

(a) Any person interested in the welfare of a person for whom a conservator has been appointed may file a petition in the appointing court for an order

(1) requiring bond or security or additional bond or security, or reducing bond;

(2) requiring an accounting for the administration of the trust;

(3) directing distribution;

(4) removing the conservator and appointing a temporary or successor conservator; or

(5) granting other appropriate relief.

(b) A conservator may petition the appointing court for instructions concerning the fiduciary responsibility of the conservator.

(c) Upon notice and hearing, the court may give appropriate instructions or make any appropriate order.

###### Sec. 13.26.500.   General duty of conservator.

In the exercise of powers, a conservator shall act as fiduciary and shall observe the standards of care applicable to trustees under AS 13.36.225§13.36.290.

###### Sec. 13.26.505.   Inventory, implementation report, and records.

Within 90 days after distribution of the order of appointment, every conservator shall prepare and file with the appointing court a conservator implementation report and a complete inventory of the estate of the protected person together with an oath or affirmation that it is complete and accurate so far as the conservator is informed. The conservator shall provide a copy of it to the protected person if the protected person can be located, has attained the age of 14 years, and has sufficient mental capacity to understand these matters, and to any parent or guardian with whom the protected person resides. The conservator shall keep suitable records of the administration and exhibit them on request of any interested person.

###### Sec. 13.26.510.   Accounts.

A conservator shall submit a report to the court at least every year. In addition, a conservator shall account to the court for administration of the trust upon resignation or removal and at other times as the court may direct. On termination of the protected person's minority or disability, a conservator may account to the court or to the former protected person or the protected person's personal representative. Subject to appeal or vacation within the time permitted, an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing an intermediate account of a conservator, adjudicates as to the conservator's liabilities concerning the matters considered in connection with it; and an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing a final account, adjudicates as to all previously unsettled liabilities of the conservator to the protected person or the protected person's successors relating to the conservatorship. In connection with any account, the court may require a conservator to submit to a physical check of the estate in the conservator's control, to be made in any manner the court may specify.

###### Sec. 13.26.515.   Visitor reports.

(a) The initial visitor report of a visitor appointed under AS 13.26.430(b) must include

(1) the results and analyses of medical and other tests and examinations performed that describe the proposed protected person's mental, emotional, physical, and educational condition, adaptive behavior, and social skills, and that specify the data on which the description is based;

(2) recommendations regarding the types and extent of assistance, if any, necessary to meet the essential requirements for managing the property and affairs of the proposed protected person;

(3) an evaluation of the proposed protected person's need for mental health treatment and whether there is a substantial probability that available treatment will significantly improve the proposed protected person's mental condition;

(4) an evaluation of the proposed protected person's need for educational or vocational assistance and whether the assistance can be made available to the protected person;

(5) an evaluation of the probability that the incapacity may significantly lessen, and the type of services or treatment that will facilitate improvement in the condition or skills of the proposed protected person;

(6) a list of the names and addresses of all individuals who examined, interviewed, or investigated the proposed protected person, and the names and addresses of all persons contacted in preparation of the visitor report;

(7) a summary of the information that

(A) was supplied by the person described in (6) of this subsection; and

(B) supports the conclusions of the visitor report;

(8) a description of the alternatives to conservatorship that were considered and not recommended and an explanation of why they are not feasible to meet the needs of the proposed protected person;

(9) a specification of the financial resources of the proposed protected person, the proposed protected person's entitlements to insurance benefits, and publicly operated or sponsored health, mental health, and welfare assistance that might be employed in the provision of services to the proposed protected person; and

(10) if conservatorship is recommended, a conservatorship outline that identifies

(A) potential conservators;

(B) the specific services necessary and available to protect the proposed protected person from serious damage to the proposed protected person's property and affairs;

(C) the means by which the services described in (B) of this paragraph may be financed;

(D) the specific, least restrictive authority needed by the conservator to provide the services described in (B) of this paragraph.

(b) In addition to any initial visitor report provided under (a) of this section, every third year, the court may appoint a visitor to file a report reviewing the conservatorship during the period since the last visitor report, if any.

(c) In addition to the reports under (a) and (b) of this section, at any time during a conservatorship, a court may appoint a visitor to file a report reviewing the conservatorship during the period since the last visitor report, if any.

(d) A visitor report provided under (b) or (c) of this section must include

(1) the name and address of the protected person and the conservator;

(2) the services being provided to the protected person by or through the conservator;

(3) the significant actions taken by the conservator during the reporting period in regard to the protected person;

(4) a financial accounting of the estate that has been subject to the possession or control of the conservator;

(5) a list of the number and nature of the contacts between the conservator and the protected person if the protected person does not reside with the conservator;

(6) any other information requested by the court or necessary or desirable in the opinion of the visitor.

###### Sec. 13.26.520.   Conservators; title by appointment.

The appointment of a conservator vests in the conservator title as trustee to all property of the protected person, presently held or thereafter acquired, including title to any property theretofore held for the protected person by custodians or attorneys-in-fact.  The appointment of a conservator is not a transfer or alienation within the meaning of general provisions of any federal or state statute or regulation, insurance policy, pension plan, contract, will or trust instrument, imposing restrictions upon or penalties for transfer or alienation by the protected person of any rights or interest, but this section does not restrict the ability of persons to make specific provision by contract or dispositive instrument relating to a conservator.

###### Sec. 13.26.525.   Recording of conservator's letters.

Letters of conservatorship are evidence of transfer of all assets of a protected person to the conservator.  An order terminating a conservatorship is evidence of transfer of all assets of the estate from the conservator to the protected person, or the protected person's successors. Subject to the requirements of general statutes governing the recordation of documents of title to land or other property, letters of conservatorship, and orders terminating conservatorships, may be recorded to give record notice of title as between the conservator and the protected person.

###### Sec. 13.26.530.   Sale, encumbrance, or transaction involving conflict of interest voidable.

Any sale or encumbrance to a conservator, the conservator's spouse, agent, or attorney, or any corporation or trust in which the conservator has a substantial beneficial interest, or any transaction which is affected by a substantial conflict of interest is voidable unless the transaction is approved by the court after notice to interested persons and others as directed by the court.

###### Sec. 13.26.535.   Persons dealing with conservators; protection.

A person who in good faith either assists a conservator or deals with the conservator for value in any transaction other than those requiring a court order as provided in AS 13.26.435, is protected as if the conservator properly exercised the power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, except that restrictions on powers of conservators which are endorsed on letters as provided in AS 13.26.550 are effective as to third persons.  A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a conservator.  The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters.  The protection here expressed is not by substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.

###### Sec. 13.26.540.   Powers of conservator in administration.

(a) A conservator has all of the powers conferred herein and any additional powers conferred by law on trustees in this state. In addition, a conservator of the estate of an unmarried minor, as to whom no one has parental rights, has the duties and powers of a guardian of a minor described in  AS 13.26.167 until the minor attains the age of 18 or marries, but the parental rights so conferred on a conservator do not preclude appointment of a guardian as provided by  AS 13.26.101§ 13.26.186.

(b) A conservator has power without court authorization or confirmation, to invest and reinvest funds of the estate as would a trustee.

(c) A conservator, acting reasonably in efforts to accomplish the purpose for which the conservator was appointed, may act, without court authorization or confirmation, to

(1) collect, hold and retain assets of the estate including land in another state, until, in the conservator's judgment, disposition of the assets should be made, and the assets may be retained even though they include an asset in which the conservator is personally interested;

(2) receive additions to the estate;

(3) continue or participate in the operation of any business or other enterprise;

(4) acquire an undivided interest in an estate asset in which the conservator, in any fiduciary capacity, holds an undivided interest;

(5) invest and reinvest estate assets in accordance with (b) of this section;

(6) deposit estate funds in a bank including a bank operated by the conservator;

(7) acquire or dispose of an estate asset including land in another state for cash or on credit, at public or private sale; and to manage, develop, improve, exchange, partition, change the character of, or abandon an estate asset;

(8) make ordinary or extraordinary repairs or alterations in buildings or other structures, to demolish any improvements, to raze existing or erect new party walls or buildings;

(9) subdivide, develop, or dedicate land to public use; to make or obtain the vacation of plats and adjust boundaries; to adjust differences in valuation on exchange or to partition by giving or receiving considerations; and to dedicate easements to public use without consideration;

(10) enter for any purpose into a lease as lessor or lessee with or without option to purchase or renew for a term within or extending beyond the term of the conservatorship;

(11) enter into a lease or arrangement for exploration and removal of minerals or other natural resources or enter into a pooling or unitization agreement;

(12) grant an option involving disposition of an estate asset, to take an option for the acquisition of any asset;

(13) vote a security, in person or by general or limited proxy;

(14) pay calls, assessments, and any other sums chargeable or accruing against or on account of securities;

(15) sell or exercise stock subscription or conversion rights; to consent, directly or through a committee or other agent, to the reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, or liquidation of a corporation or other business enterprise;

(16) hold a security in the name of a nominee or in other form without disclosure of the conservatorship so that title to the security may pass by delivery, but the conservator is liable for any act of the nominee in connection with the stock so held;

(17) insure the assets of the estate against damage or loss, and the conservator against liability with respect to third persons;

(18) borrow money to be repaid from estate assets or otherwise; to advance money for the protection of the estate or the protected person, and for all expenses, losses, and liability sustained in the administration of the estate or because of the holding or ownership of any estate assets, and the conservator has a lien on the estate as against the protected person from advances so made;

(19) pay or contest any claim; to settle a claim by or against the estate or the protected person by compromise, arbitration, or otherwise; and to release, in whole or in part, any claim belonging to the estate to the extent that the claim is uncollectible;

(20) pay taxes, assessments, compensation of the conservator, and other expenses incurred in the collection, care, administration, and protection of the estate;

(21) allocate items of income or expense to either estate income or principal, as provided by law, including creation of reserves out of income for depreciation, obsolescence, or amortization, or for depletion in mineral or timber properties;

(22) pay any sum distributable to a protected person or the protected person's dependent, without liability to the conservator, by paying the sum to the distributee or by paying the sum for the use of the distributee either to the distributee's guardian or if none, to a relative or other person with custody of the distributee's person;

(23) employ persons, including attorneys, auditors, investment advisors, or agents, even though they are associated with the conservator to advise or assist the conservator in the performance of administrative duties; to act upon their recommendation without independent investigation; and instead of acting personally, to employ one or more agents to perform any act of administration, whether or not discretionary;

(24) prosecute or defend actions, claims or proceedings in any jurisdiction for the protection of estate assets and of the conservator in the performance of duties; and

(25) execute and deliver all instruments which will accomplish or facilitate the exercise of the powers vested in the conservator.

###### Sec. 13.26.545.   Distributive duties and powers of conservator.

(a) A conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the estate without court authorization or confirmation for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected person and the protected person's dependents in accordance with the following principles:

(1) the conservator is to consider recommendations relating to the appropriate standard of support, education, and benefit for the protected person made by a parent or guardian, if any; the conservator may not be surcharged for sums paid to persons or organizations actually furnishing support, education, or care to the protected person pursuant to the recommendations of a parent or guardian of the protected person unless the conservator knows that the parent or guardian is deriving personal financial benefit therefrom, including relief from any personal duty of support, or unless the recommendations are clearly not in the best interests of the protected person;

(2) the conservator is to expend or distribute sums reasonably necessary for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected person with due regard to

(A) the size of the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship, and the likelihood that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully able to manage the protected person's affairs and the estate which has been conserved;

(B) the accustomed standard of living of the protected person and members of the protected person's household;

(C) other funds or sources used for the support of the protected person;

(3) the conservator may expend funds of the estate for the support of persons legally dependent on the protected person and others who are members of the protected person's household who are unable to support themselves and who are in need of support;

(4) funds expended under this subsection may be paid by the conservator to any person, including the protected person to reimburse for expenditures which the conservator might have made, or in advance for services to be rendered to the protected person when it is reasonable to expect that they will be performed and where advance payments are customary or reasonably necessary under the circumstances.

(b) If the estate is ample to provide for the purposes implicit in the distributions authorized by (a) of this section, a conservator for a protected person other than a minor has power to make gifts to charity and other objects as the protected person might have been expected to make, in amounts which do not exceed in total for any year 20 percent of the income from the estate.

(c) When a minor who has not been adjudged disabled under AS 13.26.401(2) attains majority, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.

(d) When the conservator is satisfied that a protected person's disability (other than minority) has ceased, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the formerly protected person as soon as possible.

(e) If a protected person dies, the conservator shall deliver to the court for safekeeping any will of the deceased protected person that may have come into the conservator's possession and inform the executor or a beneficiary named in the will that the will has been so delivered. Once a conservator knows that the protected person has died, the conservator may not exercise authority over the protected person's affairs and estate except to pay reasonable burial expenses and to preserve, account for, and transfer control of assets to a personal representative, a temporary property custodian appointed by the court, or a person authorized to take custody of personal property by affidavit under AS 13.16.680. If, after 40 days from the death of the protected person, no other person has been appointed personal representative and no application or petition for appointment is before the court, the conservator may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative in order to proceed with administering and distributing the decedent's estate without additional or further appointment. Upon application for an order granting the powers of a personal representative to a conservator, after notice to any person demanding notice under AS 13.16.070 and to any person nominated executor in any will of which the applicant is aware, the court may order the conferral of the power upon determining that there is no objection, and endorse the letters of the conservator to note that the formerly protected person is deceased and that the conservator has acquired all of the powers and duties of a personal representative. The making and entry of an order under this section has the effect of an order of appointment of a personal representative as provided in AS 13.16.115 and 13.16.245§13.16.655 except that estate in the name of the conservator, after administration, may be distributed to the decedent's successors without prior retransfer to the conservator as personal representative.

###### Sec. 13.26.550.   Enlargement or limitation of powers of conservator.

Subject to the restrictions in AS 13.26.435(4), the court may confer on a conservator at the time of appointment or later, in addition to the powers conferred by AS 13.26.540 and 13.26.545, any power which the court itself could exercise under AS 13.26.435(2) and (3).  The court may, at the time of appointment or later, limit the powers of a conservator otherwise conferred by AS 13.26.540 and 13.26.545 or previously conferred by the court, and may at any time relieve the conservator of any limitation.  If the court limits any power conferred on the conservator by AS 13.26.540 and 13.26.545, the limitation shall be endorsed upon the letters of appointment.

###### Sec. 13.26.555.   Preservation of estate plan.

In investing the estate, and in selecting assets of the estate for distribution under AS 13.26.545(a) and (b), in utilizing powers of revocation or withdrawal available for the support of the protected person, and exercisable by the conservator or the court, the conservator and the court should take into account any known estate plan of the protected person, including a will, any revocable trust of which the protected person is settlor, and any contract, transfer, or joint ownership arrangement with provisions for payment or transfer of benefits or interests at death to another or others which the protected person may have originated. The conservator may examine the will of the protected person.

###### Sec. 13.26.560.   Claims against estate and protected person; enforcement.

(a) Subject to AS 13.26.545(e), a conservator shall pay from the estate all just claims against the estate and against the protected person arising before or after the conservatorship was established upon their presentation and allowance. A claim is considered presented on the first to occur of receipt of the written statement of claim by the conservator or the filing of the claim with the court. A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed by written statement mailed by the conservator to the claimant within 60 days after its presentation. The presentation of a claim tolls any statute of limitations relating to the claim until 30 days after its disallowance. A claim may be presented by either of the following methods:

(1) the claimant may deliver or mail to the conservator a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed;

(2) the claimant may file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the court and deliver or mail a copy of the statement to the conservator.

(b) A claimant whose claim has not been paid may petition the court for determination of the claim at any time before it is barred by the applicable statute of limitation, and, upon due proof, procure an order for its allowance and payment from the estate.  If a proceeding is pending against a protected person at the time of appointment of a conservator or is initiated against the protected person thereafter, the moving party must give notice of the proceeding to the conservator if the outcome is to constitute a claim against the estate.

(c) If it appears that the estate in a conservatorship is likely to be exhausted before all existing claims are paid, preference is to be given to prior claims for the care, maintenance, and education of the protected person or the protected person's dependents and existing claims for expenses of administration.

###### Sec. 13.26.565.   Individual liability of conservator.

(a) Unless otherwise provided in the contract, a conservator is not individually liable on a contract properly entered into in a fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the estate unless the conservator fails to reveal the representative capacity and identify the estate in the contract.

(b) The conservator is individually liable for obligations arising from ownership or control of property of the estate or for torts committed in the course of administration of the estate only if personally at fault.

(c) Claims based on contracts entered into by a conservator in a fiduciary capacity, on obligations arising from ownership or control of the estate, or on torts committed in the course of administration of the estate may be asserted against the estate by proceeding against the conservator in the fiduciary capacity, whether or not the conservator is individually liable for them.

(d) Any question of liability between the estate and the conservator individually may be determined in a proceeding for accounting, surcharge, or indemnification, or other appropriate proceeding or action.

###### Sec. 13.26.570.   Termination of proceeding.

The protected person, the protected person's personal representative, the conservator, or any other interested person may petition the court to terminate the conservatorship.  A protected person seeking termination is entitled to the same rights and procedures as in an original proceeding for a protective order.  The court, upon determining after notice and hearing that the minority or disability of the protected person has ceased, may terminate the conservatorship.  Upon termination, title to assets of the estate passes to the former protected person or to the person's successors subject to provision in the order for expenses of administration or to conveyances from the conservator to the former protected person or the person's successors, to evidence the transfer.

###### Sec. 13.26.575.   Payment of debt and delivery of property to foreign conservator without local proceedings.

(a) Any person indebted to a protected person, or having possession of property or of an instrument evidencing a debt, stock, or chose in action belonging to a protected person may pay or deliver to a conservator, guardian of the estate, or other like fiduciary appointed by a court of the state of residence of the protected person, upon being presented with proof of the fiduciary's appointment and an affidavit made by the fiduciary or on the fiduciary's behalf stating:

(1) that no protective proceeding relating to the protected person is pending in this state; and

(2) that the foreign conservator is entitled to payment or to receive delivery.

(b) If the person to whom the affidavit is presented is not aware of any protective proceeding pending in this state, payment or delivery in response to the demand and affidavit discharges the debtor or possessor.

###### Sec. 13.26.580.   Foreign conservators.

If no local conservator has been appointed and no petition in a protective proceeding is pending in this state, a domiciliary foreign conservator may file with a court in this state in a judicial district in which property belonging to the protected person is located, authenticated copies of appointment and of any official bond given.  Thereafter, the domiciliary foreign conservator may exercise as to assets in this state all powers of a local conservator and may maintain actions and proceedings in this state subject to any conditions imposed upon nonresident parties generally.

###### Sec. 13.26.595.   Definitions.

In AS 13.26.401§13.26.595, unless the context requires otherwise, "fraud" means

(1) robbery, extortion, and coercion under AS 11.41.500§11.41.530;

(2) offenses against property under AS 11.46.100§11.46.740; or

(3) exploitation of another person or another person's resources for personal profit or advantage if no significant benefit accrues to the person who is exploited.

#### Article 5. Powers of Attorney.

###### Sec. 13.26.600.   Execution of power of attorney.

(a) A power of attorney executed in this state is valid if the principal

(1) signs the power of attorney or, if the principal is physically unable to sign the power of attorney, directs, in the principal's conscious presence, another individual to sign the principal's name on the power of attorney; and

(2) acknowledges the signature before a notary public or other individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments.

(b) Notwithstanding AS 44.50.062(5)(A), a notary public may consider that the principal has signed a power of attorney if the principal is physically unable to sign the power of attorney, and, in the presence of the notary public, directs another individual to sign under (a)(1) of this section.

###### Sec. 13.26.605.   Agent's acceptance and liability.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, a person accepts appointment as an agent under a power of attorney by exercising authority or performing duties as an agent or by any other assertion or conduct indicating acceptance.

(b) An agent that violates a provision in AS 13.26.600§13.26.695 is liable to the principal or the principal's successors in interest for the amount required to

(1) restore the value of the principal's property to what it would have been had the violation not occurred; and

(2) reimburse the principal or the principal's successors in interest for the attorney fees and costs paid on the agent's behalf.

###### Sec. 13.26.610.   Agent's duties.

(a) Notwithstanding provisions in the power of attorney, an agent that has accepted appointment shall

(1) act in accordance with the principal's reasonable expectations to the extent actually known by the agent and, otherwise, in the principal's best interest;

(2) act in good faith; and

(3) act only within the scope of authority granted in the power of attorney.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, an agent that has accepted appointment shall

(1) act loyally for the principal's benefit;

(5) cooperate with a person that has authority to make health care decisions for the principal to carry out the principal's reasonable expectations to the extent actually known by the agent and otherwise act in the principal's best interest; and

(6) attempt to preserve the principal's estate plan, to the extent actually known by the agent, if preserving the plan is consistent with the principal's best interest based on all relevant factors, including

(A) the value and nature of the principal's property;

(B) the principal's foreseeable obligations and need for maintenance;

(C) minimization of taxes, including income, estate, inheritance, generation-skipping transfer, and gift taxes; and

(D) eligibility for a benefit, a program, or assistance under a statute or regulation.

(c) An agent that acts in good faith is not liable to any beneficiary of the principal's estate plan for failure to preserve the plan.

(d) An agent that acts with care, competence, and diligence for the best interest of the principal is not liable solely because the agent also benefits from the act or has an individual or conflicting interest in relation to the property or affairs of the principal.

(e) If an agent is selected by the principal because of special skills or expertise possessed by the agent or in reliance on the agent's representation that the agent has special skills or expertise, the special skills or expertise must be considered in determining whether the agent has acted with care, competence, and diligence under the circumstances.

(f) Absent a breach of duty to the principal, an agent is not liable if the value of the principal's property declines.

(g) An agent that exercises authority to delegate to another person the authority granted by the principal or that engages another person on behalf of the principal is not liable for an act, error of judgment, or default of that person if the agent exercises care, competence, and diligence in selecting and monitoring the person.

(h) Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, an agent is not required to disclose receipts, disbursements, or transactions conducted on behalf of the principal unless ordered by a court or requested by the principal, a guardian, a conservator, another fiduciary acting for the principal, a governmental agency having authority to protect the welfare of the principal, or, upon the death of the principal, the personal representative or successor in interest of the principal's estate. If so requested, within 30 days, the agent shall comply with the request or provide a writing or other record substantiating why additional time is needed and shall comply with the request within an additional 30 days.

(3) a person may not require an additional or different form of power of attorney for authority granted in the power of attorney presented.

(2) engaging in a transaction with the agent or principal in the same circumstances would be inconsistent with federal law;

(3) the person has actual knowledge of the termination of the agent's authority or of the power of attorney before exercise of the power;

(4) a request for a certification, a translation, or an opinion of counsel under (a) of this section is refused;

(6) the person makes, or has actual knowledge that another person has made, a report to the Department of Health or other governmental agency, stating a good faith belief that the principal may be subject to physical or financial abuse, neglect, exploitation, or abandonment by the agent or a person acting for or with the agent.

###### Sec. 13.26.625.   Powers of attorney not revoked until notice of death or incapacity.

(a) The death or incapacity of a principal who has executed a power of attorney in writing does not revoke or terminate the agency as to the agent or other person who, without actual knowledge of the death or incapacity of the principal, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. Action so taken, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the heirs, devisees, and personal representatives of the principal.

(b) An affidavit executed by the agent stating that the agent did not have, at the time of doing an act under the power of attorney, actual knowledge of the revocation or termination of the power of attorney by death or incapacity, is, in the absence of fraud, conclusive proof of the nonrevocation or nontermination of the power of attorney at that time. If the exercise of the power of attorney requires execution and delivery of an instrument that is recordable, the affidavit when authenticated for record is likewise recordable.

###### Sec. 13.26.670.   Validity of modified statutory form power of attorney.

A power of attorney that satisfies the requirements of AS 13.26.645§13.26.665 is not prevented from being a statutory form power of attorney by the fact that it also contains additional language that

If a conservator is later appointed for the principal, during the continuance of the appointment , the agent is accountable to the conservator as well as to the principal.

The legislature recognizes that many Alaskans, for reasons of incapacity or minority, are in need of a guardian or conservator.  Often these persons cannot find a person able and willing to serve as guardian or conservator.  The legislature intends through AS 13.26.700§13.26.750 to establish the function of public guardian for the purpose of furnishing guardianship and conservatorship services.  It further intends by establishing this function to provide assistance to guardians throughout the state in securing necessary services for their wards and to assist the courts, attorneys, visitors, respondents, and proposed guardians in the orderly and expeditious handling of guardianship proceedings.

###### Sec. 13.26.710.   Public guardian.

(a) The office of public advocacy (AS 44.21.400) shall serve as the public guardian.

(b) A court may order the public guardian to act as full guardian, partial guardian, conservator, or special conservator for a person who is determined under this chapter to be in need of guardianship or conservatorship service if no person or private guardianship association is willing and qualified to perform the function.

###### Sec. 13.26.720.   Powers and duties of public guardian.

(a) The public guardian has the same powers and duties with respect to the public guardian's wards and protected persons as a private guardian or conservator.

(b) The public guardian, when appointed as guardian or conservator, shall endeavor, for as long as practical, to find a suitable private guardian or conservator for the public guardian's ward or protected person.

(c) The public guardian shall

(1) establish and maintain relationships with governmental, public, and private agencies, institutions, and organizations to assure the most effective guardianship or conservatorship program for each ward and protected person;

The public guardian may, on the public guardian's own motion or at the request of the court, intervene in a guardianship or conservatorship proceeding if the public guardian or the court considers the intervention to be justified because

(1) an appointed guardian or conservator is not fulfilling duties;

(2) the estate is subject to waste as a result of the costs of the guardianship or conservatorship;

(3) a willing and qualified guardian or conservator is not available; or

(4) the best interests of the ward, respondent, protected person, or person who is the subject of a conservatorship proceeding require the intervention.

The public guardian may employ staff and delegate to members of the staff or to volunteers the powers and duties as guardian or conservator and other powers and duties under this chapter.

(e) Before the office of public advocacy releases a ward's funds following the termination of the public guardian's appointment, the office may collect from the ward's funds held by the office the reasonable value of the services rendered without cost to the ward or protected person.

(f) The annual estimated balance in the account maintained under AS 37.05.142 may be used by the legislature to make appropriations to the Department of Administration to carry out the purposes of AS 44.21.400§44.21.410 (office of public advocacy).

(Select one and initial):

AGENCY DESIGNATION SURVIVES DISABILITY OR INCAPACITY OF PARTIES

AGENCY DESIGNATION TERMINATES ON DISABILITY OR INCAPACITY OF PARTIES.

(b) A contract of deposit that does not contain provisions in substantially the form provided in (a) of this section is governed by the provisions of  AS 13.33.201§13.33.227 applicable to the type of account that most nearly conforms to the depositor's intent.

###### Sec. 13.33.205.   Designation of agent and termination of authority.

(a) By writing signed by all parties, the parties may designate as agent of all parties on an account a person other than a party.

(b) Unless the terms of an agency designation provide that the authority of the agent terminates on disability or incapacity of a party, the agent's authority survives disability and incapacity. The agent may act for a disabled or incapacitated party until the authority of the agent is terminated.

(c) Death of the sole party or last surviving party terminates the authority of an agent.

###### Sec. 13.33.206.   Applicability.

The provisions of AS 13.33.211§13.33.216 concerning beneficial ownership as between parties or as between parties and beneficiaries apply only to controversies between those persons and their creditors and other successors and do not apply to the right of those persons to payment as determined by the terms of the account. AS 13.33.221§13.33.227 govern the liability and setoff rights of financial institutions that make payments under AS 13.33.221§13.33.227.

###### Sec. 13.33.211.   Ownership during lifetime.

(a) During the lifetime of all parties, an account belongs to the parties in proportion to the net contribution of each to the sums on deposit, unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent. As between parties married to each other, in the absence of proof otherwise, the net contribution of each is presumed to be an equal amount.

(b) A beneficiary in an account having a POD designation does not have a right to sums on deposit during the lifetime of any party.

(c) An agent in an account with an agency designation does not have a beneficial right to sums on deposit.

(d) In this section, "net contribution" of a party means the sum of all deposits to an account made by or for the party, less all payments from the account made to or for the party that have not been paid to or applied to the use of another party and a proportionate share of any charges deducted from the account, plus a proportionate share of any interest or dividends earned, whether or not included in the current balance. The term includes deposit life insurance proceeds added to the account by reason of death of the party whose net contribution is in question.

###### Sec. 13.33.212.   Rights at death.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in AS 13.33.201§13.33.227, on death of a party, sums on deposit in a multiple-party account belong to the surviving party or parties. If two or more parties survive and one is the surviving spouse of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent immediately before death was beneficially entitled under AS 13.33.211 belongs to the surviving spouse. If two or more parties survive and none is the surviving spouse of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent immediately before death was beneficially entitled under AS 13.33.211 belongs to the surviving parties in equal shares and augments the proportion to which each survivor immediately before the decedent's death was beneficially entitled under AS 13.33.211, and the right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties.

(b) In an account with a POD designation

(1) on death of one of two or more parties, the rights in sums on deposit are governed by (a) of this section;

(2) on death of the sole party or the last survivor of two or more parties, sums on deposit belong to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries; if two or more beneficiaries survive, sums on deposit belong to them in equal and undivided shares, and there is no right of survivorship in the event of death of a beneficiary after coming into ownership; if no beneficiary survives, sums on deposit belong to the estate of the last surviving party.

(c) Sums on deposit in a single-party account without a POD designation, or in a multiple-party account that, by the terms of the account, is without right of survivorship, are not affected by death of a party, but the amount to which the decedent immediately before death was beneficially entitled under AS 13.33.211 is transferred as part of the decedent's estate. A POD designation in a multiple-party account without right of survivorship is ineffective. For purposes of this section, designation of an account as a tenancy in common establishes that the account is without right of survivorship.

(d) The ownership right of a surviving party or beneficiary, or of the decedent's estate, in sums on deposit is subject to requests for payment made by a party before the party's death, whether paid by the financial institution before or after death, or unpaid. The surviving party or beneficiary, or the decedent's estate, is liable to the payee of an unpaid request for payment. The liability is limited to a proportionate share of the amount transferred under this section to the extent necessary to discharge the request for payment.

###### Sec. 13.33.213.   Alteration of rights.

(a) Rights at death under AS 13.33.212 are determined by the terms of the account at the death of a party. The terms of the account may be altered by written notice given by a party to the financial institution to change the terms of the account or to stop or vary payment under the terms of the account. The notice shall be signed by a party and received by the financial institution during the party's lifetime.

(b) A right of survivorship arising from the express terms of the account, AS 13.33.212, or a POD designation may not be altered by will.

###### Sec. 13.33.214.   Accounts and transfers nontestamentary.

Except as provided in AS 13.12.201§13.12.214 or as a consequence of and to the extent directed by AS 13.33.215, a transfer resulting from the application of AS 13.33.212 is effective by reason of the terms of the account involved and AS 13.33.201§13.33.227 and is not testamentary or subject to AS 13.06§AS 13.21.

###### Sec. 13.33.215.   Rights of creditors and others.

(a) If other assets of the estate are insufficient, a transfer resulting from a right of survivorship or POD designation under AS 13.33.201§13.33.227 is not effective against the estate of a deceased party to the extent needed to pay claims against the estate and statutory allowances to the surviving spouse and children.

(b) A surviving party or beneficiary who receives payment from an account after death of a party is liable to account to the personal representative of the decedent for a proportionate share of the amount received to which the decedent immediately before death was beneficially entitled under AS 13.33.211, to the extent necessary to discharge the claims and allowances described in (a) of this section remaining unpaid after application of the decedent's estate. A proceeding to assert the liability may not be commenced unless the personal representative has received a written demand by the surviving spouse, a creditor, a child, or a person acting for a child of the decedent. The proceeding must be commenced within one year after death of the decedent.

(c) A surviving party or beneficiary against whom a proceeding to account is brought may join as a party to the proceeding a surviving party or beneficiary of any other account of the decedent.

(d) Sums recovered by the personal representative shall be administered as part of the decedent's estate. This section does not affect the protection from claims of the personal representative or estate of a deceased party provided in AS 13.33.226 for a financial institution that makes payment in accordance with the terms of the account.

###### Sec. 13.33.216.   Community property and tenancy by the entirety.

(a) A deposit of community property in an account does not alter the community character of the property or community rights in the property, but a right of survivorship between parties married to each other arising from the express terms of the account or AS 13.33.212 may not be altered by will.

(b) AS 13.33.201§13.33.227 do not affect the law governing tenancy by the entirety.

###### Sec. 13.33.221.   Authority of financial institution.

A financial institution may enter into a contract of deposit for a multiple-party account to the same extent it may enter into a contract of deposit for a single-party account and may provide for a POD designation and an agency designation in either a single-party account or a multiple-party account. A financial institution need not inquire as to the source of a deposit to an account or as to the proposed application of a payment from an account.

###### Sec. 13.33.222.   Payment on multiple-party account.

A financial institution, on request, may pay sums on deposit in a multiple-party account to

(1) one or more of the parties whether or not another party is disabled, incapacitated, or deceased when payment is requested and whether or not the party making the request survives another party; or

(2) the personal representative, if any, or, if there is none, the heirs or devisees of a deceased party if proof of death is presented to the financial institution showing that the deceased party was the survivor of all other persons named on the account either as a party or beneficiary, unless the account is without right of survivorship under AS 13.33.212.

###### Sec. 13.33.223.   Payment on POD designation.

A financial institution, on request, may pay sums on deposit in an account with a POD designation to

(1) one or more of the parties whether or not another party is disabled, incapacitated, or deceased when the payment is requested and whether or not a party survives another party;

(2) the beneficiary or beneficiaries if proof of death is presented to the financial institution showing that the beneficiary or beneficiaries survived all persons named as parties; or

(3) the personal representative, if any, or, if there is none, the heirs or devisees of a deceased party if proof of death is presented to the financial institution showing that the deceased party was the survivor of all other persons named on the account either as a party or beneficiary.

###### Sec. 13.33.224.   Payment to designated agent.

A financial institution, on request of an agent under an agency designation for an account, may pay to the agent sums on deposit in the account whether or not a party is disabled, incapacitated, or deceased when the request is made or received and whether or not the authority of the agent terminates on the disability or incapacity of a party.

###### Sec. 13.33.225.   Payment to minor.

If a financial institution is required or permitted to make payment under AS 13.33.201§13.33.227 to a minor designated as a beneficiary, payment may be made under AS 13.46.

###### Sec. 13.33.226.   Discharge.

(a) Payment made under AS 13.33.201§13.33.227 in accordance with the terms of the account discharges the financial institution from all claims for amounts so paid, whether or not the payment is consistent with the beneficial ownership of the account as between parties, beneficiaries, or their successors. Payment may be made whether or not a party, beneficiary, or agent is disabled, incapacitated, or deceased when payment is requested, received, or made.

(b) Protection under this section does not extend to payments made after a financial institution has received written notice from a party, or from the personal representative, surviving spouse, or heir or devisee of a deceased party, to the effect that payments in accordance with the terms of the account, including one having an agency designation, should not be permitted, and the financial institution has had a reasonable opportunity to act on it when the payment is made. Unless the notice is withdrawn by the person giving it, the successor of any deceased party must concur in a request for payment if the financial institution is to be protected under this section. Unless a financial institution has been served with process in an action or proceeding, other notice or other information shown to have been available to the financial institution does not affect its right to protection under this section.

(c) A financial institution that receives written notice under this section or otherwise has reason to believe that a dispute exists as to the rights of the parties may refuse, without liability, to make payments in accordance with the terms of the account.

(d) Protection of a financial institution under this section does not affect the rights of parties in disputes between themselves or their successors concerning the beneficial ownership of sums on deposit in accounts or payments made from accounts.

###### Sec. 13.33.227.   Setoff.

Without qualifying any other statutory right to setoff or lien and subject to any contractual provision, if a party is indebted to a financial institution, the financial institution has a right to setoff against the account. The amount of the account subject to setoff is the proportion to which the party is, or immediately before death was, beneficially entitled under AS 13.33.211 or, in the absence of proof of that proportion, an equal share with all parties.

#### Article 3. Uniform Transfer-On-Death Security Registration Act.

###### Sec. 13.33.301.   Definitions.

In AS 13.33.301§13.33.310,

(1) "beneficiary form" means a registration of a security that indicates the present owner of the security and the intention of the owner regarding the person who will become the owner of the security upon the death of the owner;

(2) "POD" means "pay on death";

(3) "register," including its derivatives, means to issue a certificate showing the ownership of a certificated security or, in the case of an uncertificated security, to initiate or transfer an account showing ownership of securities;

(4) "registering entity" means a person who originates or transfers a security title by registration and includes a broker maintaining security accounts for customers and a transfer agent or other person acting for or as an issuer of securities;

(5) "security" means a share, participation, or other interest in property, in a business, or in an obligation of an enterprise or other issuer and includes a certificated security, an uncertificated security, and a security account;

(6) "security account" means

(A) a reinvestment account associated with a security, a securities account with a broker, a cash balance in a brokerage account, cash, cash equivalents, interest, earnings, or dividends earned or declared on a security in an account, a reinvestment account, or a brokerage account, whether or not credited to the account before the owner's death;

(B) a cash balance or other property held for or due to the owner of a security as a replacement for or product of an account security, whether or not credited to the account before the owner's death; or

(C) an investment management account, or a custody account, with a trust company or with a trust division of a bank with trust powers; this subparagraph includes, whether or not credited to the account before the owner's death,

(i) the securities in the account;

(ii) a cash balance in the account; and

(iii) cash, cash equivalents, interest, earnings, or dividends that are earned or declared on a security in the account;

(7) "TOD" means "transfer on death."

###### Sec. 13.33.302.   Registration in beneficiary form; sole or multiple ownership.

Only individuals whose registration of a security shows sole ownership by one individual or multiple ownership by two or more with right of survivorship, rather than as tenants in common, may obtain registration in beneficiary form. Multiple owners of a security registered in beneficiary form hold as joint tenants with right of survivorship, as tenants by the entirety, or as owners of community property held in survivorship form, and not as tenants in common.

###### Sec. 13.33.303.   Registration in beneficiary form; applicable law.

(a) A security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this or a similar TOD statute of the state of

(1) organization of the issuer or registering entity;

(2) the registering entity's principal office;

(3) the office of the registering entity's transfer agent or the registering entity's office making the registration; or

(4) the owner's address at the time of registration.

(b) A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this or similar TOD legislation is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law.

###### Sec. 13.33.304.   Origination of registration in beneficiary form.

A security, whether evidenced by certificate or account, is registered in beneficiary form when the registration includes a designation of a beneficiary to take the ownership at the death of the owner or the deaths of all multiple owners.

###### Sec. 13.33.305.   Form of registration in beneficiary form.

Registration in beneficiary form may be shown by the words "transfer on death" or the abbreviation "TOD," or by words "pay on death" or the abbreviation "POD," after the name of the registered owner and before the name of a beneficiary.

###### Sec. 13.33.306.   Effect, cancellation, and change of registration in beneficiary form.

The designation of a TOD beneficiary on a registration in beneficiary form does not have an effect on ownership until the owner's death. A registration of a security in beneficiary form may be canceled or changed at any time by the sole owner or all then surviving owners without the consent of the beneficiary.

###### Sec. 13.33.307.   Ownership on death of owner.

On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

###### Sec. 13.33.308.   Protection of registering entity.

(a) A registering entity is not required to offer or to accept a request for security registration in beneficiary form. If a registration in beneficiary form is offered by a registering entity, the owner requesting registration in beneficiary form assents to the protections given to the registering entity by AS 13.33.301§13.33.310.

(b) By accepting a request for registration of a security in beneficiary form, the registering entity agrees that the registration will be implemented on death of the deceased owner as provided in AS 13.33.301§13.33.310.

(c) A registering entity is discharged from all claims to a security by the estate, creditors, heirs, or devisees of a deceased owner if it registers a transfer of the security in accordance with AS 13.33.307 and does so in good faith reliance on

(1) the registration;

(2) AS 13.33.301§13.33.310; and

(3) information provided to it by affidavit of the personal representative of the deceased owner, or by the surviving beneficiary or by the surviving beneficiary's representatives, or other information available to the registering entity.

(d) The protections of AS 13.33.301§13.33.310 do not extend to a reregistration or payment made after a registering entity has received written notice from a claimant to any interest in the security objecting to implementation of a registration in beneficiary form. Other notice or other information available to the registering entity does not affect its right to protection under AS 13.33.301§13.33.310.

(e) The protection provided by AS 13.33.301§13.33.310 to the registering entity of a security does not affect the rights of beneficiaries in disputes between themselves and other claimants to ownership of the security transferred or its value or proceeds.

###### Sec. 13.33.309.   Nontestamentary transfer on death.

(a) A transfer on death resulting from a registration in beneficiary form is effective by reason of the contract regarding the registration between the owner and the registering entity and AS 13.33.301§13.33.310 and is not testamentary.

(b) AS 13.33.301§13.33.310 do not limit the rights of creditors of security owners against beneficiaries and other transferees under other laws of this state.

###### Sec. 13.33.310.   Terms, conditions, and forms for registration.

(a) A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests for registrations in beneficiary form and for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered TOD beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions established under this subsection may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary's descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary's death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for "lineal descendants per stirpes." This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary's descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary's domicile at the owner's death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity's terms and conditions.

(b) The following are illustrations of registrations in beneficiary form that a registering entity may authorize:

(1) sole owner-sole beneficiary: John S Brown TOD (or POD) John S Brown Jr.;

(2) multiple owners-sole beneficiary: John S Brown Mary B Brown JT TEN TOD John S Brown Jr.;

(3) multiple owners-primary and secondary (substituted) beneficiaries: John S Brown Mary B Brown JT TEN TOD John S Brown Jr. SUB BENE Peter Q Brown; or John S Brown Mary B Brown JT TEN TOD John S Brown Jr. LDPS.

## Chapter 35. Dower.

[Repealed,§30 ch 38 SLA 1963.]

#### Article 1. Trust Registration; Foreign Trustee Qualification.

## Chapter 36. Trust Administration.

###### Sec. 13.36.005.   Duty to register trusts.

(a) The trustee of a trust having its principal place of administration in this state shall register the trust in the court of this state at the principal place of administration. Unless otherwise designated in the trust instrument, the principal place of administration of a trust is the trustee's usual place of business where the records pertaining to the trust are kept, or at the trustee's residence if the trustee has no such place of business.  In the case of co-trustees, the principal place of administration, if not otherwise designated in the trust instrument, is

(1) the usual place of business of the corporate trustee if there is but one corporate co-trustee; or

(2) the usual place of business or residence of the individual trustee who is a professional fiduciary if there is but one such person and no corporate co-trustee; and otherwise

(3) the usual place of business or residence of any of the co-trustees as agreed upon by them.

(b) The duty to register under AS 13.36.005 §13.36.025 does not apply to the trustee of a trust if registration would be inconsistent with the retained jurisdiction of a foreign court from which the trustee cannot obtain release.

###### Sec. 13.36.010.   Registration procedures.

Registration shall be accomplished by filing a statement indicating the name and address of the trustee in which it acknowledges the trusteeship. The statement shall indicate whether the trust has been registered elsewhere. The statement shall identify the trust: (1) in the case of a testamentary trust, by the name of the testator and the date and place of domiciliary probate; (2) in the case of a written inter vivos trust, by the name of each settlor and the original trustee and the date of the trust instrument; or (3) in the case of an oral trust, by information identifying the settlor or other source of funds and describing the time and manner of the trust's creation and the terms of the trust, including the subject matter, beneficiaries and time of performance.  If a trust has been registered elsewhere, registration in this state is ineffective until either the earlier registration is released by order of the court where prior registration occurred or an instrument executed by the trustee and all beneficiaries is filed with the registration in this state.

###### Sec. 13.36.015.   Effect of registration.

(a) By registering a trust, or accepting the trusteeship of a registered trust, the trustee submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding under AS 13.36.035 relating to the trust that may be initiated by any interested person while the trust remains registered.  Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the trustee, or mailed by ordinary first-class mail to the trustee's address as listed in the registration or as thereafter reported to the court and to the trustee's address as then known to the petitioner.

(b) To the extent of their interests in the trust, all beneficiaries of a trust properly registered in this state are subject to the jurisdiction of the court of registration for the purposes of proceedings under AS 13.36.035, if notice is given under AS 13.06.110.

###### Sec. 13.36.020.   Effect of failure to register.

A trustee who fails to register a trust in a proper place as required by AS 13.36.005§13.36.025, for purposes of any proceedings initiated by a beneficiary of the trust before registration, is subject to the personal jurisdiction of any court in which the trust could have been registered. In addition, any trustee who, within 30 days after receipt of a written demand by a settlor or beneficiary of the trust, fails to register a trust as required by AS 13.36.005§13.36.025 is subject to removal under AS 13.36.076 and denial of compensation or to surcharge as the court may direct. A provision in the terms of the trust purporting to excuse the trustee from the duty to register, or directing that the trust or trustee is not subject to the jurisdiction of the court, is ineffective.

###### Sec. 13.36.025.   Qualification of foreign trustee.

(a) A foreign corporate trustee is required to qualify as a foreign corporation doing business in this state if it maintains the principal place of administration of any trust within the state.  A foreign co-trustee is not required to qualify in this state solely because its co-trustee maintains the principal place of administration in this state.  Unless otherwise doing business in this state, local qualification by a foreign trustee, corporate or individual, is not required in order for the trustee to receive distribution from a local estate or to hold, invest in, manage, or acquire property located in this state, or maintain litigation.  Nothing in this section affects a determination of what other acts require qualification as doing business in this state.

(b) The provisions of (a) of this section are not intended to override any provision of AS 06.26, and AS 06.26 governs to the extent of any conflict.

#### Article 2. Jurisdiction of Court Concerning Trusts; Choice of Law; Venue; Situs.

###### Sec. 13.36.035.   Court jurisdiction; choice of law.

(a) The court has exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings initiated by interested parties concerning the internal affairs of trusts, including trusts covered by (c) of this section. Except as provided in (c) and (d) of this section, proceedings that may be maintained under this section are those concerning the administration and distribution of trusts, the declaration of rights, and the determination of other matters involving trustees and beneficiaries of trusts. These include proceedings to

(1) appoint or remove a trustee under AS 13.36.076;

(2) review trustees' fees and to review and settle interim or final accounts;

(3) ascertain beneficiaries, determine any question arising in the administration or distribution of any trust including questions of construction of trust instruments, instruct trustees, and determine the existence or nonexistence of any immunity, power, privilege, duty, or right; and

(4) release registration of a trust.

(b) Neither registration of a trust nor a proceeding under this section results in continuing supervisory proceedings. The management and distribution of a trust estate, submission of accounts and reports to beneficiaries, payment of trustee's fees and other obligations of a trust, acceptance and change of trusteeship, and other aspects of the administration of a trust shall proceed expeditiously consistently with the terms of the trust, free of judicial intervention and without order, approval, or other action of any court, subject to the jurisdiction of the court as invoked by interested parties or as otherwise exercised as provided by law.

(c) A provision that the laws of this state govern the validity, construction, and administration of the trust and that the trust is subject to the jurisdiction of this state is valid, effective, and conclusive for the trust if

(1) some or all of the trust assets are deposited in this state and are being administered by a qualified person; in this paragraph, "deposited in this state" includes being held in a checking account, time deposit, certificate of deposit, brokerage account, trust company fiduciary account, or other similar account or deposit that is located in this state;

(2) a trustee is a qualified person who is designated as a trustee under the governing instrument or by a court having jurisdiction over the trust;

(3) the powers of the trustee identified under (2) of this subsection include or are limited to

(A) maintaining records for the trust on an exclusive basis or a nonexclusive basis; and

(B) preparing or arranging for the preparation of, on an exclusive basis or a nonexclusive basis, an income tax return that must be filed by the trust; and

(4) part or all of the administration occurs in this state, including physically maintaining trust records in this state.

(d) The validity, construction, and administration of a trust with a state jurisdiction provision are determined by the laws of this state, including the

(1) capacity of the settlor;

(2) powers, obligations, liabilities, and rights of the trustees and the appointment and removal of the trustees under AS 13.36.076; and

(3) existence and extent of powers, conferred or retained, including a trustee's discretionary powers, the powers retained by a beneficiary of the trust, and the validity of the exercise of a power.

(e)  [Repealed,§22 ch 105 SLA 1998.]

(f) Unless the laws of this state govern the validity, construction, and administration of the trust under (c) of this section, the laws of this state govern the administration of a trust and the courts of this state have exclusive jurisdiction over the trust and its trustees while the trust is administered in this state unless the governing instrument of the trust

(1) specifies that the law of a jurisdiction other than this state governs the administration of the trust;

(2) expressly prohibits a change in the choice of law for the administration of the trust; and

(3) expressly states that a change in the choice of law for the administration of the trust may not occur, even if a trustee from another jurisdiction becomes a trustee of the trust.

(g) In (f) of this section, a trust is considered to be administered in this state if

(1) the governing instrument of the trust specifies that the trust is to be administered in this state;

(2) the principal office of the trustee having custody of the trust's principal assets and records is located in this state, unless the trustee elects to maintain the administration of the trust in the state whose law is specified in the governing instrument to govern;

(3) the only trustee who is acting to administer the trust is a qualified person, unless the trustee elects to maintain the administration of the trust in the state whose law is specified in the governing instrument to govern;

(4) a majority of all trustees acting to administer the trust consists of qualified persons, unless a majority of the trustees elects to maintain the administration of the trust in the state whose law is specified in the governing instrument to govern; or

(5) a majority of the trustees are not qualified persons and a majority of the trustees, including at least one trustee who is a qualified person, executes an acknowledged instrument that this state shall be the primary place of administration for the trust.

(h) The trustee shall make the election in (g)(2)§(4) of this section by an instrument that is acknowledged and filed in a court of the state whose law is specified in the governing instrument to govern.

###### Sec. 13.36.040.   Trust proceedings; venue.

Venue for proceedings under AS 13.36.035 involving registered trusts is in the place of registration.  Venue for proceedings under AS 13.36.035 involving trusts not registered in this state is in any place where the trust properly could have been registered, and otherwise by the rules of civil procedure.

###### Sec. 13.36.043.   Change of situs to Alaska.

(a) The situs of a foreign trust is moved to this state when the trust satisfies the conditions listed in AS 13.36.035(c)(1)§(4) and a qualified person serving as trustee registers the trust under AS 13.36.010.

(b) If the situs of a foreign trust is moved to this state as provided in this section, a provision in the trust that restricts the transfer of trust assets in a manner similar to AS 34.40.110, that allows the trust to be perpetual, or that is not expressly prohibited by the law of this state is effective and enforceable under the laws of this state.

(c) A foreign trust that moves its situs to this state is valid whether or not the trust complied with the laws of this state at the time of its creation or after its creation.

(d) In this section, "foreign trust" means a trust that is created in another state or country and that is valid in that state or country.

###### Sec. 13.36.045.   Trust proceedings; matters relating to foreign trusts.

(a) The court will not, over the objection of a party, entertain proceedings under AS 13.36.035 involving a trust registered or having its principal place of administration in another state, unless

(1) all appropriate parties could not be bound by litigation in the courts of the state where the trust is registered or has its principal place of administration;

(2) the interests of justice otherwise would seriously be impaired; or

(3) the trust satisfies AS 13.36.035(c).

(b) The court may condition a stay or dismissal of a proceeding under this section on any party's consent to jurisdiction of the state in which the trust is registered or has its principal place of business, or the court may grant a continuance or enter any other appropriate order.

###### Sec. 13.36.050.   Concurrent jurisdiction; venue.

The court of the place in which the trust is registered has concurrent jurisdiction with other courts of this state of actions and proceedings to determine the existence or nonexistence of trusts created other than by will, of actions by or against creditors or debtors of trusts, and of other actions and proceedings involving trustees and third parties. Venue is determined by the rules generally applicable to civil actions.

###### Sec. 13.36.055.   Proceedings for review of employment of agents and review of compensation of trustee and employees of trust.

(a) On petition of an interested person, after notice to all interested persons, the court may review the propriety of employment of any person by a trustee including any attorney, auditor, investment advisor or other specialized agent or assistant, and the reasonableness of the compensation of any person so employed, and the reasonableness of the compensation determined by the trustee for the trustee's services.  Any person who has received excessive compensation from a trust may be ordered to make appropriate refunds.

(b) If the terms of a trust do not specify the compensation or method for determining the compensation of the trustee, the trustee is entitled to compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances. If the terms of a trust do not specify the compensation or method for determining the compensation of a person employed by the trustee, the person employed by the trustee is entitled to compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances. If the terms of a trust specify the compensation or method for determining the compensation of a trustee and if the trustee is compensated according to these terms, the compensation paid to the trustee is presumed to be reasonable. If the terms of a trust specify the compensation or method for determining the compensation of a person employed by the trustee and if the person employed by the trustee is compensated according to these terms, the compensation paid to the person employed by the trustee is presumed to be reasonable. If a trust specifies the compensation or method for determining the compensation paid to the trustee or person employed by the trustee and if the trustee or person employed by the trustee is compensated accordingly, an interested person who seeks review of the compensation has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the compensation paid to the trustee or the person employed by the trustee is not reasonable.

###### Sec. 13.36.060.   Trust proceedings; initiation by notice; necessary parties.

Proceedings under AS 13.36.035 are initiated by filing a petition in the court and giving notice under AS 13.06.110 to interested parties.  The court may order notification of additional persons.  A decree is valid as to all who are given notice of the proceeding though fewer than all interested parties are notified.

#### Article 3. Trustees.

###### Sec. 13.36.070.   General duty not limited.

Except as specifically provided, the general duty of the trustee to administer a trust expeditiously for the benefit of the beneficiaries is not altered by AS 13.06§AS 13.36.

###### Sec. 13.36.071.   Accepting or rejecting trusteeship.

(c) If a trustee is prohibited by (a) of this section from exercising a power and if one or more other trustees are not prohibited by (a) of this section from exercising the power, the other trustees may exercise the power. If there is not a trustee who can exercise a power prohibited under (a) of this section, a party in interest may apply to the superior court to appoint an independent trustee to exercise the power.

(d) The provisions of (a) of this section do not prohibit a trustee from making payments, including reimbursement of and compensation of an independent trustee appointed under (c) of this section, for the protection of the trust or the assets of the trust, or for the expenses, losses, or liabilities incurred in the collection, care, administration, or protection of the trust or the assets of the trust.

(e) Except as provided in (f) of this section, this section applies to

(1) a trust that is created on or after August 9, 2000; or

(2) the decisions and actions of a trust that is in existence on August 9, 2000, if the decisions are made, or the actions occur, on or after August 9, 2000.

(f) The application provisions of (e) of this section do not apply if

(1) the terms of the trust, including the terms as amended, expressly provide that this section does not apply and either specifically refer to this section or otherwise clearly demonstrate the intent that this section does not apply; or

(2) the trust is irrevocable and all parties in interest elect under (g) of this section not to be subject to the application of this section; an election under this paragraph must be made on or before January 1, 2003, or three years after the date on which the trust becomes irrevocable, whichever date is later; however, notwithstanding AS 13.36.080, the trustee does not have a duty to inform the parties in interest of this election.

(g) The election allowed under (f) of this section shall be made by a written declaration that is delivered to the trustee.

(h) The prohibitions of (a) of this section do not apply to a trustee with respect to trust property, including income from the trust property, if the trust property would, upon the death of the trustee, be included, for any reason other than the exercise of a power prohibited by (a) of this section, in the gross estate of the trustee for federal estate tax purposes.

(i) This section does not create a new cause of action, or impair a cause of action existing before August 9, 2000, if the new or existing cause of action relates to the exercise of a power prohibited by (a) of this section that was exercised before August 9, 2000.

(j) In this section, "independent trustee" means a trustee that is not related or subordinate, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 672(c), to the person having the power to remove the trustee or to any beneficiary.

###### Sec. 13.36.155.   Permitted sales between trusts held by same corporate trustee.

If the transaction is fair to both trusts and if the transaction is not prohibited by the instruments creating the trustee relationship, a corporate trustee may sell to itself as trustee of a trust the following held by the corporate trustee as trustee for another trust:

(1) stocks, bonds, and other securities listed on a securities exchange supervised by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission; and

(2) obligations of the United States treasury and obligations of United States government agencies.

###### Sec. 13.36.157.   Exercise of power of appointment.

(a) An authorized trustee with unlimited discretion to invade trust principal may appoint part or all of that principal to a trustee of an appointed trust for, and only for the benefit of, one or more current beneficiaries of the invaded trust to the exclusion of other current beneficiaries. A permissible appointee of a power of appointment held by a beneficiary of the appointed trust is not considered a beneficiary of the appointed trust, regardless of whether the permissible appointee is a current beneficiary or a successor and remainder beneficiary.

(b) An authorized trustee exercising the power under (a) of this section may grant a discretionary power of appointment, including a presently exercisable power of appointment, in the appointed trust to one or more of the current beneficiaries of the invaded trust, to the extent that the beneficiary who is granted the power to appoint is authorized to receive the principal outright under the terms of the invaded trust. A permissible appointee is not limited to the beneficiaries of the invaded trust.

(c) Under (a) and (b) of this section, if the beneficiaries of the invaded trust are described by a class, the beneficiaries of the appointed trust may include present or future members of that class.

(d) An authorized trustee with the power to invade trust principal but without unlimited discretion may appoint part or all of the principal of the trust to a trustee of an appointed trust if the current beneficiaries of the appointed trust are the same as the current beneficiaries of the invaded trust and the successor and remainder beneficiaries of the appointed trust are the same as the successor and remainder beneficiaries of the invaded trust. The shares of the current beneficiaries of the appointed trust must be the same as the shares of the current beneficiaries of the invaded trust, and the shares of the successor and remainder beneficiaries of the appointed trust must be the same as the shares of the successor and remainder beneficiaries of the invaded trust.

(e) If the authorized trustee exercises the power under (d) of this section, the appointed trust must include the same standard authorizing the trustee to distribute the income or invade the principal of the appointed trust as the standard in the invaded trust. However, the standard authorizing the trustee to distribute the income or invade the principal of the appointed trust may be changed if the trustee appoints to an appointed trust that is a special needs trust, a pooled trust, or a third-party trust.

(f) If an authorized trustee exercises the power under (d) and (e) of this section to extend the duration of the appointed trust beyond the duration of the invaded trust for any period after the invaded trust would have otherwise terminated under the provisions of the invaded trust, the appointed trust, in addition to the language required to be included in the appointed trust under (e) of this section, may also provide an additional trustee with unlimited discretion to invade the principal of the appointed trust during the extended duration. The trustee with unlimited discretion continues to be subject to the restrictions in (d)§(h) of this section.

(g) Under (d)§(f) of this section, if the beneficiaries of the invaded trust are described by a class, the beneficiaries of the appointed trust include present or future members of that class.

(h) If the authorized trustee exercises the power under (d)§(g) of this section and if the invaded trust grants a power of appointment to a beneficiary of the trust, the appointed trust must grant this power of appointment in the appointed trust, and the class of permissible appointees shall be the same as in the invaded trust.

###### Sec. 13.36.158.   Additional provisions relating to exercise of a power of appointment.

(a) An exercise of the power to invade trust principal under AS 13.36.157 is the exercise of a special power of appointment.

(b) The appointed trust to which an authorized trustee appoints the assets of the invaded trust under AS 13.36.157 may have a duration that is longer than the duration set out in the invaded trust.

(c) If an authorized trustee has unlimited discretion to invade the principal of a trust and if the same trustee or another trustee has a power, not dependent on unlimited discretion, to invade principal under the trust instrument, the authorized trustee having unlimited discretion may exercise the power of appointment under AS 13.36.157(a)§(c).

(d) An authorized trustee may exercise the power to appoint in favor of an appointed trust under AS 13.36.157 whether or not there is a current need to invade principal under the terms of the invaded trust.

(e) An authorized trustee exercising the power under AS 13.36.157§13.36.159 has a fiduciary duty to exercise the power in the best interests of one or more proper objects of the exercise of the power and as a prudent person would exercise the power under the prevailing circumstances. The authorized trustee may not exercise the power under AS 13.36.157§13.36.159 if there is substantial evidence of a contrary intent of the settlor and it cannot be established that the settlor would be likely to have changed this intention under the circumstances existing at the time the trustee exercises the power. The provisions of the invaded trust may not be viewed alone as substantial evidence of a contrary intent of the settlor unless the invaded trust expressly prohibits the exercise of the power in the manner intended by the authorized trustee.

(f) The provisions of AS 13.36.157§13.36.159 may not be construed to abridge the right of a trustee to appoint property further in trust under the terms of the governing instrument of a trust, another provision of law, or common law, or as directed by a court having jurisdiction over the trust.

(g) Nothing in AS 13.36.157§13.36.159 creates or implies a duty to exercise a power to invade principal. An inference of impropriety may not be made, and liability is not incurred, as a result of an authorized trustee not exercising the power conferred under AS 13.36.157.

(h) A power authorized by AS 13.36.157 may be exercised, subject to the provisions of AS 13.36.159(a), unless expressly prohibited by the terms of the governing instrument. A general prohibition against amending or revoking the invaded trust and a provision that constitutes a spendthrift clause do not preclude the exercise of a power under AS 13.36.157.

(i) An authorized trustee may not exercise a power authorized by AS 13.36.157 to

(1) reduce, limit, or modify a beneficiary's current right to a mandatory distribution of income or principal, a mandatory annuity or unitrust interest, a right to withdraw a percentage of the value of the trust, or a right to withdraw a specified dollar amount, if the mandatory right has come into effect with respect to the beneficiary, but the mandatory right may be reduced, limited, or modified during any extended duration of the trust; however, notwithstanding the other provisions in this paragraph, but subject to the other limitations in AS 13.36.157§13.36.159, an authorized trustee may exercise a power authorized by AS 13.36.157 to appoint to an appointed trust that is a special needs trust, a pooled trust, or a third-party trust;

(2) decrease or indemnify against a trustee's liability or exonerate a trustee from liability for failure to exercise reasonable care, diligence, and prudence unless the court having jurisdiction over the trust specifies otherwise;

(3) eliminate a provision granting another person the right to remove or replace the authorized trustee exercising the power under AS 13.36.157 unless a court having jurisdiction over the trust specifies otherwise;

(4) fix as binding and conclusive the value of an asset for purposes of distribution, allocation, or otherwise; or

(5) jeopardize

(A) the deduction or exclusion originally claimed with respect to a contribution to the invaded trust that qualified for the annual exclusion under 26 U.S.C. 2503(b), the marital deduction under 26 U.S.C. 2056(a) or 26 U.S.C. 2523(a), or the charitable deduction under 26 U.S.C. 170(a), 26 U.S.C. 642(c), 26 U.S.C. 2055(a), or 26 U.S.C. 2522(a) (Internal Revenue Code);

(B) the qualification of a transfer as a direct skip under 26 U.S.C. 2642(c) (Internal Revenue Code);

(C) the election to treat a corporation as a subchapter S corporation under 26 U.S.C. 1362 (Internal Revenue Code); or

(D) another specific tax benefit for which a contribution originally qualified for income, gift, estate, or generation-skipping transfer tax purposes under 26 U.S.C. (Internal Revenue Code).

(j) Before exercising the power under AS 13.36.157, an authorized trustee shall consider the tax implications of the exercise of the power.

(k) An authorized trustee may not exercise a power described in AS 13.36.157§13.36.159 in violation of the limitations on validity in AS 34.27.051 or 34.27.100, or the restrictions on exercising certain powers in AS 13.36.153 by trustees who are not independent. A violation voids the entire exercise of the power unless the exercise is modified to correct the violation.

(l) Unless a court having jurisdiction over the trust directs otherwise, an authorized trustee may not exercise a power authorized by AS 13.36.157 to change the provisions regarding the determination of the compensation of a trustee. The commissions or other compensation payable to the trustees of the invaded trust may continue to be paid to the trustees of the appointed trust during the term of the appointed trust and shall be determined in the same manner as for the invaded trust.

(m) A trustee may not receive a payment, a commission, or other compensation for appointing property from the invaded trust to an appointed trust under AS 13.36.157. However, a trustee may be compensated at a reasonable rate for the time spent considering and implementing the exercise of a power to appoint.

(n) Unless the invaded trust expressly provides otherwise, the provisions in AS 13.36.157§13.36.159 apply to

(1) a trust, whether testamentary or inter vivos, governed by the laws of this state, including a trust whose governing law has been changed to the laws of this state; and

(2) a trust that has a trustee who is an individual domiciled in this state, or a trustee that is an entity having an office in this state, if a majority of the trustees select this state as the location for the primary administration of the trust and the selection is made by an instrument in writing that is signed and acknowledged by a majority of the trustees; the instrument exercising this selection shall be kept with the records of the invaded trust.

(o) In this section, "Internal Revenue Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of the United States (26 U.S.C.) as it exists on September 9, 2013 and as it is amended from time to time.

###### Sec. 13.36.159.   Implementation of power of appointment.

(a) Unless the authorized trustee provides otherwise, the appointment of

(1) all of the assets making up the principal of the invaded trust to an appointed trust includes subsequently discovered assets of the invaded trust and undistributed principal of the invaded trust acquired after the appointment to the appointed trust;

(2) a part but not all of the assets making up the principal of the invaded trust to an appointed trust may not include subsequently discovered assets belonging to the invaded trust or principal paid to or acquired by the invaded trust after the appointment to the appointed trust; those subsequently discovered assets remain the assets of the invaded trust.

(b) The exercise of the power to appoint to an appointed trust under AS 13.36.157 shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing that is signed, dated, and acknowledged by the authorized trustee. The exercise of the power is effective 30 days after the date of service of the instrument as specified in (d) of this section, unless the persons entitled to notice consent in writing to a sooner effective date.

(c) An authorized trustee may exercise the power authorized by AS 13.36.157 without the consent of the settlor or a person interested in the invaded trust and without court approval. However, an authorized trustee may seek court approval for the exercise. When seeking court approval, notice shall be sent to all qualified beneficiaries.

(d) A copy of the invaded trust, the appointed trust, and the instrument exercising the power shall be delivered to

(1) the settlor, if living, of the invaded trust;

(2) a person having the right, under the terms of the invaded trust, to remove or replace the authorized trustee exercising the power under AS 13.36.157; and

(3) a qualified beneficiary or a person who may represent and bind a qualified beneficiary under AS 13.06.120.

(e) Notice under (d) of this section to a qualified beneficiary is not required if the settlor has exempted the authorized trustee from providing notification or information to beneficiaries under AS 13.36.080(b). Notice under (d) of this section shall be provided under AS 13.06.110.

(f) The instrument exercising the power must state whether the appointment is of all or part of the assets making up the principal of the invaded trust and, if a part, the approximate percentage of the value of the principal of the invaded trust that is the subject of the appointment. A failure to state whether the appointment is of all or part of the assets creates a presumption that only part of the assets is to be appointed.

(g) A person entitled to notice under (d) of this section may object to the trustee's exercise of the power under AS 13.36.157§13.36.159 by serving a written notice of objection on the trustee before the effective date of the exercise of the power. The failure to object does not constitute consent.

(h) The receipt of a copy of the instrument exercising the power does not, before the expiration of the limitation period in AS 13.36.100 with respect to a report disclosing the exercise, affect the right of a qualified beneficiary to object to the exercise of the power under AS 13.36.157 and to request the court to modify or to reverse the exercise.

(i) A copy of the instrument exercising the power shall be kept with the records of the invaded trust.

###### Sec. 13.36.160.   Corporate trustee buying its own or an affiliate's securities.

A corporate trustee may not purchase for a trust shares of its own stock, or its bonds, or other securities, or the stock, bonds, or other securities of an affiliate.

###### Sec. 13.36.165.   Withdrawals from mingled trust funds.

If a person who is a trustee of two or more trusts mingles the funds of two or more trusts in the same aggregate of cash or in the same bank or brokerage account or other investment, and if a withdrawal is made from the cash aggregate, account, or investment by the trustee for the trustee's own benefit, for the benefit of a third person who is not a beneficiary or creditor of one or more of the trusts, or for an unknown purpose, the withdrawal must be charged first to the amount of the personal cash, credit, or other property, if any, of the trustee in the mingled fund, and, after the exhaustion of the trustee's cash, credit, or other property, then to the several trusts in proportion to their several interests in the cash, credit, or other property in the cash aggregate, account, or investment at the time of the withdrawal. Nothing in this section is intended to authorize the mingling of trust funds.

###### Sec. 13.36.169.   Elections to qualify property for marital deduction and generation-skipping transfer tax allocations.

(a) Unless a governing instrument specifically refers to this section and provides otherwise, a trustee who makes an election under 26 U.S.C. 2056, 2056A, or 2523 (Internal Revenue Code), or who makes an allocation under 26 U.S.C. 2632 (Internal Revenue Code), may benefit personally from the election or allocation and is not required to reimburse another person interested in the election or allocation, to make an equitable adjustment, or to treat interested persons impartially with respect to the election or allocation.

(b) Unless a governing instrument specifically refers to this section and provides otherwise, if an election is made under 26 U.S.C. 2056, 2056A, or 2523 (Internal Revenue Code), if an allocation is made under 26 U.S.C. 2632 (Internal Revenue Code), or if division of a trust benefits the persons interested in the trust, the trustee may divide the trust into two or more separate trusts of equal or unequal value if the terms of the separate resulting trusts are substantially identical to the terms of the trust before the division. The allocation of assets must be based on the fair market value of the assets at the time of the division.

(c) Except as provided in (d) of this section, this section applies to

(1) a trust that is created on or after August 9, 2000; or

(2) the decisions and actions of a trust that is in existence on August 9, 2000 if the decisions are made or actions occur on or after August 9, 2000.

(d) The application provisions of (c) of this section do not apply if

(1) the terms of the trust, including the terms as amended, expressly provide that this section does not apply and either specifically refer to this section or otherwise clearly demonstrate the intent that this section does not apply; or

(2) the trust is irrevocable and all parties in interest elect not to be subject to the application of this section; an election under this paragraph must be made on or before January 1, 2003, or three years after the date on which the trust becomes irrevocable, whichever date is later; however, notwithstanding AS 13.36.080, the trustee does not have a duty to inform the parties in interest of this election; the election allowed under this paragraph must be made by a written declaration delivered to the trustee.

###### Sec. 13.36.170.   Unenforceable oral trust created by deed.

(a) When an interest in real property is conveyed by deed to a person in a trust that is unenforceable under AS 09.25.010§09.25.020 and the intended trustee or the trustee's successor in interest holds title but refuses to carry out the trust because of AS 09.25.010§09.25.020, the intended trustee or the trustee's successor in interest, except to the extent that the successor in interest is a bona fide purchaser of a legal interest in the real property, shall convey the interest in real property to the settlor or the settlor's successor in interest. A court having jurisdiction may prescribe the conditions for conveying the interest to the settlor or the settlor's successor in interest.

(b) If the intended trustee of an unenforceable trust under (a) of this section transfers part or all of the trustee's interest and the interest is transferred to a bona fide purchaser, the intended trustee is liable to the settlor or the settlor's successor in interest for the value, at the time of the transfer, of the interest transferred, less any offsets that a court determines to be equitable.

###### Sec. 13.36.175.   Action on contract against trustee in representative capacity.

(a) When a trustee makes a contract that is within the trustee's powers as trustee or when a predecessor trustee has made a contract within the predecessor trustee's powers as trustee and a cause of action arises on the contract, the party in whose favor the cause of action has accrued may collect the judgment by execution on the trust property.

(b) In an action under this section, the plaintiff is not required to prove that the trustee could have been reimbursed from the trust fund if the trustee had paid the plaintiff's claim.

(c) A beneficiary or, in the case of a charitable trust, the attorney general and a corporation that is a beneficiary or agent in the performance of the charitable trust, may intervene in an action under this section and contest the right of the plaintiff to recover.

(d) A judgment may not be rendered in favor of the plaintiff in an action under this section unless the plaintiff proves that, within 30 days after the beginning of the action or within another period set by the court and more than 30 days before obtaining the judgment, the plaintiff has notified each of the beneficiaries who is known to the trustee and who then has a present interest in the existence and nature of the action, or, in the case of a charitable trust, the attorney general of this state and a corporation that is a beneficiary or agent in the performance of the charitable trust. The notice shall be given by mailing copies of the notice with postage prepaid to the beneficiaries at their last known addresses. The trustee shall furnish the plaintiff with a list of names and addresses of the beneficiaries within 10 days after the plaintiff makes a written demand for the list. Notification of the persons on the list constitutes compliance with the duty placed on the plaintiff by this section.

(e) The plaintiff in an action under this section may also hold the trustee who made the contract personally liable on the contract if the contract does not exclude the trustee's personal liability. In a contract action under this section, the addition of the word "trustee" or the words "as trustee" after the signature of a trustee to a contract creates a presumption, which may only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence otherwise, of an intent to exclude the trustee from personal liability, and, unless the presumption is rebutted, the trustee is not personally liable under the contract.

###### Sec. 13.36.180.   Exoneration or reimbursement for tort.

(a) A trustee who has incurred personal liability for a tort committed in the administration of the trust is entitled to exoneration for the liability from the trust property if the trustee has not discharged the claim, or to reimbursement for the liability out of trust funds if the trustee has paid the claim, if the trustee or an officer or employee of the trustee was not guilty of personal fault in incurring the liability.

(b) If a trustee has incurred personal liability for a tort committed in the administration of the trust and that tort increases the value of the trust property, the trustee is entitled to exoneration or reimbursement to the extent of the increase in value as a result of the tort even though the trustee would not otherwise be entitled to exoneration or reimbursement.

(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to change the existing law with regard to the liability of trustees of charitable trusts for torts of the trustees or their employees.

###### Sec. 13.36.185.   Tort liability of trust.

(a) If a trustee or a predecessor of the trustee incurs personal liability for a tort committed in the course of the trustee's administration, the trustee in the trustee's representative capacity may be sued and collection made from the trust property if the court determines in the tort action that

(1) the trustee or the trustee's predecessor, or an officer or employee of the trustee or the trustee's predecessor, was not guilty of personal fault in incurring the liability; or

(2) although the tort does not fall under (1) of this subsection, the tort increased the value of the trust property.

(b) If the tort is within (a)(1) of this section, the full amount of proven damages may be collected from the trust property.

(c) If the tort is within (a)(2) of this section, collection may not be made from the trust property except to the extent of the increase in the value of the trust property.

(d) A beneficiary may intervene in an action under this section and contest the right of the plaintiff to recover.

(e) In an action against the trustee in the trustee's representative capacity under this section, the plaintiff is not required to prove that the trustee could have secured reimbursement from the trust fund if the trustee paid the plaintiff's claim.

(f) A judgment may not be rendered in favor of the plaintiff in an action under this section unless the trustee proves that within 30 days after the beginning of the action, or within another period set by the court and more than 30 days before obtaining the judgment, the trustee notifies each of the beneficiaries who is known to the trustee who then has a present interest in the existence and nature of the action. The notice shall be given by mailing copies of the notice with postage prepaid to the beneficiaries at their last known addresses. The trustee shall furnish the plaintiff with a list of names and addresses of the beneficiaries within 10 days after the plaintiff makes a written demand for the list. Notification of the persons on the list constitutes compliance with the duty placed on the plaintiff by this subsection.

(g) Nothing in this section may be construed to change the existing law with regard to the liability of trustees of charitable trusts for torts of the trustees or their employees.

###### Sec. 13.36.190.   Personal liability for tort committed by trustee.

A trustee may be held personally liable for a tort committed by the trustee, or by the trustee's agents or employees in the course of their agency or employment, subject to the rights of exoneration or reimbursement under AS 13.36.180.

###### Sec. 13.36.192.   Power of settlor of trust.

(a) The settlor of a trust affected by AS 13.36.105§13.36.220 may, by provision in the instrument creating the trust if the trust is created by a writing, by oral statement to the trustee at the time of the creation of the trust if the trust is created orally, or by an amendment of the trust if the settlor reserved the power to amend the trust,

(1) relieve the trustee from any or all of the duties, restrictions, and liabilities that would otherwise be imposed on the trustee by AS 13.36.105§13.36.220;

(2) alter or deny to the trustee any or all of the privileges and powers conferred on the trustee by AS 13.36.105§13.36.220; or

(3) add duties, restrictions, liabilities, privileges, or powers, to those imposed or granted by AS 13.36.105§13.36.220.

(b) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, an act of the settlor may not relieve a trustee from the duties, restrictions, and liabilities imposed on the trustee by AS 13.36.140, 13.36.145, or 13.36.150.

###### Sec. 13.36.194.   Power of beneficiary of trust.

A beneficiary of a trust affected by AS 13.36.105§13.36.220 may, if the beneficiary has full legal capacity and acts on full information, by written instrument delivered to the trustee, relieve the trustee, as regards the beneficiary, from any or all of the duties, restrictions, and liabilities that would otherwise be imposed on the trustee by AS 13.36.105§13.36.220, except for the duties, restrictions, and liabilities imposed by AS 13.36.140§13.36.150. The beneficiary may release the trustee from liability to the beneficiary for past violations of AS 13.36.105§13.36.220.

###### Sec. 13.36.196.   Relieving trustee of duties, restrictions, and liability; power of the court.

A court of competent jurisdiction may, for cause shown and on notice to the beneficiaries, relieve a trustee from any or all of the duties and restrictions that would otherwise be placed on the trustee by AS 13.36.105§13.36.220 or wholly or partly excuse a trustee who has acted honestly and reasonably from liability for violations of AS 13.36.105§13.36.220.

###### Sec. 13.36.198.   Consequences of violations.

If a trustee violates a provision of AS 13.36.105§13.36.220, the trustee may be removed as trustee under AS 13.36.076 and denied compensation in whole or in part, and a beneficiary, co-trustee, or successor trustee may treat the violation as a breach of trust.

(1) engaging in an act of self-dealing, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 4941(d) (Internal Revenue Code of 1954), that would give rise to liability for the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 4941(a) (Internal Revenue Code of 1954);

(b) If a trust or a property transfer to a trust is voided or set aside under AS 34.40.110(b), then the trust or property transfer shall be voided or set aside only to the extent necessary to satisfy the settlor's debt to the creditor or other person at whose instance the trust or property transfer is voided or set aside and the costs and attorney fees allowed under the rules of court.

## Chapter 38. Alaska Principal and Income Act.

#### Article 1. Preliminary Provisions; Power to Adjust.

###### Secs. 13.38.010 §13.38.140.   [Repealed,§4 ch 145 SLA 2003.]

###### Sec. 13.38.200.   Fiduciary duties; general principles.

(a) In allocating receipts and disbursements to or between principal and income and with respect to any matter within the scope of this chapter, a fiduciary

(1) shall administer a trust or estate in accordance with the governing instrument, even if there is a different provision in this chapter;

(2) may administer a trust or estate by the exercise of a discretionary power of administration regarding a matter within the scope of this chapter given to the fiduciary by the governing instrument, even if the exercise of the power produces a result different from a result required or permitted by this chapter; an inference that the fiduciary has improperly exercised the discretionary power does not arise from the fact that the fiduciary has made an allocation contrary to a provision of this chapter;

(3) shall administer a trust or estate in accordance with this chapter if the governing instrument does not contain a different provision or does not give the fiduciary a discretionary power of administration regarding a matter within the scope of this chapter; and

(4) shall add a receipt or charge a disbursement to principal to the extent that the governing instrument and this chapter do not provide a rule for allocating the receipt or disbursement to or between principal and income.

(b) In exercising a discretionary power of administration regarding a matter within the scope of this chapter, whether granted by the governing instrument or this chapter, including AS 13.38.210 and 13.38.300§13.38.435, a fiduciary shall administer a trust or estate impartially based on what is fair and reasonable to all of the beneficiaries, except to the extent that the governing instrument clearly manifests an intention that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more of the beneficiaries. A determination in accordance with this chapter is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all of the beneficiaries.

###### Sec. 13.38.210.   Trustee's power to adjust.

(a) Subject to (c) and (f) of this section, a trustee may adjust between principal and income by allocating an amount of income to principal or an amount of principal to income to the extent the trustee considers appropriate if

(1) the governing instrument describes what may or shall be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to the trust's income;

(2) the trustee determines, after applying the rules in AS 13.38.200(a), that the trustee is unable to comply with AS 13.38.200(b); and

(3) the trustee determines to follow an investment policy seeking a total return for the investments held by the trust, whether the return is to be derived from

(A) appreciation of capital;

(B) earnings and distributions from capital; or

(C) both (A) and (B) of this paragraph.

(b) In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power conferred by (a) of this section, a trustee may consider, among other things,

(1) the size of the trust;

(2) the nature and estimated duration of the trust;

(3) the liquidity and distribution requirements of the trust;

(4) the need for regular distributions and preservation and appreciation of capital;

(5) the expected tax consequences of an adjustment;

(6) the net amount allocated to income under the other sections of this chapter and the increase or decrease in the value of the principal assets, which the trustee may estimate as to assets for which market values are not readily available;

(7) the assets held in the trust; the extent to which the assets consist of financial assets, interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, or real property; the extent to which an asset is used by a beneficiary; and whether an asset was purchased by the trustee or received from the settlor or testator;

(8) to the extent reasonably known to the trustee, the need of the beneficiaries for present and future distributions authorized or required by the governing instrument;

(9) whether and to what extent the governing instrument gives the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate income or prohibits the trustee from invading principal or accumulating income, and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income;

(10) the intent of the settlor or testator; and

(11) the actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income and the effects of inflation and deflation.

(c) A trustee may not make an adjustment under this section if

(1) the adjustment would diminish the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which a federal estate tax or gift tax marital deduction would be allowed, in whole or in part, if the trustee did not have the power to make the adjustment; the prohibition in this paragraph does not apply to a trust after the trustee determines that the marital deduction has not been claimed or has not been allowed;

(2) the adjustment would reduce the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust to which a person transfers property with the intent to qualify for a federal gift tax exclusion;

(3) the adjustment would change the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets;

(4) the adjustment is from any amount that is permanently set aside for charitable purposes under the governing instrument and for which a federal estate or gift tax charitable deduction has been taken, unless both income and principal are permanently set aside for charitable purposes under the governing instrument;

(5) possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment would cause an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for federal income tax purposes, and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;

(6) possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment would cause all or part of the trust assets to be subject to federal estate or gift tax with respect to an individual, and the assets would not be subject to federal estate or gift tax with respect to the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;

(7) the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust; or

(8) the trust has been converted to a unitrust under AS 13.38.300§13.38.435.

(d) If (c)(5), (6), or (7) of this section applies to a trustee and there is more than one trustee, a co-trustee to whom the provision does not apply may make the adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or trustees is prohibited by the governing instrument.

(e) A trustee may release the entire power conferred by (a) of this section, the power to adjust from income to principal, or the power to adjust from principal to income if the trustee is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in (c)(1)§(6) of this section, or if the trustee determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in (c) of this section. The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual.

(f) A governing instrument that limits the power of a trustee to make an adjustment between principal and income does not affect the application of this section unless it is clear from the governing instrument that it is intended to deny the trustee the power of adjustment conferred by (a) of this section.

###### Sec. 13.38.220.   Judicial control of discretionary powers.

(a) A court may not change a fiduciary's decision to exercise or not to exercise a discretionary power conferred by this chapter unless the court determines that the decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.

(b) If a court determines that a fiduciary has abused the fiduciary's discretion regarding a discretionary power conferred by this chapter, the remedy is to restore the income and remainder beneficiaries to the positions they would have occupied if the fiduciary had not abused the fiduciary's discretion, according to the following rules:

(1) to the extent that the abuse of discretion has not resulted in a distribution to a beneficiary or has resulted in a distribution that is too small, the court shall require the fiduciary to distribute from the trust an amount to the beneficiary that the court determines will restore the beneficiary, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary's appropriate position;

(2) to the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in a distribution to a beneficiary that is too large, the court shall restore the beneficiaries, the trust, or both, in whole or in part, to their appropriate positions by requiring the fiduciary to withhold an amount from one or more future distributions to the beneficiary who received the distribution that was too large or by requiring that beneficiary or that beneficiary's estate to return some or all of the distribution to the trust, notwithstanding a spendthrift or similar provision;

(3) if the abuse of discretion concerns the power to convert a trust into a unitrust, the court shall require the trustee either to convert into a unitrust or to reconvert from a unitrust;

(4) to the extent that the court is unable, after applying (1)§(3) of this subsection, to restore the beneficiaries, the trust, or both to the positions they would have occupied if the fiduciary had not abused the fiduciary's discretion, the court may require the fiduciary to pay an appropriate amount from the fiduciary's own funds to one or more of the beneficiaries, the trust, or both.

#### Article 2. Unitrusts.

###### Sec. 13.38.300.   Power to convert to unitrust.

Unless expressly prohibited by the governing instrument, a trustee may release the power to adjust under AS 13.38.210 and may convert a trust into a unitrust as described in AS 13.38.300§13.38.435 if

(1) the trustee determines that the conversion will enable the trustee to better carry out the intent of the settlor or testator and the purposes of the trust;

(2) the trustee gives written notice of the trustee's intention to release the power to adjust, of the trustee's intention to convert the trust into a unitrust, of the unitrust percentage selected, of the smoothing period selected, and of how the unitrust will operate, including what initial decisions the trustee intends to make under AS 13.38.340, to all the sui juris beneficiaries who

(A) are currently eligible to receive income from the trust;

(B) would be eligible, if a power of appointment were not exercised, to receive income from the trust if the interest of all of the beneficiaries eligible to receive income under (A) of this paragraph were to terminate immediately before the giving of the notice; and

(C) would, if a power of appointment were not exercised, receive a distribution of principal if the trust were to terminate immediately before the giving of the notice;

(3) there are at least one sui juris beneficiary under (2)(A) of this section and at least one sui juris beneficiary under (2)(B) or (C) of this section; and

(4) a sui juris beneficiary does not object to the conversion to a unitrust in a writing delivered to the trustee within 60 days after the mailing of the notice under (2) of this section.

###### Sec. 13.38.310.   Judicially approved conversion; beneficiary request for conversion.

(a) A trustee may petition the court to approve the conversion to a unitrust if

(1) a beneficiary timely objects to the conversion to a unitrust;

(2) there is not a sui juris beneficiary who is currently eligible under AS 13.38.300(2)(A) or who would be eligible under AS 13.38.300(2)(B) or (C); or

(3) the trustee is a beneficiary.

(b) A beneficiary may request a trustee to convert to a unitrust. If the trustee does not convert, the beneficiary may petition the superior court to order the conversion.

(c) The superior court shall approve the conversion or direct the requested conversion if the court concludes that the conversion will enable the trustee to better carry out the intent of the settlor or testator and the purposes of the trust.

###### Sec. 13.38.320.   Factors to be considered.

In deciding whether to exercise the power conferred by AS 13.38.300, a trustee may consider, among other things,

(1) the size of the trust;

(2) the nature and estimated duration of the trust;

(3) the liquidity and distribution requirements of the trust;

(4) the need for regular distributions and preservation and appreciation of capital;

(5) the expected tax consequences of the conversion;

(6) the assets held in the trust; the extent to which they consist of financial assets, interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, or real property; and the extent to which an asset is used by a beneficiary;

(7) to the extent reasonably known to the trustee, the need of the beneficiaries for present and future distributions authorized or required by the governing instrument;

(8) whether and to what extent the governing instrument gives the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate income or prohibits the trustee from invading principal or accumulating income and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income;

(9) the actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income and the effects of inflation and deflation.

###### Sec. 13.38.330.   Directions after conversion.

(a) After a trust is converted to a unitrust, the trustee shall

(1) follow an investment policy seeking a total return for the investments held by the trust, whether the return is to be derived from

(A) appreciation of capital;

(B) earnings and distributions from capital; or

(C) both (A) and (B) of this paragraph; and

(2) make regular distributions in accordance with the governing instrument construed in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(b) After a trust has been converted to a unitrust, "income" in the governing instrument means an annual distribution equal to the amount produced by the application of a fixed unitrust percentage established under (d) of this section to the net fair market value, as determined annually, of the trust's assets, whether the assets would be considered income or principal under other provisions of this chapter, averaged over the lesser of

(1) the preceding years in the smoothing period selected by the trustee; or

(2) the period during which the trust has been in existence.

(c) [Repealed,§46 ch 45 SLA 2013.]

(d) The unitrust percentage to be used in determining the amount to be distributed from a unitrust to a beneficiary must be a reasonable current return from the unitrust of at least three percent and not more than five percent, taking into account the intentions of the trustor of the unitrust as expressed in the governing instrument, the needs of the beneficiaries, general economic conditions, projected current earnings for the unitrust, projected appreciation for the unitrust, and the effect of projected inflation on the unitrust.

###### Sec. 13.38.340.   Trustee's discretionary powers regarding unitrust.

The trustee may, in the trustee's discretion, from time to time, determine

(1) the effective date of a conversion to a unitrust;

(2) the provisions for prorating a unitrust distribution for a short year in which a beneficiary's right to payments commences or ceases;

(3) the frequency of unitrust distributions during the year;

(4) the effect of other payments from or contributions to the trust on the trust's valuation;

(5) whether to value the trust's assets annually or more frequently;

(6) whether to use a smoothing period of three, four, or five years;

(7) what valuation dates to use;

(8) how frequently to value nonliquid assets and whether to estimate their value;

(9) whether to omit trust property occupied or possessed by a beneficiary from the calculations; and

(10) other matters necessary for the proper functioning of the unitrust.

###### Sec. 13.38.350.   Unitrust deductions and distributions.

(a) Expenses that would be deducted from income if the trust were not a unitrust may not be deducted from the unitrust distribution.

(b) Unless otherwise provided by the governing instrument, a unitrust distribution shall be considered to have been paid from net income as net income would be determined if the trust were not a unitrust. To the extent net income is insufficient, the unitrust distribution shall be considered to have been paid from ordinary income that is allocable under federal income tax rules to net income as determined for a unitrust. To the extent that the ordinary income is insufficient, the unitrust distribution is considered to have been paid from net realized short-term capital gains. To the extent net income, ordinary income, and net realized short-term capital gains are insufficient, the unitrust distribution shall be considered to have been paid from net realized long-term capital gains. To the extent net income, ordinary income, and net realized short-term and long-term capital gains are insufficient, the unitrust distribution shall be paid from the principal of the trust.

###### Sec. 13.38.360.   Court orders regarding unitrust.

The trustee or, if the trustee declines to petition the court, a beneficiary may petition the court to provide for a distribution of net income, as would be determined if the unitrust were not a unitrust, in excess of the unitrust distribution if the distribution is necessary to preserve a tax benefit.

###### Sec. 13.38.370.   Effects of conversion.

A conversion to a unitrust does not affect a provision in the governing instrument directing or authorizing the trustee to distribute principal or authorizing a beneficiary to withdraw a portion or all of the principal.

###### Sec. 13.38.380.   Prohibited conversions; exception.

(a) A trustee may not convert a trust into a unitrust if

(1) payment of the unitrust distribution would change the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets;

(2) the unitrust distribution would be made from an amount that is permanently set aside for charitable purposes under the governing instrument and for which a federal estate or gift tax deduction has been taken;

(3) possessing or exercising the power to convert would cause an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for federal income tax purposes, and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the power to convert;

(4) possessing or exercising the power to convert would cause all or part of the trust assets to be subject to federal estate or gift tax with respect to an individual, and the assets would not be subject to federal estate or gift tax with respect to the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to convert;

(5) the conversion would result in the disallowance of a federal estate tax or gift tax marital deduction that would be allowed if the trustee did not have the power to convert; or

(6) the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust.

(b) Notwithstanding (a)(2) of this section, a trustee may elect to convert a trust to a unitrust if both the income and principal of the trust being converted to a unitrust are permanently set aside for charitable purposes and if the provisions of AS 13.38.440§13.38.490 are followed.

###### Sec. 13.38.390.   Permissible conversion where otherwise prohibited.

(a) If AS 13.38.380(a)(3), (4), or (6) applies to a trustee and there is more than one trustee, a co-trustee to whom the provision does not apply may convert the trust, unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee is prohibited by the governing instrument.

(b) If AS 13.38.380(a)(3), (4), or (6) applies to all the trustees, the trustees may petition the court to direct a conversion. In the alternative, the trustees may appoint an independent person who shall be granted the authority, while acting in a fiduciary capacity, to make decisions in place of the trustees relating to a conversion, reconversion, and the exercise of discretionary powers under AS 13.38.340.

###### Sec. 13.38.400.   Reconversion from a unitrust.

A trustee may reconvert a trust that has been converted into a unitrust under AS 13.38.300 by following the same procedures provided in AS 13.38.300§13.38.435 for converting a trust into a unitrust. If a unitrust is reconverted under this section, the trustee's power to adjust under AS 13.38.210 applies to the trustee after the reconversion.

###### Sec. 13.38.410.   Release of power to convert to unitrust.

(a) A trustee may release the power conferred by AS 13.38.300 to convert to a unitrust if the trustee

(1) is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in AS 13.38.380(a)(3), (4), or (5); or

(2) determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in AS 13.38.380.

(b) The release of a power under (a) of this section may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual.

###### Sec. 13.38.420.   Express total return unitrusts.

(a) This section applies to a trust that, by its governing instrument, requires the distribution, at least annually, of a unitrust amount.

(b) The trustee of an express total return unitrust may determine the unitrust amount by reference to the net fair market value of the unitrust's assets in one or more years.

(c) Distribution of a unitrust amount is considered a distribution of all of the income of an express total return unitrust and is considered to be an income interest.

(d) Distribution of a unitrust amount is considered to be a reasonable apportionment of the total return of an express total return unitrust.

(e) An express total return unitrust that provides for a distribution based on a unitrust percentage in excess of five percent of the net fair market value of the unitrust assets a year is considered a distribution of all of the income of the unitrust and a distribution of principal of the unitrust to the extent that the distribution exceeds five percent a year.

(f) The governing instrument of an express total return unitrust may grant discretion to the trustee to adopt a consistent practice of treating capital gains as part of the unitrust amount to the extent that the unitrust amount exceeds the income determined as if the trust were not an express total return unitrust, or the governing instrument may specify the ordering of classes of income.

(g) Unless the terms of the express total return unitrust specifically provide otherwise, a unitrust amount is considered a distribution made from the following sources, which are listed in order of priority:

(1) net income determined as if the trust were not a unitrust;

(2) ordinary income not allocable to net income;

(3) net realized short-term capital gains;

(4) net realized long-term capital gains; and

(5) the principal of the trust estate.

(h) The governing instrument of an express total return unitrust may provide that the trustee may exclude assets used by the unitrust's beneficiary, including a residence property or tangible personal property, from the net fair market value of the unitrust's assets for the purposes of computing the unitrust amount. These assets may be considered equivalent to income or to the unitrust amount.

(i) In this section,

(1) "express total return unitrust" means a trust that, by its governing instrument, requires the distribution, at least annually, of a unitrust amount;

(2) "unitrust amount" means an amount equal to a fixed percentage of not less than three nor more than five percent each year of the net fair market value of the annual value of the trust's assets distributed from an express total return unitrust to a beneficiary.

###### Sec. 13.38.430.   Power to treat gains as part of distribution of principal.

Unless prohibited by the unitrust's governing instrument or specifically addressed by AS 13.38.350 or 13.38.420, the trustee of a unitrust may treat gains from the sale of capital assets of the unitrust as part of a distribution of principal to a beneficiary, and, if the trustee treats those gains as part of a distribution of principal to a beneficiary, the trustee shall treat those gains consistently on the unitrust's books, records, and tax returns as part of a distribution to a beneficiary.

###### Sec. 13.38.435.   Definitions.

In AS 13.38.300§13.38.435,

(1) "smoothing period" means the period of years over which the fair market value of the assets of a unitrust are averaged;

(2) "unitrust percentage" means the unitrust percentage established under AS 13.38.330(d).

#### Article 3. Charitable Trust Election.

###### Sec. 13.38.440.   Charitable trust election.

The trustee of a trust held exclusively for charitable purposes may elect to be governed by AS 13.38.440§13.38.490 unless the governing instrument expressly provides that the election provided by AS 13.38.440§13.38.490 is not available.

###### Sec. 13.38.450.   Requirements for making election.

To make an election under AS 13.38.440§13.38.490, the trustee shall adopt and follow an investment policy seeking a total return for the investments held by the trust, whether the return is to be derived from appreciation of capital or earnings and distributions with respect to capital or both. The policy constituting the election must be in writing, must be maintained as part of the permanent records of the trust, and must recite that it constitutes an election to be governed by AS 13.38.440§13.38.490.

###### Sec. 13.38.460.   Selection of percentage after charitable trust election.

(a) After a trustee has elected under AS 13.38.440 for the trust to be governed by AS 13.38.440§13.38.490, the trustee shall, in a writing maintained as part of the permanent records of the trust, select the percentage of the value of the trust that will be considered income and determine that it is consistent with the long-term preservation of the real value of the principal of the trust, but the percentage may not be less than two percent or more than seven percent each year of the principal value of the trust. The trustee may elect to change a percentage whenever the trustee determines that the new percentage is necessary and prudent.

(b) For a charitable trust required by 26 U.S.C. 4942 (Internal Revenue Code) to distribute a higher amount than the percentage selected under (a) of this section, the amount required by 26 U.S.C. 4942 (Internal Revenue Code) controls over the percentage selected.

###### Sec. 13.38.470.   Revocation of charitable trust election.

The trustee may revoke an election to be governed by AS 13.38.440§13.38.490 if the revocation is made as part of an alternative investment policy seeking the long-term preservation of the real value of the principal of the trust. The revocation and alternative investment policy must be in writing and maintained as part of the permanent records of the trust.

###### Sec. 13.38.480.   Value determination.

For the purposes of applying AS 13.38.440§13.38.490, the value of the trust is the fair market value of the cash and other assets held by the trustee with respect to the trust, whether these assets would be considered income or principal under the other provisions of this chapter, determined at least annually. In the discretion of the trustee, the value of the trust may be averaged over a period of three or more preceding years, except that, if the trust has been in existence less than three years and the trustee decides to average the value, the average shall be determined over the period during which the trust has been in existence.

###### Sec. 13.38.490.   Definitions.

In AS 13.38.440§13.38.490, except as otherwise expressly stated in AS 13.38.440§13.38.490,

(1) "income" means the percentage of the value of the trust computed under AS 13.38.440§13.38.490;

(2) "principal" means all assets other than those identified as income in (1) of this section that are held by the trustee with respect to the trust.

#### Article 4. Decedent's Estate or Terminating Income Interest.

###### Sec. 13.38.500.   Determination and distribution of net income.

After a decedent dies in the case of an estate, or after an income interest in a trust ends, a fiduciary

(1) of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary under (5) of this section and the provisions applicable to trustees in AS 13.38.550§13.38.860; the fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to receive the specific property;

(2) shall distribute to a beneficiary or trust that receives a pecuniary amount a share of net income equal to the beneficiary's or trust's fractional interest in undistributed principal assets as determined under AS 13.38.510(a), (b)(1), (b)(3), and (c)§(e); the share accrues from the date of death of a decedent, in the case of an estate, or the date of death of a settlor or specified event, in the case of a revocable or irrevocable trust;

(3) shall determine the remaining net income of a decedent's estate or a terminating income interest under the provisions applicable to trustees in AS 13.38.550§13.38.860 and by

(A) including in net income all income from property used to discharge liabilities; and

(B) paying from principal the debts, the funeral expenses, the costs of disposition of remains, the family allowance under AS 13.12.404, fees of personal representatives and their attorneys and accountants, and the taxes, related interest, and penalties described in AS 13.38.810(a)(7) that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the governing instrument or applicable law;

(4) shall distribute the net income remaining after distributions required by (2) of this section in the manner described in AS 13.38.510 to all other beneficiaries;

(5) may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in (1) of this section because of a payment described in AS 13.38.800 or 13.38.810 to the extent that the governing instrument or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party; the net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by

(A) including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event; and

(B) making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.

###### Sec. 13.38.510.   Distribution to residuary and remainder beneficiaries.

(a) Each beneficiary described in AS 13.38.500(4) is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the distribution date. If a fiduciary makes more than one distribution of assets to beneficiaries to whom this section applies, each beneficiary, including one who does not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to the net income the fiduciary has received after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date but has not distributed as of the current distribution date.

(b) In determining a beneficiary's share of net income, the following rules apply:

(1) the beneficiary is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets immediately before the distribution date, including assets that later may be sold or applied to meet principal obligations;

(2) the beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets shall be calculated without regard to property specifically given to a beneficiary and property required to pay pecuniary amounts;

(3) the beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets shall be calculated on the basis of the aggregate value of those assets as of the distribution date without reducing the value by any unpaid principal obligation.

(c) If a fiduciary does not distribute all of the collected but undistributed net income to each person as of a distribution date, the fiduciary shall maintain appropriate records showing the interest of each beneficiary in that net income.

(d) To the extent that the fiduciary considers it appropriate, if this section applies to the income from an asset, the fiduciary may apply the rules in this section to net gain or loss from the disposition of a principal asset realized after the date of death or terminating event or an earlier distribution date.

(e) For the purposes of this section, the distribution date may be the date as of which the fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on which assets are actually distributed.

#### Article 5. Allocation and Payment at Beginning and End of Income Interest.

###### Sec. 13.38.550.   When right to income begins and ends.

(a) An income beneficiary is entitled to net income from the date on which the income interest begins. An income interest begins

(1) on the date specified in the governing instrument; or

(2) if a date is not specified, on the date an asset becomes subject to a trust or successive income interest.

(b) An asset becomes subject to a trust on the date

(1) it is transferred to the trust, in the case of an asset that is transferred to a trust during the transferor's life;

(2) of a testator's death, in the case of an asset that becomes subject to a trust by reason of a will, even if there is an intervening period of administration of the testator's estate; or

(3) of an individual's death, in the case of an asset that is transferred to a fiduciary by a third party because of the individual's death.

(c) An asset becomes subject to a successive income interest on the day after the preceding income interest ends, as determined under (d) of this section, even if there is an intervening period of administration to wind up the preceding income interest.

(d) An income interest ends on

(1) the day before an income beneficiary dies or another terminating event occurs; or

(2) the last day of a period during which there is not a beneficiary to whom a trustee may distribute income.

###### Sec. 13.38.560.   Allocation of receipts and disbursements when decedent dies or income interest begins.

(a) Unless AS 13.38.500(1) applies, a trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement to principal if its due date occurs before

(1) a decedent dies, in the case of an estate; or

(2) an income interest begins, in the case of a trust or successive income interest.

(b) A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement to income if its due date occurs on or after the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins and its due date is periodic. An income receipt or disbursement shall be treated as accruing from day to day if its due date is not periodic or it does not have a due date. The portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins shall be allocated to principal, and the balance shall be allocated to income.

(c) An item of income or an obligation is due on the date the payor is required to make a payment. If a payment date is not stated, there is not a due date for the purposes of this chapter. Distributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity to which AS 13.38.600 applies are considered to be due on the date fixed by the entity for determining who is entitled to receive the distribution or, if a date is not fixed, on the declaration date for the distribution. A due date is periodic for receipts or disbursements that must be paid at regular intervals under a lease or an obligation to pay interest or if an entity customarily makes distributions at regular intervals.

###### Sec. 13.38.570.   Payment when income interest ends.

(a) When a mandatory income interest ends, the trustee shall pay to a mandatory income beneficiary who survives that date, or the estate of a deceased mandatory income beneficiary whose death causes the interest to end, the beneficiary's share of the undistributed income that is not disposed of under the governing instrument unless the beneficiary has an unqualified power to revoke more than five percent of the trust immediately before the income interest ends. In the case of the beneficiary who has an unqualified power to revoke more than five percent of the trust immediately before the income interest ends, the undistributed income from the portion of the trust that may be revoked shall be added to principal.

(b) When a trustee's obligation to pay a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust's assets ends, the trustee shall prorate the final payment if and to the extent required by applicable law to accomplish a purpose of the trust or its settlor or testator relating to income, gift, estate, or other tax requirements.

(c) In this section, "undistributed income" means net income received before the date on which an income interest ends, but does not include an item of income or expense that is due or accrued or net income that has been added or is required to be added to principal under the governing instrument.

#### Article 6. Allocation of Receipts during Administration of Trust.

###### Sec. 13.38.600.   Allocation of property from entities.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a trustee shall allocate to income money received from an entity, including reinvested cash dividends.

(b) A trustee shall allocate the following receipts from an entity to principal:

(1) property other than money excluding reinvested cash dividends;

(2) money received in one distribution or a series of related distributions in exchange for part or all of a trust's interest in the entity;

(3) money received in total or partial liquidation of the entity;

(4) money received from an entity that is a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust if the money distributed is a short-term or long-term capital gain dividend for federal income tax purposes.

(c) Money is received in partial liquidation

(1) to the extent that the entity, at or near the time of a distribution, indicates that it is a distribution in partial liquidation; or

(2) if the total amount of money and property received in a distribution or series of related distributions is greater than 20 percent of the entity's gross assets, as shown by the entity's year-end financial statements immediately preceding the initial receipt.

(d) Money is not received in partial liquidation, and it may not be taken into account under (c)(2) of this section, to the extent that it does not exceed the amount of income tax that a trustee or beneficiary must pay on taxable income of the entity that distributes the money.

(e) A trustee may rely upon a statement made by an entity about the source or character of a distribution if the statement is made at or near the time of distribution by the entity's board of directors or other person or group of persons authorized to exercise powers to pay money or transfer property comparable to those of a corporation's board of directors.

(f) In this section, "entity" means a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, common trust fund, or another organization in which a trustee has an interest, but does not include

(1) a trust or estate to which AS 13.38.610 applies;

(2) a business or activity to which AS 13.38.620 applies;

(3) a payment to which AS 13.38.690 applies; or

(4) an asset-backed security to which AS 13.38.750 applies.

###### Sec. 13.38.610.   Distribution from trust or estate.

(a) A trustee shall allocate to income an amount received as a distribution of income from a trust or an estate in which the trust has an interest other than a purchased interest.

(b) A trustee shall allocate to principal an amount received as a distribution of principal from a trust or estate in which the trust has an interest other than a purchased interest.

(c) If a trustee purchases an interest in a trust that is an investment entity, or a decedent or donor transfers an interest in a trust that is an investment entity to a trustee, AS 13.38.600 or 13.38.750 applies to a receipt from the trust.

###### Sec. 13.38.620.   Business and other activities conducted by trustee.

(a) If a trustee that conducts a business or other activity determines that it is in the best interest of all the beneficiaries to account separately for the business or other activity instead of accounting for it as part of the trust's general accounting records, the trustee may maintain separate accounting records for the transactions of the business or other activity, whether or not the assets of the business or other activity are segregated from other trust assets.

(b) A trustee who accounts separately for a business or other activity may determine the extent to which

(1) its net cash receipts are retained for working capital, the acquisition or replacement of fixed assets, and other reasonably foreseeable needs of the business or activity; and

(2) the remaining net cash receipts are accounted for as principal or income in the trust's general accounting records.

(c) If a trustee sells assets of the business or other activity, other than in the ordinary course of the business or activity, the trustee shall account for the net amount received as principal in the trust's general accounting records to the extent the trustee determines that the amount received is not required any longer in the conduct of the business.

(d) Activities for which a trustee may maintain separate accounting records include

(1) retail, manufacturing, service, and other traditional business activities;

(2) farming;

(3) raising and selling livestock and other animals;

(4) management of rental properties;

(5) extraction of minerals and other natural resources;

(6) timber operations; and

(7) activities to which AS 13.38.740 applies.

###### Sec. 13.38.630.   Principal receipts.

A trustee shall allocate to principal any of the following:

(1) to the extent not allocated to income under this chapter, assets received from

(A) a transferor during the transferor's lifetime;

(C) a trust with a terminating income interest; or

(D) a payor under a contract naming the trust or its trustee as beneficiary;

(2) money or other property received from a principal asset's sale, exchange, liquidation, or change in form, including realized profit subject to AS 13.38.600§13.38.750;

(3) amounts recovered from third parties to reimburse the trust because of disbursements described in AS 13.38.810(a)(8) or for other reasons, to the extent not based on the loss of income, except that a separate award made for the loss of income with respect to an accounting period during which a current income beneficiary had a mandatory income interest is income;

(4) net income received in an accounting period during which there is not a beneficiary to whom a trustee may or must distribute income;

(5) other receipts as provided in AS 13.38.680§13.38.750.

###### Sec. 13.38.640.   Rental property.

(a) To the extent that a trustee accounts for receipts from rental property under this section, the trustee shall allocate an amount received as rent of real or personal property to income, including an amount received for cancellation or renewal of a lease.

(b) An amount received as a refundable deposit, including a security deposit or a deposit that is to be applied as rent for future periods,

(1) shall be added to principal;

(2) shall be held subject to the terms of the lease; and

(3) is not available for distribution to a beneficiary until the trustee's contractual obligations have been satisfied with respect to that amount.

###### Sec. 13.38.650.   Obligation to pay money.

(a) An amount received as interest, whether determined at a fixed, variable, or floating rate, on an obligation to pay money to the trustee, including an amount received as consideration for prepaying principal, shall be allocated to income without any provision for amortization of premium.

(b) A trustee shall allocate to principal an amount received from the sale, redemption, or other disposition of an obligation to pay money to the trustee more than one year after it is purchased or acquired by the trustee, including an obligation if the purchase price or value of the obligation when it is acquired is less than its value at maturity. If the obligation matures within one year after it is purchased or acquired by the trustee, an amount received in excess of its purchase price or its value when acquired by the trust shall be allocated to income.

(c) This section does not apply to an obligation to which AS 13.38.690, 13.38.700, 13.38.710, 13.38.720, 13.38.730, 13.38.740, or 13.38.750 applies.

###### Sec. 13.38.660.   Insurance policies and similar contracts.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in (b) or (c) of this section, a trustee shall allocate to principal the proceeds of a life insurance policy or other contract in which the trust or its trustee is named as beneficiary, including a contract that insures the trust or its trustee against loss for damage to, destruction of, or loss of title to a trust asset. If the premiums on the policy or contract are paid from income, the trustee shall allocate dividends on the policy or contract to income. If the premiums on the policy or contract are paid from principal, the trustee shall allocate dividends on the policy or contract to principal.

(b) Except as provided in (c) of this section, a trustee shall allocate to income proceeds of a contract that insures the trustee against

(1) loss of occupancy or other use by an income beneficiary;

(2) loss of income; or

(3) subject to AS 13.38.620, loss of profits from a business.

###### Sec. 13.38.670.   Special rules for charitable remainder unitrusts.

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, if a charitable remainder unitrust, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 664 (Internal Revenue Code), owns an obligation described in (2) of this section, the following rules apply, unless varied by the governing instrument:

(1) an obligation for the payment of money is principal at its inventory value except as provided in (2) of this section; the trustee may not make a provision for amortization of a premium or for accumulation for discount;

(2) except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, an increase in the value of the following above inventory value is distributable as income:

(A) a zero coupon bond;

(B) an annuity contract before annuitization;

(C) a life insurance contract before the death of the insured;

(D) an interest in a common trust fund; in this subparagraph, "common trust fund" has the meaning given in 26 U.S.C. 584 (Internal Revenue Code);

(E) an interest in a limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or limited partnership; and

(F) another obligation for the payment of money if the money is payable at a future time under a fixed, variable, or discretionary schedule of appreciation and if the payment exceeds the price at which the obligation was issued;

(3) the increase in value of the obligations described in (2) of this section is distributable to the beneficiary who was the income beneficiary at the time of the increase; the increase is distributable from the first cash available from the principal or, if cash is not available from the principal, when cash is first available from the principal due to a sale, a redemption, or another disposition; when an unrealized increase is distributed as income from principal, the principal shall be reimbursed when the increase is realized;

(4) the increase in value of an obligation described in (2) of this section is not available for distribution unless the trustee receives cash on account of the obligation;

(5) notwithstanding a provision in this section to the contrary, a distribution from a partnership or limited liability company attributable to the cash flow or income derived from operations regularly carried on by the partnership or limited liability company is income, except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument.

###### Sec. 13.38.680.   Insubstantial allocations not required.

If a trustee determines that an allocation between principal and income required by AS 13.38.690, 13.38.700, 13.38.710, 13.38.720, or 13.38.750 is insubstantial, the trustee may allocate the entire amount to principal unless one of the circumstances described in AS 13.38.210(c) applies to the allocation. This power may be exercised by a co-trustee in the circumstances described in AS 13.38.210(d) and may be released for the reasons and in the manner described in AS 13.38.210(e). An allocation is presumed to be insubstantial if

(1) the amount of the allocation would increase or decrease net income in an accounting period, as determined before the allocation, by less than five percent; or

(2) the value of the asset producing the receipt for which the allocation would be made is less than five percent of the total value of the trust's assets at the beginning of the accounting period.

###### Sec. 13.38.690.   Retirement benefits, individual retirement accounts, deferred compensation, annuities, and similar payments.

(a) A trustee shall allocate

(1) to income that portion of a payment that equals the greater of the following:

(A) the portion that the payor characterizes as interest, a dividend, a remittance in place of interest, or a remittance in place of a dividend; or

(B) the portion that is characterized as imputed interest for federal income tax purposes;

(2) to principal that portion of a payment that remains after the allocation is made under (1) of this subsection.

(b) If no part of a payment under a contract calling for equal installments over a fixed period of time is allocable to income under the provisions of (a) of this section, the difference between the trust's acquisition value of the contract and the total expected return is considered to be interest. The trustee shall allocate to income the portion of each payment equivalent to interest on the then unpaid principal balance at the rate specified in the contract or at a rate necessary to amortize the difference between the expected return and the acquisition value, where that rate is readily ascertainable by the trustee.

(c) If no portion of a payment from a separate fund held exclusively for the benefit of the trust is allocable to income under (a) or (b) of this section, but the internal net income of the fund determined as if the fund were a separate trust subject to AS 13.38.200§13.38.410, 13.38.500§13.38.690, or 13.38.710§13.38.860 is readily ascertainable by the trustee, the internal net income of the fund is considered to be the income earned by the fund, and the portion of the payment equal to the then undistributed net income of the fund realized since the trust acquired its interest in the fund is considered to be a distribution of that internal net income of the fund and shall be allocated to the trust income account. The balance of the payment described in this subsection shall be allocated to principal. The power to adjust under AS 13.38.210, the power to convert to a unitrust under AS 13.38.300, and the provisions of AS 13.38.420 apply to retirement benefits covered by this subsection that are payable to a trust. Those powers and provisions may be exercised by the payee trustee or in the governing instrument for the retirement benefits separately and independently from the exercise by the payee trustee or in the governing instrument of those powers and provisions for the trust, as if the retirement benefits and the trust were separate trusts subject to this chapter.

(d) A trustee shall allocate 10 percent of the part of the payment that is required to be made during the accounting period to income and the balance to principal if there is no part of the payment that is allocable to income under (a)§(c) of this section and all or part of the payment is required to be made. The trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal if no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled. In this subsection, a payment is not "required to be made" to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal.

(e) If, to obtain a federal estate or gift tax marital deduction for a trust, the trustee must allocate more of a payment to income than provided for by this section, the trustee shall allocate to income the additional amount necessary to obtain the marital deduction.

(f) This section does not apply to payments to which AS 13.38.700 applies.

(g) In this section, "payment" means a payment that a trustee may receive over a fixed period of time or during the life of one or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payor in exchange for future payments, and includes

(1) a payment made in money or property from the payor's general assets or from a separate fund created by the payor or another person;

(2) a payment on or from

(A) an installment contract or note;

(B) a private or commercial annuity;

(C) a deferred compensation agreement;

(D) an employee death benefit;

(E) an individual retirement account; or

(F) a pension plan, profit-sharing plan, stock plan, bonus plan, or stock-ownership plan.

###### Sec. 13.38.700.   Liquidating assets.

(a) A trustee shall allocate 10 percent of the receipts from a liquidating asset to income and the balance to principal.

(b) In this section, "liquidating asset"

(1) means

(A) an asset the value of which will diminish or terminate because the asset is expected to produce receipts for a period of limited duration; or

(B) a leasehold, patent, copyright, royalty right, and right to receive payments during a period of more than one year under an arrangement that does not provide for the payment of interest on the unpaid balance;

(2) does not include

(A) an obligation subject to AS 13.38.670;

(B) a payment subject to AS 13.38.690;

(C) resources subject to AS 13.38.710;

(D) timber subject to AS 13.38.720;

(E) an activity subject to AS 13.38.740;

(F) an asset subject to AS 13.38.750; or

(G) an asset for which the trustee establishes a reserve for depreciation under AS 13.38.830.

###### Sec. 13.38.710.   Minerals, water, and other natural resources.

(a) To the extent that a trustee accounts for receipts from an interest in minerals or other natural resources under this section, the trustee shall allocate them as follows:

(1) if received as nominal delay rent or nominal annual rent on a lease, a receipt shall be allocated to income;

(2) if received from a production payment, a receipt shall be allocated to income if and to the extent that the agreement creating the production payment provides a factor for interest or its equivalent; the balance shall be allocated to principal;

(3) if an amount received as a royalty, shut-in-well payment, take-or-pay payment, bonus, or delay rental is more than nominal, 90 percent shall be allocated to principal, and the balance shall be allocated to income;

(4) if an amount is received from a working interest or any other interest not provided for in (1)§(3) of this subsection, 90 percent of the net amount received shall be allocated to principal, and the balance shall be allocated to income.

(b) An amount received on account of an interest in renewable water shall be allocated to income. An amount received on account of an interest in nonrenewable water shall be allocated as follows:

(1) 90 percent of the amount shall be allocated to principal; and

(2) the balance shall be allocated to income.

(c) This chapter applies whether or not a decedent or donor was extracting minerals, water, or other natural resources before the interest became subject to the trust.

###### Sec. 13.38.720.   Timber.

(a) To the extent that a trustee accounts for receipts from the sale of timber and related products under this section, the trustee shall allocate the net receipts

(1) to income, to the extent that the amount of timber removed from the land does not exceed the rate of growth of the timber during the accounting periods in which a beneficiary has a mandatory income interest;

(2) to principal, to the extent that the amount of timber removed from the land exceeds the rate of growth of the timber, or the net receipts are from the sale of standing timber;

(3) between income and principal, by determining the amount of timber removed from the land under the lease or contract and applying the rules in (1) and (2) of this subsection if the net receipts are from the lease of timberland or a contract to cut timber from land owned by a trust;

(4) to principal to the extent that advance payments, bonuses, and other payments are not allocated under (1)§(3) of this subsection.

(b) In determining net receipts to be allocated under (a) of this section, a trustee shall deduct and transfer to principal a reasonable amount for depletion.

(c) This chapter applies whether or not a decedent or transferor was harvesting timber from the property before it became subject to the trust.

###### Sec. 13.38.730.   Property not productive of income; marital deduction.

(a) If a federal estate or gift tax marital deduction is allowed for all or part of a trust whose income is required to be paid to the settlor's or testator's spouse and whose assets consist substantially of property that does not provide the spouse with sufficient income from or use of the trust assets, and if the amounts that the trustee transfers from principal to income under AS 13.38.210 and that the trustee distributes to the spouse from principal under the governing instrument are insufficient to provide the spouse with the beneficial enjoyment required to obtain the marital deduction, the spouse may require the trustee to make property productive of income, convert property within a reasonable time, or exercise the power conferred by AS 13.38.210(a). The trustee may decide which action or combination of actions to take. The income interest for a marital deduction trust described in this subsection shall be paid at least annually.

(b) In cases not governed by (a) of this section, proceeds from the sale or other disposition of an asset are principal without regard to the amount of income the asset produces during any accounting period.

(c) Unless otherwise provided by the trust instrument, a power or authority granted to a trustee, except for the authority to refrain from electing qualified terminal interest property treatment under 26 U.S.C. 2056 or 2523 (Internal Revenue Code), does not prevent a qualifying trust from being eligible for the marital deduction. All powers granted to a trustee shall be construed consistently with this subsection. In this subsection, "qualifying trust" means a trust

(1) that is designated in the trust instrument as a trust eligible for the federal estate or gift tax marital deduction; or

(2) if it can be inferred from the trust instrument that the grantor intended the trust to be eligible for the federal estate or gift tax marital deduction.

###### Sec. 13.38.740.   Derivatives and options.

(a) To the extent that a trustee does not account under AS 13.38.620 for transactions in derivatives, the trustee shall allocate receipts from and disbursements made in connection with those transactions to principal.

(b) If a trustee grants an option to buy property from the trust, whether or not the trust owns the property when the option is granted, grants an option that permits another person to sell property to the trust, or acquires an option to buy property for the trust or an option to sell an asset owned by the trust, and the trustee or other owner of the asset is required to deliver the asset if the option is exercised, an amount received for granting the option shall be allocated to principal. An amount paid to acquire the option shall be paid from principal. A gain or loss realized upon the exercise of an option, including an option granted to a settlor or testator of the trust for services rendered, shall be allocated to principal.

(c) In this section, "derivative" means a contract or financial instrument or a combination of contracts and financial instruments that gives a trust the right or obligation to participate in some or all changes in the price of a tangible or intangible asset or group of assets, or changes in a rate, an index of prices or rates, or another market indicator for an asset or a group of assets.

###### Sec. 13.38.750.   Asset-backed securities.

(a) If a trust receives a payment from interest or other current return and from other proceeds of the collateral financial assets, the trustee shall allocate the portion of the payment that the payor identifies as being from interest or other current return to income, and the trustee shall allocate the balance of the payment to principal.

(b) If a trust receives one or more payments in exchange for the trust's entire interest in an asset-backed security in one accounting period, the trustee shall allocate the payments to principal.

(1) means an asset whose value is based on the right it gives the owner to receive distributions from the proceeds of financial assets that provide collateral for the security;

(b) A custodian is not personally liable

(1) on a contract properly entered into in the custodial capacity unless the custodian fails to reveal that capacity and to identify the custodianship in the contract; or

(2) for an obligation arising from control of custodial property or for a tort committed during the custodianship unless the custodian is personally at fault.

If the event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred and a substitute custodian able, willing, and eligible to serve was not nominated under AS 13.46.020, the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute custodian under AS 13.46.020; otherwise the transferor or the transferor's legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property under AS 13.46.080(a).  The custodian so designated has the rights of a successor custodian.

(b) A custodian at any time may designate a trust company or an adult other than a transferor under AS 13.46.030 as successor custodian by executing and dating an instrument of designation before a subscribing witness other than the successor.

(2) within 90 days after receiving the custodian's notice under (b) of this section.

(d) If a minor does not exercise the minor's right to compel distribution under (c) of this section, the custodial term shall be extended as indicated in the custodian's notice given under (b) of this section, and the minor may not compel the immediate distribution of custodial property before the end of the custodial term, as extended.

(b) An adult may execute a durable power of attorney for health care, which may authorize the agent to make any health care decision the principal could have made while having capacity. The power remains in effect notwithstanding the principal's later incapacity and may include individual instructions. The power must be in writing, contain the date of its execution, be signed by the principal, and be witnessed by one of the following methods:

(1) signed by at least two individuals who are personally known by the principal, each of whom witnessed either the signing of the instrument by the principal or the principal's acknowledgment of the signature of the instrument; or

(2) acknowledged before a notary public at a place in this state.

(c) Unless related to the principal by blood, marriage, or adoption, an agent under a durable power of attorney for health care may not be an owner, operator, or employee of the health care institution at which the principal is receiving care.

(d) A witness for a durable power of attorney for health care may not be

(1) a health care provider employed at the health care institution or health care facility where the principal is receiving health care;

(2) an employee of the health care provider providing health care to the principal, or of the health care institution or health care facility where the principal is receiving health care; or

(3) the agent.

(e) At least one of the individuals used as a witness for a durable power of attorney for health care shall be someone who is not

(1) related to the principal by blood, marriage, or adoption; or

(2) entitled to a portion of the estate of the principal upon the principal's death under a will or codicil of the principal existing at the time of execution of the durable power of attorney for health care or by operation of law then existing.

(f) Unless otherwise specified in the durable power of attorney for health care, the authority of an agent becomes effective only upon a determination that the principal lacks capacity and ceases to be effective upon a determination that the principal has recovered capacity.

(g) Unless otherwise specified in a written advance health care directive, a determination that a principal lacks or has recovered capacity, or that another condition exists that affects an individual instruction or the authority of an agent, shall be made by

(1) the primary physician, except in the case of mental illness;

(3) the primary physician or another health care provider in the case of mental illness where the situation is an emergency.

(h) An agent shall make a health care decision in accordance with the principal's individual instructions, if any, and other wishes to the extent known to the agent.

In determining the principal's best interest, the agent shall consider the principal's personal values to the extent known to the agent.

(i) A health care decision made by an agent for a principal is effective without judicial approval.

(j) A written advance health care directive may include the individual's nomination of a guardian of the individual.

(k) Except as provided in AS 13.52.247(a), an advance health care directive, including an advance health care directive that is made in compliance with the laws of another state, is valid for purposes of this chapter if it complies with this chapter, regardless of where or when it was executed or communicated.

###### Sec. 13.52.020.   Revocation of advance health care directive.

(a) Except in the case of mental illness under (c) of this section, a principal may revoke the designation of an agent only by a signed writing or by personally informing the supervising health care provider.

(b) Except in the case of mental illness under (c) of this section and except as provided by AS 13.52.183, a principal may revoke all or part of an advance health care directive, other than the designation of an agent, at any time and in any manner that communicates an intent to revoke.

(c) In the case of mental illness, an advance health care directive may be revoked in whole or in part at any time by the principal if the principal does not lack capacity and is competent. A revocation is effective when a competent principal with capacity communicates the revocation to a physician or other health care provider. The physician or other health care provider shall note the revocation on the principal's medical record. In the case of mental illness, the authority of a named agent and an alternative agent named in the advance health care directive continues in effect as long as the advance health care directive appointing the agent is in effect or until the agent has withdrawn. For the purposes of this subsection, a principal is not considered competent when

(1) it is the opinion of the court in a guardianship proceeding under AS 13.26, the opinion of two physicians, at least one of whom is a psychiatrist, or the opinion of a physician and a professional mental health clinician, that the principal is not competent; or

(2) a court in a hearing under AS 47.30.735, 47.30.750, or 47.30.770 determines that the principal is gravely disabled; in this paragraph, "gravely disabled" has the meaning given in AS 47.30.915(9)(B).

###### Sec. 13.52.025.   Rescission of withdrawal by agent.

A person who has withdrawn as an agent may rescind the withdrawal by executing an acceptance after the date of the withdrawal. A person who rescinds a withdrawal shall give notice to the principal if the principal has capacity or to the principal's health care provider if the principal does not have capacity.

###### Sec. 13.52.030.   Surrogates.

(a) Except in the case of mental health treatment and except as provided by AS 13.52.173 and 13.52.193, a surrogate may make a health care decision for a patient who is an adult if an agent or guardian has not been appointed or the agent or guardian is not reasonably available, and if the patient has been determined by the primary physician to lack capacity.

(A) two physicians, one of whom is a psychiatrist; or

(B) a physician and a professional mental health clinician.

(c) Except as provided for anatomical gifts in AS 13.52.173, an adult may designate an individual to act as surrogate for that adult by personally informing the supervising health care provider.

(2) an adult child;

(3) a parent; or

(4) an adult sibling.

(d) Except as provided by (l) of this section or AS 13.52.173 or 13.52.193, if none of the individuals eligible to act as surrogate under (c) of this section is reasonably available, an adult who has exhibited special care and concern for the patient, who is familiar with the patient's personal values, and who is reasonably available may act as surrogate.

(e) A surrogate shall communicate the surrogate's assumption of authority as promptly as practicable to the health care provider, the health care institution, and the members of the patient's family specified in (c) of this section who can be readily contacted.

(f) If more than one member of a class under (c)(2)§(4) of this section assumes authority to act as surrogate, the members of that class do not agree on a health care decision, and the supervising health care provider is informed of the disagreement, the supervising health care provider shall comply with the decision of a majority of the members of that class who have communicated their views to the provider. If the class is evenly divided concerning the health care decision and the supervising health care provider is informed of the even division, that class and all individuals having a lower priority under (c)(2)§(4) of this section are disqualified from making the decision, and the primary physician, after consulting with all individuals in that evenly divided class who are reasonably available, shall make a decision based on the consultation and the primary physician's own determination of the best interest of the patient.

(g) A surrogate shall make a health care decision in accordance with the patient's individual instructions or other advance health care directives, if any, and other wishes to the extent known to the surrogate.

(i) A health care decision made by a surrogate for a patient is effective without judicial approval.

(j) A patient who has capacity may, at any time, disqualify another person, including a member of the patient's family, from acting as the patient's surrogate by a signed writing or by personally informing the supervising health care provider of the disqualification.

(k) Unless related to the patient by blood, marriage, or adoption, a surrogate may not be an owner, operator, or employee of the health care facility where the patient is receiving care.

(l) A supervising health care provider may require an individual claiming the right to act as a surrogate for a patient to provide a written declaration under penalty of perjury stating facts and circumstances reasonably sufficient to establish the claimed authority.

###### Sec. 13.52.040.   Decisions by guardian.

(a) Subject to AS 13.52.183, 13.52.193, and 13.52.203, a guardian shall comply with the ward's individual instructions and may not revoke a ward's advance health care directive executed before the ward's incapacity unless a court expressly authorizes the revocation.

(b) Unless there is a court order to the contrary, a health care decision of an agent takes precedence over that of a guardian.

(c) Except as provided in (a) of this section, a health care decision made by a guardian for the ward is effective without judicial approval.

###### Sec. 13.52.045.   Withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining procedures.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an agent or a surrogate may determine that life-sustaining procedures may be withheld or withdrawn from a patient with a qualifying condition when there is

(1) a durable power of attorney for health care or other writing that clearly expresses the patient's intent that the procedures be withheld or withdrawn; or

(2) no durable power of attorney for health care or other writing that clearly expresses the patient's intent to the contrary, the patient has a qualifying condition as determined under AS 13.52.160, and withholding or withdrawing the procedures would be consistent with the patient's best interest.

###### Sec. 13.52.050.   Decisions for exceptional procedures.

Unless there is a durable power of attorney for health care or another writing clearly expressing an individual's intent to the contrary, an agent or surrogate may not consent on behalf of a patient to an abortion, sterilization, psychosurgery, or removal of bodily organs except when the abortion, sterilization, psychosurgery, or removal of bodily organs is necessary to preserve the life of the patient or to prevent serious impairment of the health of the patient.

###### Sec. 13.52.055.   Pregnancy.

(a) Before implementing a health care decision for a woman of childbearing age that would affect a fetus if present, the supervising health care provider shall take reasonable steps to determine whether the woman is pregnant.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, an advance health care directive by a patient or a decision by the person then authorized to make health care decisions for a patient may not be given effect if

(1) the patient is a woman who is pregnant and lacks capacity;

(2) the directive or decision is to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining procedures;

(3) the withholding or withdrawal of the life-sustaining procedures would, in reasonable medical judgment, be likely to result in the death of the patient; and

(c) A supervising health care provider who makes or is informed of a determination that a patient lacks or has recovered capacity, or that another condition exists that affects an individual instruction or the authority of an agent, a guardian, or a surrogate, shall promptly record the determination in the patient's health care record and communicate the determination to the patient, if possible, and to any person then authorized to make health care decisions for the patient.

A health care institution or health care facility may decline to comply with an individual instruction or health care decision if the instruction or decision is contrary to a policy of the institution or facility that is expressly based on reasons of conscience and if the policy was timely communicated to the patient or to a person then authorized to make health care decisions for the patient.

(f) A health care provider, health care institution, or health care facility may decline to comply with an individual instruction or a health care decision that requires medically ineffective health care or health care contrary to generally accepted health care standards applicable to the provider, institution, or facility. In this subsection, "medically ineffective health care" means health care that according to reasonable medical judgment cannot cure the patient's illness, cannot diminish its progressive course, and cannot effectively alleviate severe discomfort and distress.

(g) A health care provider, health care institution, or health care facility that declines to comply with an individual instruction or a health care decision shall

(i) Notwithstanding the exception in (e) of this section for do not resuscitate orders, a health care provider may perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation or other resuscitative measures on a patient even if there is a do not resuscitate order for the patient if the condition requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation or other resuscitative measures is precipitated by complications arising out of medical services being provided by the health care provider to the patient.

(j) The provisions of (i) of this section do not apply when a health care provider performs emergency medical services on a patient in the field, unless an online physician orders the health care provider to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation or other resuscitative measures; in this subsection,

(d) A health care provider other than a physician, an advanced practice registered nurse, or a physician assistant shall comply with the protocol adopted under (b) of this section for do not resuscitate orders when the health care provider is presented with a do not resuscitate identification, an oral do not resuscitate order issued directly by a physician, an advanced practice registered nurse, or a physician assistant if the applicable hospital allows oral do not resuscitate orders, or a written do not resuscitate order entered on and as required by a form prescribed by the department.

(e) Notwithstanding (d) of this section, if an individual has made an anatomical gift to occur at death and is in a hospital when a do not resuscitate order or an order to withdraw life-sustaining procedures is to be implemented for the individual, the order may not be implemented until the subject of the anatomical gift can be evaluated to determine if it is suitable for donation.

(f) A do not resuscitate order may not be made ineffective unless a physician, an advanced practice registered nurse, or a physician assistant revokes the do not resuscitate order, a patient for whom the order is written and who has capacity requests that the do not resuscitate order be revoked, or the patient for whom the order is written is under 18 years of age and the parent or guardian of the patient requests that the do not resuscitate order be revoked. Any physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant of a patient for whom a do not resuscitate order is written may revoke the do not resuscitate order if the person for whom the order is written requests that the physician, the advanced practice registered nurse, or the physician assistant revoke the do not resuscitate order.

(2) complying with a health care decision of a person based on a good faith belief that the person has authority to make a health care decision for a patient, including a decision to withhold or withdraw health care;

(3) declining to comply with a health care decision of a person based on a good faith belief that the person then lacked authority;

(4) complying with an advance health care directive and assuming in good faith that the directive was valid when made and has not been revoked or terminated;

(5) participating in the withholding or withdrawal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation under the direction or with the authorization of a physician, an advanced practice registered nurse, or a physician assistant or upon discovery of do not resuscitate identification upon an individual;

This subsection does not apply if the complications suffered by the patient are caused by gross negligence or reckless or intentional actions on the part of the health care provider, health care institution, or health care facility.

###### Sec. 13.52.090.   Statutory damages.

(a) A health care provider or institution that intentionally violates this chapter is liable to the aggrieved individual or the individual's estate for damages of $10,000 or actual damages resulting from the violation, whichever is greater, plus attorney fees as provided by court rule.

A "durable power of attorney for health care" means the designation of an agent to make health care decisions for you. Part 1 lets you name another individual as an agent to make health care decisions for you if you do not have the capacity to make your own decisions or if you want someone else to make those decisions for you now even though you still have the capacity to make those decisions.

Unless related to you, your agent may not be an owner, operator, or employee of a health care institution where you are receiving care.Unless the form you sign limits the authority of your agent, your agent may make all health care decisions for you that you could legally make for yourself.

If the value of the property or the debt exceeds $20,000, the transfer is not effective unless authorized by the court.

(b) A written acknowledgment of delivery, signed by a custodial trustee, is a sufficient receipt and discharge for property transferred to the custodial trustee under this section.

###### Sec. 13.60.050.   Multiple beneficiaries; separate custodial trusts; survivorship.

(a) Beneficial interests in a custodial trust created for multiple beneficiaries are considered to be separate custodial trusts of equal undivided interests for each beneficiary. Except in a transfer or declaration for use and benefit of a married couple, for whom survivorship is presumed, a right of survivorship does not exist unless the instrument creating the custodial trust specifically provides for survivorship.

(b) Custodial trust property held under this chapter by the same custodial trustee for the use and benefit of the same beneficiary may be administered as a single custodial trust.

(b) If the beneficiary is not incapacitated, a custodial trustee shall follow the directions of the beneficiary in the management, control, investment, or retention of the custodial trust property. In the absence of effective contrary direction by the beneficiary while not incapacitated, the custodial trustee shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with property of another and is not limited by another law, except  AS 13.90.010, restricting investments by fiduciaries. However, a custodial trustee, in the custodial trustee's discretion, may retain custodial trust property received from the transferor. If a custodial trustee has a special skill or expertise or is named custodial trustee on the basis of representation of a special skill or expertise, the custodial trustee shall use that skill or expertise.

(c) Subject to (b) of this section, a custodial trustee shall take control of and collect, hold, manage, invest, and reinvest custodial trust property.

(d) A custodial trustee at all times shall keep custodial trust property of which the custodial trustee has control, separate from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial trust property of the beneficiary. Custodial trust property, the title to which is subject to recordation, is identified as required by this subsection if an appropriate instrument identifying the property is recorded, and custodial trust property subject to registration is identified as required by this subsection if it is registered, or held in an account in the name of the custodial trustee, designated in substance "as custodial trustee for  _____________________________________  (name of beneficiary) under the Alaska Uniform Custodial Trust Act."

###### Sec. 13.60.080.   Use of custodial trust property.

(a) A custodial trustee shall pay to the beneficiary or expend for the beneficiary's use and benefit so much or all of the custodial trust property as the beneficiary while not incapacitated may direct from time to time.

(b) If the beneficiary is incapacitated, the custodial trustee shall expend so much or all of the custodial trust property as the custodial trustee considers advisable for the use and benefit of the beneficiary and individuals who were supported by the beneficiary when the beneficiary became incapacitated, or who are legally entitled to support by the beneficiary. Expenditures may be made in the manner, when, and to the extent that the custodial trustee determines suitable and proper, without court order and, except as otherwise provided in AS 13.12.212(d), without regard to other support, income, or property of the beneficiary.

(c) A custodial trustee may establish checking, savings, or other similar accounts of reasonable amounts under which either the custodial trustee or the beneficiary may withdraw funds from, or draw checks against, the accounts. Funds withdrawn from, or checks written against, the account by the beneficiary are distributions of custodial trust property by the custodial trustee to the beneficiary.

###### Sec. 13.60.090.   Determination of incapacity; effect.

(a) The custodial trustee shall administer the custodial trust as for an incapacitated beneficiary if

(b) A custodial trustee may determine that the beneficiary is incapacitated by relying upon

(1) previous direction or authority given by the beneficiary while not incapacitated, including direction or authority under a durable power of attorney;

(2) the certificate of the beneficiary's physician; or

(3) other persuasive evidence.

(c) If a custodial trustee for an incapacitated beneficiary reasonably concludes that the beneficiary's incapacity has ceased, or that circumstances concerning the beneficiary's ability to manage property and business affairs have changed since the creation of a custodial trust directing administration as for an incapacitated beneficiary, the custodial trustee may administer the trust as for a beneficiary who is not incapacitated.

(d) On petition of the beneficiary, the custodial trustee, or other person interested in the custodial trust property or the welfare of the beneficiary, the court shall determine whether the beneficiary is incapacitated.

(e) Absent determination of incapacity of the beneficiary under (b) or (d) of this section, a custodial trustee who has reason to believe that the beneficiary is incapacitated shall administer the custodial trust under the provisions of this chapter applicable to an incapacitated beneficiary.

(f) Incapacity of a beneficiary does not terminate

(1) the custodial trust;

(2) a designation of a successor custodial trustee;

(3) rights or powers of the custodial trustee; or

(4) the immunities of third persons acting on instructions of the custodial trustee.

###### Sec. 13.60.100.   Exemption of third person from liability.

In the absence of knowledge to the contrary, the third person is not responsible for determining

(1) the validity of the purported custodial trustee's designation;

(2) the propriety of, or the authority under this chapter for, an action of the purported custodial trustee;

(b) A custodial trustee is not personally liable to a third person

(1) on a contract properly entered into in a fiduciary capacity unless the custodial trustee fails to reveal that capacity or to identify the custodial trust in the contract; or

(2) for an obligation arising from control of custodial trust property or for a tort committed in the course of the administration of the custodial trust unless the custodial trustee is personally at fault.

(c) A beneficiary is not personally liable to a third person for an obligation arising from beneficial ownership of custodial trust property or for a tort committed in the course of administration of the custodial trust unless the beneficiary is personally in possession of the custodial trust property giving rise to the liability or is personally at fault.

(d) The provisions of (b) and (c) of this section do not preclude actions or proceedings to establish liability of the custodial trustee or beneficiary to the extent the person sued is protected as the insured by liability insurance.

###### Sec. 13.60.120.   Declination, resignation, incapacity, death, or removal of custodial trustee; designation of successor custodial trustee.

(a) Before accepting the custodial trust property, a person designated as custodial trustee may decline to serve by notifying the person who made the designation, the transferor, or the transferor's legal representative. If an event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred, the substitute custodial trustee designated under AS 13.60.020 becomes the custodial trustee, or, if a substitute custodial trustee has not been designated, the person who made the designation may designate a substitute custodial trustee under AS 13.60.020. In other cases, the transferor or the transferor's legal representative may designate a substitute custodial trustee.

(c) If a custodial trustee or successor custodial trustee is ineligible, resigns, dies, or becomes incapacitated, the successor designated under the trust instrument or under AS 13.60.020 becomes custodial trustee. If there is no effective provision for a successor, the beneficiary, if not incapacitated, may designate a successor custodial trustee. If the beneficiary is incapacitated, or fails to act within 90 days after the ineligibility, resignation, death, or incapacity of the custodial trustee, the beneficiary's conservator becomes successor custodial trustee. If the beneficiary does not have a conservator or the conservator fails to act, the resigning custodial trustee may designate a successor custodial trustee.

(d) If a successor custodial trustee is not designated under (c) of this section, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodial trustee, an adult member of the beneficiary's family, the guardian of the beneficiary, a person interested in the custodial trust property, or a person interested in the welfare of the beneficiary, may petition the court to designate a successor custodial trustee.

(e) A custodial trustee who declines to serve or resigns, or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodial trustee, as soon as practicable, shall put the custodial trust property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodial trustee.

If the online tool allows the user to modify or delete a direction at all times, a direction regarding disclosure using an online tool overrides a contrary direction by the user in a will, trust, power of attorney, or other record.

(b) If a user has not used an online tool to give direction under (a) of this section or if the custodian has not provided an online tool, the user may allow or prohibit in a will, trust, power of attorney, or other record, disclosure to a fiduciary of some or all of the user's digital assets, including the content of electronic communications sent or received by the user.

(c) A user's direction under (a) or (b) of this section overrides a contrary provision in a terms-of-service agreement that does not require the user to act affirmatively and distinctly from the user's assent to the terms of service.

(a) This chapter does not change or impair a right of a custodian or a user under a terms-of-service agreement to access and use digital assets of the user.

(d) If a user directs or a fiduciary requests a custodian to disclose under this chapter some, but not all, of the user's digital assets, the custodian is not required to disclose the assets if segregation of the assets would impose an undue burden on the custodian. If the custodian believes the direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or fiduciary may seek an order from the superior court to disclose

(1) a subset limited by date of the user's digital assets;

(D) if the disclaimed interest would pass to the disclaimant's estate had the disclaimant died before the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest instead passes by representation to the descendants of the disclaimant who survive the time of distribution; if no descendant of the disclaimant survives the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest passes to those persons, including the state but excluding the disclaimant, and in the shares as would succeed to the transferor's intestate estate under the intestate succession law of the transferor's domicile had the transferor died at the time of distribution; however, if the transferor's surviving spouse is living but is remarried at the time of distribution, the transferor is considered to have died unmarried at the time of distribution;

(4) on the disclaimer of a preceding interest, a future interest held by a person other than the disclaimant takes effect as if the disclaimant had died or ceased to exist immediately before the time of distribution, but a future interest held by the disclaimant is not accelerated in possession or enjoyment as a result of the disclaimer.

(b) A disclaimer under (a) of this section takes effect as of the death of the deceased tenant to whose death the disclaimer relates.
