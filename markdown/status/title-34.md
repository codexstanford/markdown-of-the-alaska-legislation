#### Article 1. Purposes and Rules of Construction.

###### Sec. 34.03.010.   Purpose and construction.

(a) This chapter shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.

(b) The underlying purposes and policies of this chapter are to

(1) simplify, clarify, modernize, and revise the law governing the rental of dwelling units and the rights and obligations of landlord and tenant;

(2) encourage landlord and tenant to maintain and improve the quality of housing; and

(3) make uniform the law among those states that enact it.

#### Article 2. Rental Agreements.

###### Sec. 34.03.020.   Terms and conditions of rental agreement.

(a) The landlord and tenant may include in a rental agreement clauses and conditions not prohibited by this chapter or by law, including rent, terms of agreement, and other provisions governing the rights and obligations of the parties.

(b) In the absence of agreement, the tenant shall pay as rent the fair rental value for the use and occupancy of the dwelling unit.

(c) Rent shall be payable without demand or notice at the time and place agreed upon by the parties.  Unless otherwise agreed, rent is payable at the dwelling unit. Unless otherwise agreed, rent is payable at the beginning of any term of one month or less and otherwise in equal monthly installments.  Unless otherwise agreed, rent shall be uniformly apportionable from day to day and shall be paid on the date the periodic tenancy begins and payable on or before the same date of each and every month thereafter until the tenancy terminates.

(d) Unless the rental agreement fixes a definite term, the tenancy shall be week to week in the case of a tenant who pays weekly rent, and in all other cases month to month.

(e) If required by the landlord, the landlord and the tenant shall include within the rental agreement, incorporate by reference in the rental agreement, or add as a separate attachment to the rental agreement a premises condition statement, setting out the condition of the premises, including fixtures but excluding reference to any of the other contents of the premises, and, if applicable, a contents inventory itemizing or describing all of the furnishings and other contents of the premises and specifying the condition of each of them. In the premises condition statement and contents inventory, the landlord and tenant shall describe the premises and its contents at the commencement of the term of the period of the occupancy covered by the rental agreement. When signed by the landlord and tenant, the premises condition statement and contents inventory completed under this subsection become part of the rental agreement.

###### Sec. 34.03.030.   Effect of unsigned or undelivered rental agreement.

(a) If the landlord does not sign and deliver a written rental agreement signed and delivered to the landlord by the tenant, acceptance of rent without reservation by the landlord gives the rental agreement the same effect as if it had been signed and delivered by the landlord.

(b) If the tenant does not sign and deliver a written rental agreement signed and delivered to the tenant by the landlord, acceptance of possession and payment of rent without reservation gives the rental agreement the same effect as if it had been signed and delivered by the tenant.

(c) If a rental agreement given effect by the operation of this section provides for a term longer than one year, it is effective only for one year.

###### Sec. 34.03.040.   Prohibited provisions in rental agreements.

(a) A rental agreement may not provide that the tenant or landlord

(1) agrees to waive or to forego rights or remedies under this chapter;

(2) authorizes a person to confess judgment on a claim arising out of the rental agreement;

(3) agrees to the exculpation or limitation of any liability of the landlord or tenant arising under the law or to indemnify the landlord or tenant for that liability or the costs connected with it;

(4) agrees to pay the landlord's attorney fees.

(b) A provision prohibited by (a) or (c) of this section included in a rental agreement is unenforceable.  If a landlord or tenant wilfully uses a rental agreement containing provisions known by the person to be prohibited, the other party may recover the amount of actual damages.

(c) A rental agreement between a mobile home park operator and a mobile home park tenant may not

(1) deny a tenant of a mobile home park the right to sell the tenant's mobile home within the park or require the resident or tenant to remove the mobile home from the park solely on the basis of the sale of the mobile home, nor may the mobile home park operator make a rule or regulation to the same effect, except that, within 30 days of written notice by the tenant of intent to sell the mobile home to a specified buyer, the operator or owner of the mobile home park may refuse to allow a sale for the following reasons:

(A) the mobile home is in violation of laws or ordinances relating to health, safety or welfare;

(B) the proposed buyer refuses to assume the same terms as are in the existing rental agreement; or

(C) the proposed buyer does not have sufficient financial responsibility;

(2) require a tenant to provide permanent improvements that become a part of the real property of the mobile home park owner or operator as a condition of tenancy in the mobile home park; however, the rental agreement may require the tenant to maintain existing conditions in the park;

(3) require payment of any type of vendor or transfer fee either by a tenant in the mobile home park desiring to sell the tenant's mobile home to another party or by any party desiring to purchase a mobile home from a tenant in the park as a condition of tenancy; however, this paragraph does not prevent the owner or operator from applying normal park standards to prospective tenants before granting or denying tenancy or from charging a reasonable vendor or transfer fee for services actually performed if the tenant is notified in writing of the amount of those charges before agreeing to move into the park; or

(4) require the prospective tenant to pay a fee to enter the mobile home park or a tenant to pay a fee to transfer the tenant's mobile home to another location outside the park; however, this paragraph does not prevent the owner or operator from charging a reasonable fee for services actually performed and if the tenant is notified in writing of the amount of those charges before agreeing to move into the park.

###### Sec. 34.03.050.   Separation of rents and obligations to maintain property forbidden.

A rental agreement, assignment, conveyance, trust deed, or security instrument may not permit the receipt of rent free of the obligation to comply with AS 34.03.100(a).

###### Sec. 34.03.060.   Sublease and assignment.

(a) Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the tenant may not sublet the premises or assign the rental agreement to another without the landlord's consent.

(b) The tenant's right to sublease the premises or assign the rental agreement to another shall be conditioned on obtaining the landlord's consent, which may be withheld only upon the grounds specified in (d) of this section; no further restrictions on sublease or assignment are enforceable.

(c) When the rental agreement requires the landlord's consent for sublease or assignment, the tenant may secure one or more persons who are willing to occupy the premises. Each prospective occupant shall make a written offer signed and delivered by the prospective occupant to the landlord, containing the following information on the prospective occupant:

(4) number of all other persons who would normally reside with the prospective occupant;

(5) two credit references, or responsible persons who will confirm the financial responsibility of the prospective occupant; and

(6) names and addresses of all landlords of the prospective occupant during the prior three years.

(d) Within 14 days after the written offer has been delivered to the landlord, the landlord may refuse consent to a sublease or assignment by a written rejection signed and delivered by the landlord to the tenant, containing one or more of the following reasonable grounds for rejecting the prospective occupant:

(1) insufficient credit standing or financial responsibility;

(2) number of persons in the household;

(3) number of persons under 18 years of age in the household;

(4) unwillingness of the prospective occupant to assume the same terms as are included in the existing rental agreement;

(5) proposed maintenance of pets;

(6) proposed commercial activity; or

(7) written information signed by a previous landlord, which shall accompany the rejection, setting out abuses of other premises occupied by the prospective occupant.

(e) In the event the written rejection fails to contain one or more grounds permitted by (d) of this section for rejecting the prospective occupant, the tenant may consider the landlord's consent given, or at the tenant's option may terminate the rental agreement by a written notice given without unnecessary delay to the landlord at least 30 days before the termination date specified in the notice.

(f) If the landlord does not deliver a written rejection signed by the landlord to the tenant within 14 days after a written offer has been delivered to the landlord by the tenant, the landlord's consent to the sublease or assignment shall be conclusively presumed.

(a) Except as provided in (h) of this section, a landlord may not demand or receive prepaid rent or a security deposit, however denominated, in an amount or value in excess of two months' periodic rent. This section does not apply to rental units where the rent exceeds $2,000 a month.

(b) Upon termination of the tenancy, property or money held by the landlord as prepaid rent or as a security deposit may be applied to the payment of accrued rent and the amount of damages that the landlord has suffered by reason of the tenant's noncompliance with AS 34.03.120. The accrued rent and damages must be itemized by the landlord in a written notice mailed to the tenant's last known address within the time limit prescribed by (g) of this section, together with the amount due the tenant.

Nothing in this chapter prohibits the landlord from commingling prepaid rents and security deposits in a single financial account; however, the landlord shall separately account for prepaid rent and security deposits received from each tenant. The landlord may not commingle prepaid rent and security deposits with other funds. The landlord may not use money held for one tenant in a trust account to

(1) refund the security deposit of another tenant;

(2) apply to the payment of another tenant's accrued rent;

(3) apply to damages suffered by the landlord because of another tenant's noncompliance with AS 34.03.120.

(d) If the landlord wilfully fails to comply with (b) of this section, the tenant may recover an amount not to exceed twice the actual amount withheld.

(e) This section does not preclude a landlord or tenant from recovering other damages to which either may be entitled under this chapter.

(f) The holder of the landlord's interest in the premises at the time of the termination of the tenancy is bound by this section.

(g) If the landlord or tenant gives notice that complies with AS 34.03.290, the landlord shall mail the written notice and refund required by (b) of this section within 14 days after the tenancy is terminated and possession is delivered by the tenant, except the landlord shall have 30 days after the tenancy is terminated to mail the refund if costs are deducted for damages that the landlord has suffered because of the tenant's noncompliance with AS 34.03.120. If the tenant does not give notice that complies with AS 34.03.290, the landlord shall mail the written notice and refund required by (b) of this section within 30 days after the tenancy is terminated, possession is delivered by the tenant, or the landlord becomes aware that the dwelling unit is abandoned. If the landlord does not know the mailing address of the tenant, but knows or has reason to know how to contact the tenant to give the notice required by (b) of this section, the landlord shall make a reasonable effort to deliver the notice and refund to the tenant.

(h) Notwithstanding the limitation on the amount of prepaid rent or security deposit in (a) of this section, a landlord may demand or receive an additional security deposit from a tenant who has a pet on the premises that is not a service animal. The additional security deposit

(1) may not exceed the periodic rent for one month; and

(2) shall be accounted for separately from prepaid rent or a security deposit received under (a) of this section and may be applied only to the amount of damages that are directly related to the pet of the tenant.

(i) In this section,

(1) "normal wear and tear" means deterioration that occurs from the intended use of the rental unit and without negligence, carelessness, accident, misuse, or abuse of the premises or contents by the tenant, members of the household of the tenant, or the invitees or guests of the tenant;

(a) In an action for possession based upon nonpayment of the rent or in an action for rent when the tenant is in possession, the tenant may counterclaim for any amount recoverable under the rental agreement or this chapter. If a counterclaim is made, the court shall determine whether the defense is supported by the evidence and, if so, may order that

(1) the periodic rent is to be reduced to reflect the diminution in value of the dwelling unit during the period of noncompliance;

(2) the action be continued for a reasonable time to enable the landlord to cure the violation;

(3) the tenant pay into court all or part of the rent accrued and thereafter accruing; if the violations have not been cured within six months, the court shall enter judgment for the defendant and either refund to the defendant all money deposited or use the money for the purpose of making the dwelling fit for human habitation; if the violations have been cured, the court shall determine the amount due to each party; the party to whom a net amount is owed shall be paid first from the money paid into the court, and the balance by the other party; if no rent remains due after application of this section, judgment shall be entered for the tenant in the action for possession;

(4) the tenant vacate the dwelling during the making of necessary repairs, when the repairs cannot be made without vacation of the premises, the tenant to be reinstated upon completion of the repairs.

(1) if the tenant or someone in the tenant's control deliberately inflicts substantial damage to the premises in breach of AS 34.03.120(a)(5) or the tenant engages in or permits another to engage in prostitution or another illegal activity at the premises in breach of AS 34.03.120(b), the landlord may deliver a written notice to quit to the tenant under AS 09.45.100§09.45.105 specifying the act or activity constituting the breach and specifying that the rental agreement will terminate on a date that is not less than 24 hours or more than five days after service of the notice; for purposes of this paragraph, damage to premises is "substantial" if the loss, destruction, or defacement of property attributable to the deliberate infliction of damage to the premises exceeds $400;

(2) if there is a material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement, or if there is noncompliance with AS 34.03.120, other than deliberate infliction of substantial damage to the premises or other than noncompliance as to a utility service for which the provisions of (e) of this section apply, materially affecting health and safety, the landlord may deliver a written notice to quit to the tenant under AS 09.45.100§09.45.110 specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and specifying that the rental agreement will terminate on a date not less than 10 days after service of the notice; if the breach is not remedied, the rental agreement terminates as provided in the notice subject to the provisions of this section; if the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages or otherwise and the tenant adequately remedies the breach before the date specified in the notice, the rental agreement will not terminate; in the absence of due care by the tenant, if substantially the same act or omission that constituted a prior noncompliance of which notice was given recurs within six months, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement upon at least five days' written notice to quit specifying the breach and the date of termination of the rental agreement.

(b) If rent is unpaid when due and the tenant fails to pay rent in full within seven days after written notice by the landlord of nonpayment and the intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within that period of time, the tenancy terminates unless the landlord agrees to allow the tenant to remain in occupancy, and the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and immediately recover possession of the rental unit. Only one written notice of default need be given the tenant by the landlord as to any one default. A landlord who has given written notice to the tenant under this subsection may accept a partial payment of the rent due under the rental agreement and extend the date for the eviction accordingly.

(c) Except as provided in this chapter, the landlord may recover actual damages and obtain injunctive relief for any noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or AS 34.03.120.

(d) An order of abatement entered by a court under AS 09.50.170 terminates a rental agreement on the premises subject to the order of abatement.

(e) If a public utility providing electricity, natural gas, or water to the premises occupied by the tenant discontinues the service to the premises due to the failure of the tenant to pay for the utility service, the landlord may deliver a written notice to quit to the tenant advising that, notwithstanding (a) of this section, the tenancy will terminate five days after the landlord's service of the notice. If, within three days from the service of the notice, the tenant reinstates the discontinued service and repays the landlord for any amounts paid by the landlord to reinstate service, and if damage did not occur to the rental unit as a result of the discontinuance of service, the rental agreement will not terminate. However, in the absence of due care by the tenant, if substantially the same act or omission that constituted a prior noncompliance under this subsection for which notice was given recurs within six months, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement upon at least three days' written notice specifying the breach and the date of termination of the rental agreement.

(f) A person whose use of premises is based solely on rights acquired by a tenant, and who has not individually acquired the rights of a tenant under this chapter, does not acquire rights under this chapter as a result of being present on the premises.

###### Sec. 34.03.225.   Limitations on mobile home park operator's right to terminate.

(a) A mobile home park operator may evict a mobile home or a mobile home park dweller or tenant only for one of the following reasons:

(1) the mobile home dweller or tenant has defaulted in the payment of rent owed;

(2) the mobile home dweller or tenant has been convicted of violating a federal or state law or local ordinance, and that violation is continuing and is detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of other dwellers or tenants in the mobile home park;

(3) the mobile home dweller or tenant has violated a provision, enforceable under AS 34.03.130, of the rental agreement or lease signed by both parties and not prohibited by law including rent and the terms of agreement; and

(4) a change in the use of the land comprising the mobile home park, or the portion of it on which the mobile home to be evicted is located; however, all dwellers or tenants so affected by a change in land use shall be given at least 270 days' notice, or longer if a longer notice period is provided in a valid lease or required by a municipality; a dweller or tenant so affected by a change in land use shall be given a quit date not earlier than May 1 and not later than October 15; a municipality may establish a mobile home relocation fund and require that a dweller or tenant so affected by a change in land use be given a longer notice period or compensated from the fund for the cost of disconnecting, relocating, and reestablishing the dweller's or tenant's mobile home.

(b) A mobile home park operator may not evict a mobile home or a mobile home park dweller or tenant because of the age of the mobile home, except that a mobile home or a mobile home park dweller or tenant may be evicted if, when the mobile home was admitted to the mobile home park, a regulation of the mobile home park limiting the age of a mobile home in the mobile home park was in effect, the mobile home is sold after the age limitation has been exceeded, and the owner or tenant of the mobile home has failed to bring the unit into compliance with the life safety requirements of 24 C.F.R. Part 3280.  This does not prohibit eviction for violation of a provision enforceable under AS 34.03.130 that requires that a mobile home be in a fit and habitable condition.

(c) When, under (a) of this section, a mobile home park owner is required to give notice to evict a mobile home owner or a mobile home park dweller or tenant, provision of notice to quit under AS 09.45.100§09.45.105 satisfies the requirement of notice.

###### Sec. 34.03.230.   Remedies for absence, nonuse and abandonment.

(a) When the rental agreement requires the tenant to give notice to the landlord of an anticipated extended absence in excess of seven days as required in AS 34.03.150 and the tenant wilfully fails to do so, the landlord may recover an amount not to exceed one and one-half times the actual damages.

(b) During an absence of the tenant in excess of seven days, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit at times reasonably necessary as provided in AS 34.03.140. The landlord may reenter the dwelling unit and, if there is evidence that the tenant has abandoned the dwelling unit, unless the landlord and tenant have made a specific agreement to the contrary, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement.

(c) If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the landlord shall make reasonable efforts to rent it at a fair rental value.  If the landlord rents the dwelling unit for a term beginning before the expiration of the rental agreement, the agreement is considered terminated on the date the new tenancy begins. The rental agreement is considered terminated by the landlord on the date the landlord has notice of the abandonment if the landlord fails to use reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental value or if the landlord accepts the abandonment as a surrender.  If the tenancy is from month to month, or week to week, the term of the rental agreement for purposes of this section shall be considered a month or a week, as the case may be.

###### Sec. 34.03.240.   Waiver of landlord's right to terminate.

Acceptance of rent with knowledge of a default by the tenant or acceptance of performance by the tenant that varies from the terms of the rental agreement or rules or regulations subsequently adopted by the landlord constitutes a waiver of the right of the landlord to terminate the rental agreement for that breach, unless otherwise agreed after the breach has occurred.

###### Sec. 34.03.250.   Landlord liens; distraint for rent abolished.

(a) A lien or security interest on behalf of the landlord in the tenant's household goods is not enforceable unless perfected before March 19, 1974.

(b) Distraint for rent is abolished.

###### Sec. 34.03.260.   Disposition of abandoned property.

(a) Except as otherwise agreed, if, upon termination of a tenancy including but not limited to a termination after expiration of a lease or by surrender or abandonment of the premises, a tenant has left personal property upon the premises, and the landlord reasonably believes that the tenant has abandoned this personal property, the landlord may

(1) give notice to the tenant demanding that the property be removed within the dates set out in the notice but not less than 15 days after delivery or mailing of the notice, and that if the property is not removed within the time specified, the property may be sold; if the property is not removed within the time specified in the notice, the landlord may sell the property at a public sale; the landlord may dispose of perishable commodities in any manner the landlord considers fit;

(2) if the tenant has left personal property that is reasonably determined by the landlord to be valueless or of such little value that the cost of storing and conducting a public sale would probably exceed the amount that would be realized from the sale, the landlord may notify the tenant that the property be removed within the date specified in the notice but not less than 15 days after delivery or mailing of the notice, and that if the property is not removed within the time specified, the landlord intends to destroy or otherwise dispose of the property; if the property is not removed within the time specified in the notice, the landlord may destroy or otherwise dispose of the property; in the notice, the landlord shall indicate an election to sell certain items of the tenant's personal property at public sale and to destroy or otherwise dispose of the remainder.

(b) After notice as provided in (a) of this section, the landlord shall store all personal property of the tenant in a place of safekeeping and shall exercise reasonable care of the property, but is not responsible to the tenant for loss not caused by the landlord's deliberate or negligent act.  The landlord may elect to store the property on the premises previously demised, in which event the storage cost may not exceed the fair rental value of the premises.  If the tenant's property is removed to a commercial storage company, the storage cost shall include the actual charge for the storage and removal from the premises to the place of storage.

(c) After landlord's notice under (a) of this section, or otherwise, if the tenant makes timely response in writing of an intention to remove the personal property from the premises and does not do so within the time specified in the landlord's notice or within 15 days of the delivery or mailing of the tenant's written response whichever is later, it shall be conclusively presumed that the tenant has abandoned the property.  If the tenant removes the property after notice, the landlord is entitled to the cost of storage for the period the property has remained in the landlord's safekeeping.

(d) The landlord is not liable in damages in an action by a tenant claiming loss by reason of the landlord's storage, destruction, or disposition of property under this section. A landlord who deliberately or negligently violates the provisions of this section is liable for actual damages and penal damages of an amount not to exceed actual damages.

(e) A public sale authorized under this section shall be conducted under AS 09.35.140.  The landlord may dispose of any property upon which no bid is made at the public sale.

###### Sec. 34.03.270.   Remedy after termination.

If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord may have a claim for possession and for rent and a separate claim for actual damages for breach of the rental agreement.

###### Sec. 34.03.280.   Recovery of possession limited.

A landlord may not recover or take possession of the dwelling unit by action or otherwise, including wilful diminution of services to the tenant by interrupting or causing the interruption of electricity, gas, water, sanitary, or other essential services to the tenant, except in case of abandonment, surrender, circumstances beyond the control of the landlord due to energy conditions, or as permitted in this chapter.

###### Sec. 34.03.285.   Service of process upon tenant.

In an action for possession under this chapter, the summons and complaint shall be served under the provisions of Rule No. 85 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.  A continuance may not be granted plaintiff or defendant except for good cause shown.

#### Article 7. Periodic Tenancy, Holdover, and Abuse of Access.

###### Sec. 34.03.290.   Periodic tenancy and holdover.

(a) While rent is current, the landlord or the tenant may terminate a week to week tenancy by a written notice given to the other at least 14 days before the termination date specified in the notice.

(b) The landlord or the tenant may terminate a month to month tenancy by a written notice given to the other at least 30 days before the rental due date specified in the notice.

(c) If the tenant remains in possession without the landlord's consent after expiration of the term of the rental agreement or after its termination under (a) or (b) of this section, the landlord may, after serving a notice to quit to the tenant under AS 09.45.100§09.45.105, bring an action for possession and if the tenant's holdover is wilful and not in good faith the landlord, in addition, may recover an amount not to exceed one and one-half times the actual damages. If the landlord consents to the tenant's continued occupancy, AS 34.03.020 applies.

###### Sec. 34.03.300.   Landlord and tenant remedies for abuse of access.

(a) If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel access or terminate the rental agreement.  In either case, the landlord may recover an amount not to exceed the actual damages or one month's periodic rent, whichever is greater. If the landlord terminates the rental agreement, the landlord shall give written notice to the tenant at least 10 days before the date specified in the notice.

(b) If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an unreasonable manner or makes repeated demands for entry otherwise lawful but which have the effect of unreasonably harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief to prevent the recurrence of the conduct or terminate the rental agreement.  In either case, the tenant may recover an amount not to exceed the actual damages or one month's periodic rent, whichever is greater, court costs and reasonable attorney fees. If the tenant terminates the rental agreement, the tenant shall give written notice to the landlord at least 10 days before the date specified in the notice.

(3) organized or become a member of a tenant's union or similar organization; or

(4) complained to a governmental agency responsible for enforcement of governmental housing, wage, price, or rent controls.

(b) If the landlord acts in violation of (a) of this section, the tenant is entitled to the remedies provided in AS 34.03.210 and has a defense in an action against the tenant for possession.

(c) Notwithstanding (a) and (b) of this section, after serving a notice to quit to the tenant under AS 09.45.100§09.45.105, a landlord may bring an action for possession if

(2) has completed a capital improvement of the dwelling unit or the property of which it is a part and the increase in rent does not exceed the amount that may be claimed for federal income tax purposes as a straight-line depreciation of the improvement, prorated among the dwelling units benefited by the improvement;

(3) can establish by competent evidence that the rent now demanded of the tenant does not exceed the rent charged other tenants of similar dwelling units in the building or, in the case of a single-family residence or if there is no similar dwelling unit in the building, does not exceed the fair rental value of the dwelling unit.

(e) Maintenance of the action under (c) of this section does not release the landlord from liability under AS 34.03.160(b).

(b) For the purposes of (a) of this section, the application of AS 34.08.470 to a common interest community created under AS 34.07 before January 1, 1986, with respect to an event or circumstance occurring after January 1, 1986, does not invalidate a provision in the declaration of the common interest community, even if the provision in the declaration conflicts with AS 34.08.470.

###### Sec. 34.08.050.   Applicability to small preexisting cooperatives and planned communities.

If a cooperative or planned community created within the state before January 1, 1986 contains no more than 12 units and is not subject to any development rights, it is subject only to AS 34.08.720 §34.08.740, unless the declaration is amended in conformity with law and with the procedures and requirements of the declaration to take advantage of the provisions of AS 34.08.060, in which case all the sections enumerated in AS 34.08.040 apply to the cooperative or planned community.

(a) With the exception of AS 34.08.720 §34.08.740, this chapter does not apply to a common interest community in which each unit is restricted exclusively to nonresidential use unless the declaration provides that the chapter does apply to the common interest community.

(b) This chapter applies to a common interest community containing some units that are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use and other units that are not restricted exclusively to nonresidential use only if the declaration provides that the chapter applies to the common interest community or the real estate comprising the units that may be used for residential purposes would be a common interest community in the absence of the units that may not be used for residential purposes.

###### Sec. 34.08.080.   Applicability to out-of-state common interest communities.

This chapter does not apply to a common interest community or unit located outside the state, but AS 34.08.520 §34.08.580 apply to a contract for the disposition of a common interest community or unit that is signed in the state by a party unless the disposition is exempt under AS 34.08.510(b).

(a) A common interest community may be created under this chapter only by recording a declaration executed in the same manner as a deed and, in a cooperative, by conveying the real estate subject to the declaration to the association.  The declaration must be recorded, and a plat or plan that is part of the declaration filed and recorded, in each recording district in which a portion of the common interest community is located and must be indexed in the grantee's index in the name of the common interest community and the association and in the grantor's index in the name of each person executing the declaration.

(b) In a condominium, a declaration or an amendment to a declaration that adds a unit may not be recorded, and a plat or plan that is part of the declaration may not be filed or recorded, unless the structural components and mechanical systems of each building containing or comprising a unit of the condominium are completed substantially in accordance with the plans, as evidenced by a certificate of completion recorded with the declaration or amendment to the declaration and executed by

(2) if a chute, flue, duct, wire, conduit, bearing wall, bearing column, or other fixture lies partially within and partially outside the designated boundaries of a unit, the portion serving only the unit is a limited common element allocated solely to the unit, and any portion serving more than one unit or a portion of the common elements is a part of the common elements;

(3) subject to (2) of this section, spaces, interior partitions, and other fixtures and improvements within the boundaries of a unit are a part of the unit;

(4) shutters, awnings, window boxes, doorsteps, stoops, porches, decks, balconies, patios, and each exterior door and window or other fixture designed to serve a single unit that is located outside the boundaries of the unit, are limited common elements allocated exclusively to the unit.

###### Sec. 34.08.110.   Construction and validity of declaration and bylaws.

(a) Each provision of the declaration and bylaws is severable.

(b) The rule against perpetuities does not defeat any provision of the declaration, bylaws, rules, or regulations adopted under AS 34.08.320(a)(1).

(c) In a conflict between the provisions of the declaration and the bylaws, the declaration prevails unless the declaration is inconsistent with this chapter.

(d) Title to a unit and common elements is not rendered unmarketable or otherwise affected by reason of an insubstantial failure of the declaration to comply with this chapter.  Whether a substantial failure impairs marketability is not affected by this chapter.

###### Sec. 34.08.120.   Description of units.

A description of a unit that sets out the name of the common interest community, the recording data for the declaration, the recording district in which the common interest community is located, and the identifying number of the unit, is a legally sufficient description of the unit and all rights, obligations, and interests appurtenant to the unit that were created by the declaration or bylaws.

###### Sec. 34.08.130.   Contents of declaration.

(a) The declaration must contain

(1) the names of the common interest community and the association and a statement that the common interest community is either a condominium, cooperative, or planned community;

(A) either a statement fixing the boundaries of the portions and regulating the order in which the portions may be subjected to the exercise of each development right or a statement that assurances are not made with regard to matters under this paragraph; and

(B) a statement as to whether, if a development right is exercised in a portion of the real estate subject to the development right, the development right must be exercised in all or in any other portion of the remainder of that real estate;

(10) any other condition or limitation under which the rights described in (8) of this subsection may be exercised or will lapse;

(11) an allocation to each unit of the allocated interests in the manner described in AS 34.08.150;

(12) any restrictions

(A) on use, occupancy, and alienation of the units, and

(b) A declaration may contain other matters the declarant considers appropriate.

###### Sec. 34.08.140.   Leasehold common interest communities.

(a) If the expiration or termination of a lease or a memorandum of the lease will terminate the common interest community or reduce its size, the lease or a memorandum of the lease must be recorded.  In a condominium or planned community, the lessor of each lease described in this subsection shall sign the declaration.  The declaration must state

(1) the recording data for the lease or a summary of the complete lease;

(2) the date on which the lease is scheduled to expire;

(3) a legally sufficient description of the real estate subject to the lease;

(4) any right of the unit owners to redeem the reversion and the manner in which the rights may be exercised, or a statement that the unit owners do not have a right to redeem the reversion;

(5) any right of the unit owners to remove any improvements within a reasonable time after the expiration or termination of the lease, or a statement that the unit owners do not have the right to remove improvements after the expiration or termination of the lease; and

(6) any right of the unit owners to renew the lease and the conditions of the renewal, or a statement that the unit owners do not have the right to renew the lease.

(b) After the declaration for a leasehold condominium or leasehold planned community is recorded, and a plat or plan that is part of the declaration is filed and recorded, neither the lessor nor the successor in interest of the lessor may terminate the leasehold interest of a unit owner who makes timely payment of a unit owner's share of the rent and otherwise complies with the covenants that, if violated, would entitle the lessor to terminate the lease.  The leasehold interest of a unit owner in a condominium or planned community is not affected by the failure of any other person to pay rent or fulfill a covenant.

(c) The acquisition of the leasehold interest of a unit owner by the owner of the reversion or remainder does not merge the leasehold and fee simple interests unless the leasehold interests of all unit owners subject to that reversion or remainder are acquired.

(d) If the expiration or termination of a lease decreases the number of units in a common interest community, the allocated interests must be reallocated under AS 34.08.740(a) as if the units had been taken by eminent domain.  The reallocation must be confirmed by an amendment to the declaration prepared, executed, and recorded by the association of unit owners; a plat or plan that accompanies the amendment must be filed and recorded with the amendment.

###### Sec. 34.08.150.   Allocation of allocated interests.

(a) The declaration must allocate

(1) to each unit in a condominium, a fraction or percentage of undivided interests in the common elements and in the common expenses of the association and a portion of the votes in the association;

(2) to each unit in a cooperative, an ownership interest in the association, a fraction or percentage of the common expenses of the association and a portion of the votes in the association; and

(3) to each unit in a planned community, a fraction or percentage of the common expenses of the association and a portion of the votes in the association.

(b) The declaration must state the formulas used to establish allocations of interests.  The allocations may not discriminate in favor of units owned by the declarant or an affiliate of the declarant.

(c) If a unit may be added to or withdrawn from the common interest community, the declaration must state the formulas to be used to reallocate the allocated interests among the units included in the common interest community after the addition or withdrawal.

(d) The declaration may provide (1) that different allocations of votes shall be made to the units on particular matters specified in the declaration; (2) for cumulative voting only for the purpose of electing members of the executive board; and (3) for class voting on specified issues affecting the class if necessary to protect valid interests of the class.  A declarant may not utilize cumulative or class voting for the purpose of evading any limitation imposed on declarants by this chapter nor may units constitute a class because they are owned by a declarant.

(e) Except for minor variations due to rounding, the sum of the common expense liabilities and, in a condominium, the sum of the undivided interests in the common elements allocated at any time to all the units must each equal one if stated as a fraction or 100 percent if stated as a percentage.  In the event of discrepancy between an allocated interest and the result derived from application of the pertinent formula, the allocated interest prevails.

(f) In a condominium, the common elements are not subject to partition, and any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an undivided interest in the common elements made without the unit to which that interest is allocated is void.

(g) In a cooperative, any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an ownership interest in the association made without the possessory interest in the unit to which that interest is related is void.

###### Sec. 34.08.160.   Limited common elements.

(a) Except for the limited common elements described in AS 34.08.100(2) and (4), the declaration must specify to which unit or units each limited common element is allocated.  An allocation may not be altered without the consent of the unit owners whose units are affected.

(b) Except as the declaration otherwise provides, a limited common element may be reallocated by an amendment to the declaration executed by the unit owners between or among whose units the reallocation is made.  The persons executing the amendment shall provide a copy of the amendment to the association, which shall record the amendment and file and record a plat or plan that accompanies the amendment. The amendment must be recorded, and an accompanying plat or plan filed and recorded, in the names of the parties and the common interest community.

(c) A common element not previously allocated as a limited common element may be allocated as a limited common element only under provisions in the declaration adopted under AS 34.08.130(a)(7).  The allocation must be made by an amendment to the declaration.

###### Sec. 34.08.170.   Plats and plans.

(a) Plats and plans are a part of the declaration and are required for all common interest communities except cooperatives. Separate plats and plans are not required by this chapter if the information required by this section is contained in either a plat or plan.  Each plat and plan must be clear and legible and contain a certification that the plat or plan contains the information required by this section.

(b) Each plat must show

(1) the name and a survey or general schematic map of the entire common interest community;

(2) the location and dimensions of the real estate not subject to development rights or subject only to the development right to withdraw, and the location and dimensions of each existing improvement within the real estate;

(3) a legally sufficient description of the real estate subject to development rights, labeled to identify the rights applicable to each parcel;

(4) the extent of each encroachment by or upon a portion of the common interest community;

(5) to the extent feasible, a legally sufficient description of each easement serving or burdening a portion of the common interest community;

(6) the location and dimensions of any vertical unit boundaries not shown or projected on plans filed and recorded under (d) of this section and the identifying number of the unit;

(7) the location with reference to an established datum of any horizontal unit boundaries not shown or projected on plans filed and recorded under (d) of this section and the identifying number of the unit;

(8) a legally sufficient description of any real estate in which the unit owners will own only an estate for years, labeled as "leasehold real estate";

(9) the distance between noncontiguous parcels of real estate comprising the common interest community;

(10) the location and dimensions of limited common elements, including porches, decks, balconies, and patios, other than parking spaces and the other limited common elements described in AS 34.08.100(2) and (4);

(11) in the case of real estate not subject to development rights, all other matters customarily shown on land surveys.

(c) A plat may also show the intended location and dimensions of a contemplated improvement to be constructed within the common interest community.  A contemplated improvement shown must be labeled either "MUST BE BUILT" or "NEED NOT BE BUILT."

(d) To the extent not shown or projected on the plats, plans of the units must show or project

(1) the location and dimensions of the vertical boundaries of each unit, and the identifying number of the unit;

(2) any horizontal unit boundaries, with reference to an established datum, and the identifying number of the unit; and

(3) each unit in which the declarant has reserved the right to create additional units or common elements, identified appropriately.

(e) Unless the declaration provides otherwise, the horizontal boundaries of part of a unit located outside a building have the same elevation as the horizontal boundaries of the inside part and need not be depicted on the plats and plans.

(f) Upon the exercise of a development right, the declarant shall either file and record new plats and plans necessary to conform to the requirements of (a), (b), and (d) of this section, or file and record new certifications of plats and plans previously filed and recorded if the plats and plans otherwise conform to the requirements of (a), (b), and (d) of this section.

(g) A certification of a plat or plan required by this section or AS 34.08.090(b) shall be made by an independent registered surveyor, architect, or engineer.

(h) The state recorder shall prescribe the style, size, form, and quality of plats and plans filed and recorded under this chapter.

###### Sec. 34.08.180.   Exercise of development rights.

(a) To exercise a development right reserved under AS 34.08.130(a)(8), a declarant shall prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration, file and record a plat or plan that accompanies the amendment, and, in a condominium or planned community, comply with AS 34.08.170. The declarant is the unit owner of the units created under the amendment. The amendment to the declaration must assign an identifying number to each new unit created, and, except in the case of subdivision or conversion of units described in (b) of this section, reallocate the allocated interests among all units. The amendment must describe common elements and any limited common elements created under the amendment and, in the case of limited common elements, designate the unit to which each is allocated to the extent required by AS 34.08.160.

(b) A development right may be reserved within any real estate added to the common interest community if the amendment adding the real estate includes the matters required by AS 34.08.130 or 34.08.140, and, in a condominium or planned community, if the plats and plans include the matters required by AS 34.08.170.  This provision does not extend the time limit on the exercise of development rights imposed by the declaration under AS 34.08.130(a)(8).

(c) Whenever a declarant exercises a development right to subdivide or convert a unit previously created into additional units, common elements, or both,

(1) if the declarant converts the unit entirely to common elements, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of the unit among the other units as if that unit had been taken by eminent domain; and

(2) if the declarant subdivides the unit into two or more units, whether or not any part of the unit is converted into common elements, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of the unit among the units created by the subdivision in any reasonable manner prescribed by the declarant.

(d) If the declaration under AS 34.08.130(a)(8) provides that all or a portion of the real estate is subject to a right of withdrawal:

(1) if all of the real estate is subject to withdrawal and the declaration does not describe separate portions of real estate subject to the right, none of the real estate may be withdrawn after a unit has been conveyed to a purchaser; and

(2) if a portion is subject to withdrawal, it may not be withdrawn after a unit in the portion has been conveyed to a purchaser.

(e) A declarant may terminate development rights by an amendment to the declaration.

###### Sec. 34.08.190.   Alterations of units.

Subject to the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law, a unit owner (1) may make an improvement or alteration to the unit that does not impair the structural integrity or mechanical systems or lessen the support of a portion of the common interest community; (2) may not change the appearance of the common elements or the exterior appearance of a unit or any portion of the common interest community without permission of the association; (3) after acquiring an adjoining unit or an adjoining part of an adjoining unit, may remove or alter an intervening partition or create apertures in the partition even if the partition in whole or in part is a common element, if the removal or alteration does not impair the structural integrity or mechanical systems or lessen the support of a portion of the common interest community and is completed according to applicable codes and in a skillful and workmanlike manner. Removal of partitions or creation of apertures under this paragraph is not an alteration of boundaries.

###### Sec. 34.08.200.   Relocation of boundaries between adjoining units.

(a) Subject to the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law, the boundaries between adjoining units may be relocated by an amendment to the declaration upon application to the association by the owners of the units.  If the owners of the adjoining units have specified a reallocation between their units of their allocated interests, the application must state the proposed reallocations.  Unless the executive board determines within 30 days that the reallocations are unreasonable, the association shall prepare an amendment that identifies the units involved and states the reallocations.  The amendment must be executed by those unit owners, contain words of conveyance between them, and, on recording, be indexed in the name of the grantor, the grantee, and the association.

(b) The association

(1) in a condominium or planned community shall prepare, file, and record plats or plans necessary to show the altered boundaries between adjoining units, and their dimensions and identifying numbers; and

(2) in a cooperative shall prepare and record amendments to the declaration, and file and record a plat or plan necessary to show or describe the altered boundaries between adjoining units and their dimensions and identifying numbers.

###### Sec. 34.08.210.   Subdivision of units.

(a) If the declaration expressly permits it, a unit may be subdivided into two or more units.  Upon application of a unit owner to subdivide a unit, the association shall, subject to the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law, prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration subdividing the unit, including in a condominium or planned community filing and recording a plat or plan that accompanies the amendment.

(b) The amendment to the declaration must be executed by the owner of the unit to be subdivided, assign an identifying number to each unit created, and reallocate the allocated interests formerly allocated to the subdivided unit to the new units in any reasonable manner prescribed by the owner of the subdivided unit.

###### Sec. 34.08.220.   Easement for encroachments.

If a unit or common element encroaches on another unit or common element, a valid easement for the encroachment exists. The easement does not relieve a unit owner of liability in case of wilful misconduct nor relieve a declarant or any other person of liability for failure to adhere to any plats and plans or, in a cooperative, to any representation in the public offering statement.

###### Sec. 34.08.230.   Use for sales purposes.

(a) A declarant may maintain sales offices, management offices, and models in units or on common elements in the common interest community only if the declaration permits it and specifies the rights of a declarant with regard to their number, size, location, and relocation.  In a cooperative or condominium, a sales office, management office, or model not designated a unit by the declaration is a common element.  A declarant who ceases to be a unit owner ceases to have any rights under this section unless the unit is removed promptly from the common interest community under a right to remove reserved in the declaration.  A declarant may maintain signs on the common elements advertising the common interest community subject to any limitations in the declaration.

(b) Rights granted under this section are subject to state law and to municipal ordinance.

###### Sec. 34.08.240.   Easement rights.

(a) Subject to the provisions of the declaration, a declarant has an easement through the common elements as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of discharging the declarant's obligations or exercising special declarant rights, whether arising under this chapter or reserved in the declaration.

(b) In a planned community, subject to the provisions of AS 34.08.320(a)(6) and 34.08.430, a unit owner has an easement

(1) in the common elements for purposes of access to their units; and

(2) to use the common elements and all real estate that must become common elements for all other purposes.

###### Sec. 34.08.250.   Amendment of declaration.

(a) Except for amendments that may be executed by a declarant under AS 34.08.170(b) or 34.08.180, by the association under AS 34.08.140(d), 34.08.160(c), 34.08.200(a), 34.08.210, or 34.08.740, or by certain unit owners under AS 34.08.160(b), 34.08.200(a), 34.08.210(b), or 34.08.260(b), and except as limited by (d) or required by (f) of this section, a declaration, including any required plats and plans, may be amended only by vote or agreement of unit owners of units comprising either at least 67 percent of the allocated interests in the association or a larger percentage specified in the declaration. A declaration may not specify a smaller number unless all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use.

(b) An action to challenge the validity of an amendment adopted by the association under this section may not be brought more than one year after the amendment is recorded.

(c) Each amendment to the declaration must be recorded, and a plat or plan that accompanies the amendment filed and recorded, in each recording district in which a portion of the common interest community is located and the amendment is effective only upon recording.  An amendment, except an amendment under AS 34.08.200(a), must be indexed in the name of the common interest community and the association and in the name of the parties executing the amendment.

(d) Except to the extent expressly permitted or required in this chapter, an amendment may not create or increase special declarant rights, increase the number of units, or change the boundaries of a unit, the allocated interests of a unit, or the uses to which a unit is restricted, in the absence of unanimous consent of the unit owners.

(e) An amendment to the declaration required by this chapter to be recorded by the association must be prepared, executed, recorded, and certified on behalf of the association by an officer of the association designated for that purpose or, in the absence of designation, by the president of the association.

(f) The time limits specified in a declaration described under AS 34.08.130(a)(8) may be extended and additional development rights created if persons entitled to cast at least 80 percent of the votes in the association, including 80 percent of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant, agree to the extension or additional development rights. The agreement is effective 30 days after an amendment to the declaration reflecting the terms of the agreement is recorded unless all persons holding special declarant rights affected by the amendment or security interests in those rights

(1) record a written objection within the 30-day period, in which case, the amendment is void; or

(2) consent in writing when the amendment is recorded, in which case, the amendment is effective when recorded.

(g) If a declaration requires an association to obtain the consent of a lienholder with a lien on the property before the association may amend the declaration, the association may obtain the consent of the lienholder under (h)§(n) of this section.

(h) To amend the declaration under (g) of this section, the association shall send to a lienholder a dated written notice and a copy of the proposed amendment by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the most recent address of the lienholder shown on the mortgage, deed of trust, or other document that established the lien and to any other address provided by the lienholder to the association in writing.

(i) The association shall include in the notice provided under (h) of this section

(1) a statement that the association intends to amend the declaration;

(2) a request that the lienholder consent to the amendment;

(3) a statement that the association will amend the declaration if the lienholder fails to respond to the notice within 60 days after the postmark date of the notice; and

(4) a statement that the lienholder may not unreasonably withhold the lienholder's consent.

(j) If an association complies with (h) and (i) of this section and the lienholder fails to respond to the association within 60 days after the postmark date of the notice provided under (h) of this section, the lienholder is considered to have approved the proposed amendment.

(k) A lienholder may not unreasonably withhold the lienholder's consent to an amendment under (g)§(n) of this section.

(l) The provisions of (g)§(n) of this section are not intended to be the exclusive method for an association to obtain the consent of a lienholder to an amendment of the declaration. If an association obtains the consent of a lienholder without using the method provided by (g)§(n) of this section, the association may obtain the consent of other lienholders by using the method provided by (g)§(n) of this section.

(m) The provisions of (g)§(n) of this section apply to a lienholder whose lien on the property has been recorded under AS 40.17.

(n) In (g)§(m) of this section, "lienholder" means a person that is a mortgagee, lender, or other holder of a lien on the property.

###### Sec. 34.08.255.   Amendment of a declaration where fewer than 50 percent of unit owners approve.

(a) If a declaration requires owners having more than 50 percent of the votes in the association in a single class voting structure or unit owners having more than 50 percent of the votes in more than one class in a voting structure with more than one class to vote in favor of an amendment in order to amend a declaration, the association or a unit owner may petition the superior court for the judicial district in which the common interest community is located for an order reducing the percentage of the affirmative votes necessary for the adoption of the amendment.  The petition shall describe the efforts that have been made to solicit the approval of the unit owners in the association in the manner required by the declaration, the number of affirmative and negative votes actually received, the number of percentage of affirmative votes required to adopt the amendment under the declaration, and any other matter the petitioner considers relevant to the determination of the court.  The petition must include as exhibits to the petition a copy of

(1) the governing documents;

(2) a complete text of the amendments;

(3) a copy of each notice and the solicitation materials used in the solicitation of the approval of the amendment by the unit owners;

(4) an explanation of the reason for the amendment;

(5) other documentation relevant to the determination by the court.

(b) When the petition is filed with the superior court, the court shall set the matter for hearing and issue an ex parte order setting out the manner in which notice shall be given to the unit owners in the association.

(c) The court may, but is not required to, grant the petition if it finds that

(1) the petitioner has given not less than 15 days' written notice of the court hearing to

(A) each unit owner in the association;

(B) a mortgagee of a mortgage or beneficiary of a deed of trust that is entitled to notice under the provisions of the declaration; and

(C) the municipality in which the common interest community is located if it is entitled to notice under the declaration;

(2) the balloting on the proposed amendment was conducted under each of the applicable provisions of the declaration, bylaws, and rules or regulations of the association;

(3) a reasonably diligent effort was made to permit each eligible unit owner to vote on the proposed amendment;

(4) in a common interest community with a single class voting structure, unit owners with more than 50 percent of the votes voted in favor of the amendment;

(5) in a voting structure with more than one class and where the declaration requires a majority of more than one class to vote in favor of the amendment, unit owners having more than 50 percent of the votes in each class required by the declaration to vote in favor of the amendment did vote in favor of the amendment;

(6) the amendment is reasonable; and

(7) granting the petition is appropriate considering the circumstances.

(d) If the court makes the findings required in (c) of this section, an order issued under this section may

(1) confirm the amendment as being validly approved on the basis of the affirmative votes actually received during the balloting period; or

(2) dispense with a requirement relating to quorums or to the percentage of votes needed for approval of an amendment under the governing documents.

(e) A court may not approve an amendment to a declaration under this section that

(1) would change the provision in a declaration requiring the approval of unit owners having more than 50 percent of the votes in more than one class to vote in favor of an amendment unless more than 50 percent of the unit owners in each affected class of unit owners approve the amendment;

(2) would eliminate a special right, preference, or privilege designated in the declaration as belonging to the declarant without the approval of the declarant; or

(3) would impair the security interest of a mortgagee of a mortgage or the beneficiary of a deed of trust without the approval of the percentage of the mortgagees and beneficiaries specified in the declaration if the declaration requires the approval of a specified percentage of the mortgagees and beneficiaries.

(f) An amendment to the declaration approved under this section is not effective until the order of the court and the amendment have been recorded in each recording district in which a portion of the common interest community is located.  The amendment may be acknowledged by, and the court order and amendment may be recorded by, an individual designated in the declaration or by the association and, if no one is designated for that purpose, by the president of the association.  On the recording of the amendment and the court order, the declaration, as amended under this section, has the same force and effect as if the amendment were adopted in compliance with the declaration.

(g) Within a reasonable time after the recording of the amendment under (f) of this section, the association shall mail a copy of the amendment to each unit owner in the association together with a statement that the amendment has been recorded.

###### Sec. 34.08.260.   Termination of common interest community.

(a) Unless all units are taken by eminent domain, or unless there has been a foreclosure of a security interest that has priority over the declaration against an entire cooperative, a common interest community may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units comprising either at least 80 percent of the votes in the association or any larger percentage specified in the declaration.  The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.

(b) An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement or ratification of an agreement to terminate, in the same manner as a deed is executed by the required number of unit owners.  The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date.  A termination agreement and each ratification of the termination agreement must be recorded in each recording district in which a portion of the common interest community is situated.  A termination agreement is effective only upon recording.

(c) If a condominium or planned community contains only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide that all of the common elements and units of the common interest community must be sold following termination.  If, under the agreement, any real estate in the common interest community is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set out the minimum terms of the sale.

(d) If a condominium or planned community contains a unit not having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide for sale of the common elements, but it may not require that the unit be sold following termination unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or unless all unit owners consent to the sale.

(e) The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real estate in a common interest community, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved under (a) and (b) of this section.  If real estate is to be sold following termination, title to the real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. The association has at that time all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale.  Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds of the sale distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination.  Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lien holders as their interests may appear under (h), (i), and (j) of this section.  Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and the successor in interest of each unit owner has an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.  During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and the successors in interest of each unit owner remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the declaration.

(f) In a condominium or planned community, if the real estate constituting the common interest community is not to be sold following termination, title to the common elements and, in a common interest community containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real estate in the common interest community, vests in the unit owners upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests under (j) of this section, and liens on the units shift accordingly.  While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and the successors in interest of each unit owner have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.

(g) Following termination of the common interest community, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear.

(h) Following termination of a condominium or planned community, a creditor of the association holding a lien on the units that was reduced to judgment and recorded before termination, may enforce the lien in the same manner as any other lien holder. Each other creditor of the association shall be treated as if the creditor had perfected a lien on the units immediately before termination.

(i) In a cooperative, the declaration may provide that each creditor of the association has priority over the interests of unit owners and creditors of unit owners.  In that event, following termination, a creditor of the association holding a lien on the cooperative that was reduced to judgment and recorded before termination may enforce the lien in the same manner as a lien holder, and each other creditor of the association shall be treated as if the creditor had perfected a lien against the cooperative immediately before termination.  Unless the declaration provides that all creditors of the association have that priority (1) the lien of each creditor of the association that was perfected against the association before termination becomes, upon termination, a lien against the interest of each unit owner in the unit as of the date the lien was perfected; (2) any other creditor of the association shall be treated upon termination as if the creditor had perfected a lien against the interest of each unit owner immediately before termination; (3) the amount of the lien of an association's creditor described in (1) and (2) of this subsection against the interest of each unit owner must be proportionate to the ratio which the common expense liability of each unit bears to the common expense liability of all of the units; (4) the lien of each creditor of each unit owner that was perfected before termination continues as a lien against the unit as of the date the lien was perfected; and (5) the assets of the association must be distributed to each unit owner and each lien holder as their interests may appear in the order described in this section.  Creditors of the association are not entitled to payment from a unit owner in excess of the amount of the creditor's lien against the interest of the unit owner.

(j) The respective interests of each unit owner referred to in (e)§(i) of this section are as follows:

(1) except as provided in (2) of this subsection, the respective interest of each unit owner is the fair market value of the unit, allocated interests, and any limited common elements immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association; the decision of the independent appraisers must be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unit owners of units comprising 25 percent of the allocated interests in the association; the proportion of each unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of the unit and its allocated interests by the total fair market value of all units and their allocated interests;

(2) if a unit or a limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value of the unit or the limited common interest before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are,

(A) in a condominium, their respective common element interests immediately before the termination;

(B) in a cooperative, their respective ownership interests immediately before the termination; and

(C) in a planned community, their respective common expense liabilities immediately before the termination.

(k) In a condominium or planned community, except as provided in (l) of this section, foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire common interest community does not, of itself, terminate the common interest community, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the common interest community, other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw the portion from the common interest community. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not withdraw, of itself, the real estate from the common interest community, but the person taking title to the real estate may require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the common interest community.

(l) In a condominium or planned community, if a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the common interest community has priority over the declaration and the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance, upon foreclosure, may record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to the lien or encumbrance from the common interest community.

(m) A declaration that specifies a termination date but that does not contain a provision for the extension of the termination date may be extended

(1) by the approval of the unit owners having more than 50 percent of the votes in the association;

(2) by the approval of the unit owners having the percentage of votes as specified in the declaration for an amendment to the declaration; or

(3) if the approval of unit owners having more than 50 percent of the votes in the association is required to amend the declaration, under AS 34.08.255.

(n) An amendment to a declaration under (m) of this section becomes effective when it has been recorded in each recording district in which a portion of the common interest community is located.

(o) A single extension of the terms of a declaration made under this section may not exceed the initial term of the declaration or 20 years, whichever is less.  More than one extension of the term may occur under this section.

###### Sec. 34.08.270.   Rights of secured lenders.

(a) A financial institution, including a commercial bank, mutual savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union and mortgage company when acting as an ordinary money lender, whether secured or not, and providing financing for a common interest community subject to the provisions of this chapter or to a declarant, unit owner, or purchaser for that person's interest subject to the provisions of this chapter, is not liable under this chapter to a person for an act, omission, warranty, product or structural defect, obligation, breach of contract or other duty arising from common interest community financing.

(b) For purposes of this section, "acting as an ordinary money lender" means a non-negligent action including, but not limited to, property inspections, review of public offering statements, approval of declarations, plats and construction plans and requiring proof of compliance with laws or codes to protect a lender's security interest or otherwise assure the proper use of or repayment of its loan.  A lender does not act as an ordinary money lender when it is an affiliate of the declarant or possesses a direct equity interest other than an interest foreclosed upon in the promotion, development, and sale of a common interest.

(c) A declaration may require that all or a specified number or percentage of the lenders who hold security interests encumbering the units approve specified actions of the unit owners or the association as a condition to the effectiveness of the action, but a requirement for approval does not operate to

(1) deny or delegate control over the general administrative affairs of the association by the unit owners or the executive board;

(2) prevent the association or the executive board from commencing, intervening in, or settling any litigation or proceeding; or

(3) prevent an insurance trustee or the association from receiving and distributing insurance proceeds except under AS 34.08.440.

###### Sec. 34.08.280.   Master associations.

(a) If the declaration provides that a power described in AS 34.08.320 is to be exercised by or may be delegated to a profit or nonprofit corporation that exercises those or other powers on behalf of one or more common interest communities or for the benefit of the unit owners of one or more common interest communities, each provision of this chapter applicable to a unit owners' association applies to the corporation, except as modified by this section.

(b) Unless it is acting in the capacity of an association described in AS 34.08.310, a master association may exercise the powers set out in AS 34.08.320(a)(2) only to the extent expressly permitted in the declarations of common interest communities that are part of the master association or expressly described in the delegation of power from the common interest communities to the master association.

(c) If the declaration of a common interest community provides that the executive board may delegate certain powers to a master association, the members of the executive board of the common interest community are not liable for an act or omission of the master association with respect to the delegated powers following the delegation.

(d) The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners' association under AS 34.08.330, 34.08.390, 34.08.400, 34.08.410, and 34.08.430 apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association only to persons who elect the board of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this chapter.

(e) If a master association is also an association described in AS 34.08.310, the certificate of incorporation or other instrument creating the master association and each declaration of a common interest community that had assigned powers by the declaration or that has delegated powers to the master association, may provide that the executive board of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in one of the following ways:

(1) each unit owner of all common interest communities subject to the master association may elect all members of the executive board of the master association;

(2) the members of the executive boards of all common interest communities subject to the master association may elect the members of the executive board of the master association;

(3) the unit owners of each common interest community subject to the master association may elect specified members of the executive board of the master association;

(4) the members of the executive board of each common interest community subject to the master association may elect specified members of the executive board of the master association.

###### Sec. 34.08.290.   Merger or consolidation of common interest communities.

(a) Any two or more common interest communities of the same form of ownership, by agreement of the unit owners under (b) of this section, may be merged or consolidated into a single common interest community.  On the merger or consolidation, unless the agreement otherwise provides, the resulting common interest community is the legal successor, for all purposes, of the preexisting common interest communities, and the operations and activities of each association of the preexisting common interest communities are merged or consolidated into a single association that holds all powers, rights, obligations, assets, and liabilities of all preexisting associations.

(b) An agreement of two or more common interest communities to merge or consolidate under (a) of this section must be evidenced by an agreement prepared, executed, recorded, and certified by the president of the association of each of the preexisting common interest communities following approval by owners of units comprising the percentage of votes in each common interest community required to terminate the common interest community.  The agreement must be recorded in each recording district in which a portion of the common interest community is located and is not effective until recorded.

(c) Each merger or consolidation agreement must provide for the reallocation of the allocated interests in the new association among the units of the resultant common interest community either (1) by stating the reallocations or the formulas upon which they are based or (2) by stating the percentage of overall allocated interests of the new common interest community that are allocated to all of the units comprising each of the preexisting common interest communities, and providing that the portion of the percentages allocated to each unit formerly comprising a part of the preexisting common interest community must be equal to the percentages of allocated interests allocated to the unit by the declaration of the preexisting common interest community.

###### Sec. 34.08.300.   Addition of unspecified real estate.

In a planned community, if the right is originally reserved in the declaration, the declarant, in addition to any other development right, may amend the declaration at any time during as many years as are specified in the declaration for adding additional real estate to the planned community without describing the location of the real estate in the original declaration.  The amount of real estate added to the planned community under this section may not exceed 10 percent of the real estate described in AS 34.08.130(a)(3) and the declarant may not in any event increase the number of units in the planned community beyond the number stated in the original declaration under AS 34.08.130(a)(4).

#### Article 3. Management of the Common Interest Community.

###### Sec. 34.08.310.   Organization of unit owners' association.

An association of unit owners must be organized no later than the date on which the first unit in the common interest community is conveyed.  The membership of the association at all times consists exclusively of all unit owners or, following termination of the common interest community, of all former unit owners entitled to distributions of proceeds under AS 34.08.260 or their heirs, successors, or assigns.  The association must be organized as a profit or nonprofit corporation, trust, or partnership.

###### Sec. 34.08.320.   Powers of unit owners' association.

(a) Except as provided in (b) of this section and subject to the provisions of the declaration, the association may

(1) adopt and amend bylaws and rules and regulations;

(2) adopt and amend budgets for revenues, expenditures, and reserves and collect assessments for common expenses from unit owners;

(3) hire and discharge managing agents and other employees, agents, and independent contractors;

(4) institute, defend, or intervene in litigation or administrative proceedings or seek injunctive relief for violations of its declaration, bylaws, or rules in its own name on behalf of itself or two or more unit owners on matters affecting the common interest community;

(5) make contracts and incur liabilities;

(6) regulate the use, maintenance, repair, replacement, and modification of common elements;

(7) cause additional improvements to be made as a part of the common elements;

(8) acquire, hold, encumber, and convey in its own name any right, title, or interest to real estate or personal property, except that

(A) common elements in a condominium or planned community may be conveyed or subjected to a security interest only under AS 34.08.430; and

(B) part of a cooperative may be conveyed or all or part of a cooperative may be subjected to a security interest only under AS 34.08.430;

(9) grant easements, leases, licenses, and concessions through or over the common elements;

(10) impose and receive a payment, fee, or charge for the use, rental, or operation of the common elements, other than limited common elements described in AS 34.08.100(2) and (4), and for services provided to unit owners;

(11) impose a reasonable charge for late payment of assessments and, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, levy a reasonable fine for a violation of the declaration, bylaws, rules, and regulations of the association;

(12) impose a reasonable charge for the preparation and recording of an amendment to the declaration, the filing and recording of a plat or plan that accompanies an amendment, resale certificate required by AS 34.08.590, or a statement of unpaid assessments;

(13) provide for the indemnification of its officers and executive board and maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance;

(14) assign its right to future income, including the right to receive common expense assessments, but only to the extent the declaration expressly permits the assignment;

(15) exercise any other powers conferred by the declaration or bylaws;

(16) exercise any other power that may be exercised in the state by a legal entity of the same type as the association; and

(17) exercise any other power necessary and proper for the governance and operation of the association.

(b) The declaration may not impose limitations on the power of the association to deal with the declarant that are more restrictive than the limitations imposed on the power of the association to deal with other persons.

###### Sec. 34.08.330.   Executive board members and officers.

(a) Except as provided in the declaration, the bylaws, (b) of this section, or other provisions of this chapter, the executive board may act in all instances on behalf of the association. In the performance of their duties, the officers and members of the executive board are required to exercise the care required of fiduciaries of the unit owners.

(b) The executive board may not act on behalf of the association to amend the declaration, to terminate the common interest community, or to elect members of the executive board or determine the qualifications, powers and duties, or terms of office of executive board members, but the executive board may fill vacancies in its membership for the unexpired portion of a term.

(c) Within 30 days after adoption of a proposed budget for the common interest community, the executive board shall provide a summary of the budget to each unit owner, and shall set a date for a meeting of the unit owners to consider ratification of the budget not less than 14 nor more than 30 days after mailing of the summary.  Unless at that meeting a majority of all unit owners or any larger vote specified in the declaration reject the budget, the budget is ratified, whether or not a quorum is present.  If the proposed budget is rejected, the periodic budget last ratified by the unit owners continues until the unit owners ratify a budget proposed by the executive board.

(d) Subject to (e) of this section, the declaration may provide for a period of declarant control of the association, during which a declarant or persons designated by the declarant may appoint and remove the officers and members of the executive board.  Regardless of the period provided in the declaration, a period of declarant control terminates no later than the earlier of: (1) 60 days after conveyance of 75 percent of the units that may be created to unit owners other than a declarant; (2) two years after all declarants have ceased to offer units for sale in the ordinary course of business; or (3) two years after any right to add new units was last exercised.  A declarant may voluntarily surrender the right to appoint and remove officers and members of the executive board before termination of the periods established in this subsection, but in that event the declarant may require, for the duration of the period of declarant control, that specified actions of the association or executive board, as described in a recorded instrument executed by the declarant, be approved by the declarant before they become effective.

(e) Not later than 60 days after conveyance of 25 percent of the units that may be created to unit owners other than a declarant, at least one member and not less than 25 percent of the members of the executive board must be elected by unit owners other than the declarant.  Not later than 60 days after conveyance of 50 percent of the units that may be created to unit owners other than a declarant, not less than 331/3 percent of the members of the executive board must be elected by unit owners other than the declarant.

(f) Except as otherwise provided in AS 34.08.280(e), not later than the termination of any period of declarant control, the unit owners shall elect an executive board. The executive board consists of at least three members, except that if there are fewer than 12 units in the common interest community, the declaration may provide for an executive board with one or two members.  At least a majority of the members of the executive board must be unit owners.  The executive board shall elect the officers.  The executive board members and officers take office upon election.

(g) Notwithstanding any provision of the declaration or bylaws to the contrary, following notice under AS 34.08.390, the unit owners, by a two-thirds vote of all persons present and entitled to vote at a meeting of the unit owners at which a quorum is present, may remove a member of the executive board with or without cause, other than a member appointed by the declarant.

###### Sec. 34.08.340.   Transfer of association control.

(a) Before or not more than 60 days after the termination of declarant control, the declarant shall relinquish control of the common interest community and the unit owners shall accept control.  At the same time, the declarant shall deliver to the common interest community all property of the unit owners and of the common interest community held or controlled by the declarant including, but not limited to

(1) the original or a photocopy of the recorded declaration and each amendment to the declaration; if a photocopy is provided, it shall be certified by affidavit of the declarant, or an officer or agent of the declarant, as being a complete copy of the actual recorded declaration;

(2) a certified copy of the common interest community articles of incorporation, trust or partnership agreement;

(3) a copy of the bylaws;

(4) the minute books, including all minutes, and other books and records of the common interest community;

(5) the rules and regulations that have been adopted;

(6) resignations of officers and members of the executive board who are required to resign because the declarant is required to relinquish control of the common interest community;

(8) common interest community funds or control of the funds of the common interest community;

(9) all tangible personal property that is property of the common interest community, represented by the declarant to be the property of the association or ostensibly the property of the association and an inventory of the property;

(10) a copy of the plans and specifications utilized in the construction or remodeling of improvements and the supplying of equipment to the common interest community and in the construction and installation of all mechanical components serving the improvements and the site, with a certificate in affidavit form of the declarant or an architect or engineer authorized to practice in the state that the plans and specifications represent, to the best of their knowledge and belief, the actual plans and specifications utilized in the construction and improvement of the common interest community property and for the construction and installation of the mechanical components serving the improvements;

(11) insurance policies;

(12) copies of any certificates of occupancy that may have been issued for the common interest community property;

(13) any other permits issued by governmental bodies applicable to the common interest community property in force or issued within one year before the date the unit owners other than the declarant take control of the common interest community;

(14) all written warranties of the contractor, subcontractors, suppliers, and manufacturers, if any, that are still effective;

(15) a roster of unit owners and their addresses and telephone numbers, if known, as shown on the declarant's records;

(16) leases of the common elements and other leases to which the association is a party;

(17) employment contracts or service contracts in which the common interest community is one of the contracting parties or service contracts in which the common interest community or the unit owners have an obligation or responsibility, directly or indirectly, to pay some or all of the fee or charge of the person performing the service;

(18) all other contracts to which the common interest community is a party.

(b) The records shall be reviewed by an independent certified public accountant.  The minimum report required is a review in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards as defined by regulation by the Board of Public Accountancy.  The accountant performing the review shall examine to the extent necessary supporting documents and records, including the cash disbursements and related paid invoices to determine if expenditures were for the common interest community purposes and the billings, cash receipts, and related records to determine that the declarant was charged and paid the proper amounts of assessments.

(c) Before the transfer of control from the declarant to the association, an inspection of the common areas and limited common areas subject to the association's control shall be completed by

(1) an independent registered engineer, architect, or land surveyor;

(2) an appraiser with the designation of senior residential appraiser, senior real property appraiser, or senior real estate analyst of the Society of Real Estate Appraisers;

(3) a residential member, or member of the appraisal institute, of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers; or

(4) an individual with a designation established by regulation of the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation for fee appraisers who certify the completion of construction.

(d) A report shall be prepared indicating the incomplete work and repairs needed and the method of completing the work and making the repairs.  The transfer of control to the association shall be based upon the declarant's obligation to complete all repairs and finish all incomplete work within a reasonable time after transfer of control under representations in the public offering statement.

###### Sec. 34.08.350.   Transfer of special declarant rights.

(a) A special declarant right created or reserved under this chapter may be transferred only by an instrument evidencing the transfer that has been recorded in each recording district in which any portion of the common interest community is located. The instrument is not effective unless executed by the transferee.

(b) Upon transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor declarant is as follows:

(1) a transferor is not relieved of an obligation or liability arising before the transfer and remains liable for warranty obligations imposed by this chapter; lack of privity does not deprive a unit owner of standing to maintain an action to enforce an obligation of the transferor;

(2) if a successor to a special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant, the transferor is jointly and severally liable with the successor for an obligation or liability of the successor relating to the common interest community;

(3) if a transferor retains a special declarant right but transfers other special declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for an obligation or liability imposed on a declarant by this chapter or by the declaration relating to the retained special declarant right and arising after the transfer;

(4) a transferor is not liable for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor.

(c) Unless otherwise provided in a mortgage instrument, deed of trust, or other agreement creating a security interest, on the foreclosure of a security interest, sale by a trustee under an agreement creating a security interest, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under Bankruptcy Act or receivership proceedings of a unit owned by a declarant or of real estate in a common interest community subject to development rights, the person acquiring title to the property being foreclosed or sold, but only upon the request of the person, succeeds either (1) to the special declarant rights related to the property held by the declarant, or (2) only to any rights reserved in the declaration under AS 34.08.230 and held by that declarant to maintain models, sales offices, and signs.  The judgment or instrument conveying title must provide for transfer of only the special declarant rights requested.

(d) Upon foreclosure of a security interest, sale by a trustee under an agreement creating a security interest, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under Bankruptcy Act or receivership proceedings, of the interests in a common interest community owned by a declarant

(1) the declarant ceases to have special declarant rights, and

(2) the period of declarant control terminates unless the judgment or instrument conveying title provides for transfer of the special declarant rights held by the declarant to a successor declarant.

(e) The liabilities and obligations of a person who succeeds to special declarant rights are as follows:

(1) a successor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to the obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this chapter or by the declaration;

(2) a successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor described in (3) or (4) of this subsection or a successor who is an affiliate of a declarant, is subject to the obligations and liabilities imposed by this chapter or the declaration

(A) on a declarant that relate to the successor's exercise or nonexercise of special declarant rights; or

(B) on the transferor, other than

(i) misrepresentations by a previous declarant;

(ii) warranty obligations on improvements made by a previous declarant or made before the common interest community was created;

(iii) breach of a fiduciary obligation by a previous declarant or the appointees of a previous declarant to the executive board; or

(iv) a liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the acts or omissions of the transferor after the transfer;

(3) a successor to a right reserved in the declaration only to maintain models, sales offices, and signs may not exercise any other special declarant right and is not subject to liability or obligation as a declarant except the obligation to provide a public offering statement and liability arising as a result of the statement;

(4) a successor to the special declarant rights held by a transferor who succeeded to the rights under a deed or other instrument of conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or under a judgment or instrument conveying title under (c) of this section may declare in a recorded instrument, including one conveying title under (c) of this section

(A) an intention to hold the rights solely for transfer to another person; or

(B) an intention to hold the rights for transfer to another person after making, finishing, or completing improvements in conformity with the declaration, consistent with the public offering statement, plans, and overall development scheme of the common interest community for purposes of preserving or improving the common interest community.

(f) Until transferring the special declarant rights to a person acquiring title to a unit or real estate subject to the development rights owned by the successor, or until recording an instrument permitting exercise of all those rights, the successor may not exercise any of the rights other than those specified in (e)(4)(B) of this section and the right held by the transferor of the successor to control the executive board under AS 34.08.330(d) for the duration of any period of declarant control and an attempted exercise of rights is void.

(g) So long as a successor declarant may not exercise special declarant rights under (e) of this section, and for purposes of (e)(4)(B) of this section so long as the successor declarant transfers within the time period specified in (h) of this section the rights to a subsequent successor declarant who will assume liability for the improvements made by the successor declarant, the successor declarant is not subject to liability or obligation as a declarant other than liability for acts and omissions under AS 34.08.330(d).

(h) If a lender fails to transfer special declarant rights to a successor declarant within one year of the date of recording an instrument under (e)(4)(B) of this section, then the lender becomes subject to the obligations and liabilities imposed by this chapter or the declaration as specified in (e)(2) of this section.

(i) Nothing in this section subjects a successor to a special declarant right to a claim against or other obligation of a transferor declarant, other than a claim or obligation arising under this chapter or the declaration.

###### Sec. 34.08.360.   Termination of contracts and leases of declarant.

(a) If entered into before the executive board elected by the unit owners under AS 34.08.330(f) takes office (1) a management contract, employment contract, or lease of recreational or parking areas or facilities; (2) a contract or lease between the association and a declarant or an affiliate of a declarant; or (3) a contract or lease that is not bona fide or was unconscionable to the unit owners at the time entered into under the circumstances then prevailing may be terminated without penalty by the association at any time after the executive board elected by the unit owners under AS 34.08.330(f) takes office upon not less than 90 days' notice to the other party.

(b) This section does not apply to

(1) a lease if a termination of the lease would terminate the common interest community or reduce its size, unless the real estate subject to the lease was included in the common interest community for the purpose of avoiding the right of the association to terminate a lease under this section; or

(2) a proprietary lease.

###### Sec. 34.08.370.   Bylaws.

(a) The bylaws of the association must provide

(1) for the number of the members of the executive board and for the titles of the officers of the association;

(2) for the election by the executive board of a president, treasurer, secretary, and other officers of the association specified by the bylaws;

(3) for the qualifications, powers and duties, terms of office, and manner of electing and removing executive board members and officers and filling vacancies;

(4) which, if any, of its powers the executive board or officers may delegate to other persons or to a managing agent;

(5) which of its officers may prepare, execute, certify, and record amendments to the declaration on behalf of the association; and

(6) for a method of amending the bylaws.

(b) Subject to the provisions of the declaration, the bylaws may provide for any other matters the association considers necessary and appropriate.

###### Sec. 34.08.380.   Upkeep of common interest community.

(a) Except to the extent provided by the declaration, by (b) of this section, or by AS 34.08.440(h), the association is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of the common elements, and each unit owner is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of the unit.  Each unit owner shall afford to the association, the other unit owners, and to their agents or employees, access through the unit that is reasonably necessary for maintenance and repair of the unit.  If damage is inflicted on the common elements or on any unit through which access is taken, the unit owner responsible for the damage, or the association if it is responsible, is liable for the prompt repair of the damage.

(b) In addition to the liability that a declarant as a unit owner has under this chapter, a declarant is solely liable for the expenses in connection with real estate subject to development rights.  No other unit owner and no other portion of the common interest community is subject to a claim for payment of expenses in connection with development rights.  Unless the declaration provides otherwise, the income and proceeds from real estate subject to development rights inures to the declarant.

(c) In a planned community, when all development rights have expired with respect to real estate, the declarant remains liable for the expenses of the real estate unless, upon expiration, the declaration provides that the real estate becomes common elements or units.

###### Sec. 34.08.390.   Meetings.

A meeting of the association must be held at least once each year.  A special meeting of the association may be called by the president, by a majority of the members of the executive board, or by unit owners comprising either 20 percent or a lower percentage specified in the bylaws of the votes in the association.  Not less than 10 nor more than 60 days in advance of a meeting, the secretary or other officer specified in the bylaws shall cause notice to be hand-delivered or sent prepaid by United States mail to the mailing address of each unit or to the mailing address designated in writing by the unit owner.  The notice of a meeting must state the time and place of the meeting and the items on the agenda, including the general nature of a proposed amendment to the declaration or bylaws, budget changes, and a proposal to remove an officer or member of the executive board.

###### Sec. 34.08.400.   Quorums.

(a) Unless the bylaws provide otherwise, a quorum is present throughout a meeting of the association if persons entitled to cast 20 percent of the votes that may be cast for election of the executive board are present in person or by proxy at the beginning of the meeting.

(b) Unless the bylaws specify a larger percentage, a quorum is considered present throughout a meeting of the executive board if persons entitled to cast 50 percent of the votes on the board are present at the beginning of the meeting.

###### Sec. 34.08.410.   Voting and proxies.

(a) If only one of several owners of a unit is present at a meeting of the association, the owner present is entitled to cast all the votes allocated to the unit.  If more than one of the owners are present, the votes allocated to the unit may be cast only in accordance with the agreement of a majority in interest of the owners, unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise. There is majority agreement if any one of the owners casts the votes allocated to the unit without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by another owner of the unit.

(b) Votes allocated to a unit may be cast under a proxy duly executed by a unit owner.  If a unit is owned by more than one person, each owner of the unit may vote or register protest to the casting of votes by the other owners of the unit through a duly executed proxy.  A unit owner may revoke a proxy given under this section only by actual notice of revocation to the person presiding over a meeting of the association.  A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable without notice.  A proxy terminates one year after its date, unless it specifies a shorter term.

(c) If the declaration requires that votes on specified matters affecting the common interest community be cast by lessees rather than unit owners of leased units (1) the provisions of (a) and (b) of this section apply to lessees as if they were unit owners; (2) unit owners who have leased their units to other persons may not cast votes on the specified matters; and (3) lessees are entitled to notice of meetings, access to records, and other rights respecting the matters as if they were unit owners.  Unit owners must also be given notice under AS 34.08.390, of all meetings at which lessees are entitled to vote.

(d) Votes allocated to a unit owned by the association may not be cast.

###### Sec. 34.08.420.   Tort and contract liability.

Neither the association nor any unit owner except the declarant is liable for the torts of the declarant in connection with any part of the common interest community that the declarant has the responsibility to maintain.  An action alleging a wrong done by the association must be brought against the association and not against a unit owner.  If the wrong occurred during a period of declarant control and the association gives the declarant reasonable notice of and an opportunity to defend against the action, the declarant who then controlled the association is liable to the association or to a unit owner for (1) tort losses not covered by insurance suffered by the association or the unit owner, and (2) each cost that the association would not have incurred but for a breach of contract or other wrongful act or omission. If the declarant is liable to the association under this section, the declarant is liable for the expenses of litigation incurred by the association.  A statute of limitation affecting the right of action of the association under this section is tolled until the period of declarant control terminates.  A unit owner is not precluded from maintaining an action under this section because the person is a unit owner or a member or officer of the association.  A lien resulting from a judgment against the association is governed by AS 34.08.480.

###### Sec. 34.08.430.   Conveyance or encumbrance of common elements.

(a) In a condominium or planned community, portions of the common elements may be conveyed or subjected to a security interest by the association if persons entitled to cast at least 80 percent of the votes in the association, including 80 percent of the votes allocated to units not owned by a declarant, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to the action, but each owner of a unit to which a limited common element is allocated must agree in order to convey the limited common element or subject it to a security interest.  The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if each of the units is restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. The proceeds of the sale and proceeds of a loan secured by encumbering a common area are an asset of the association.

(b) Part of a cooperative may be conveyed and all or part of a cooperative may be subjected to a security interest by the association if persons entitled to cast at least 80 percent of the votes in the association, including 80 percent of the votes allocated to units not owned by a declarant, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to the action, but, if fewer than all of the units or limited common elements are to be conveyed or subjected to a security interest, then each unit owner of the units to which the limited common elements are allocated must agree in order to convey the units or limited common elements or subject them to a security interest.  The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if each of the units is restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.  The proceeds of the sale and proceeds of a loan secured by encumbering a common area are an asset of the association.  A purported conveyance or other voluntary transfer of an entire cooperative, unless made under AS 34.08.260, is void.

(c) An agreement to convey common elements in a condominium or planned community or to subject the common elements to a security interest and an agreement to convey any part of a cooperative or subject the cooperative to a security interest must be evidenced by the execution of an agreement, or ratifications of the agreement, in the same manner as a deed by the requisite number of unit owners. The agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless recorded before the date.  The agreement and each ratification of the agreement must be recorded in each recording district in which a portion of the common interest community is situated and is effective only upon recording.

(d) The association on behalf of the unit owners may contract to convey an interest in common interest community under (a) of this section, but the contract is not enforceable against the association until approved under (a)§(c) of this section. After approval under (a)§(c) of this section, the association has the powers necessary and appropriate to effect the conveyance or encumbrance, including the power to execute a deed or other instrument.

(e) Unless made under this section, a purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary transfer of common elements or of any other part of a cooperative is void.

(f) A conveyance or encumbrance of common elements or of a cooperative under this section does not deprive a unit of its rights of access and support.

(g) Unless the declaration provides otherwise, a conveyance or encumbrance of common elements under this section does not affect the priority or validity of preexisting encumbrances.

(h) In a cooperative, the association may acquire, hold, encumber, or convey a proprietary lease without complying with this section.

###### Sec. 34.08.440.   Insurance.

(a) Commencing not later than the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available,

(1) property insurance on the common elements and, in a planned community, on property that must become common elements, insuring against all risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against or, in the case of conversion property, against fire and extended coverage perils, and the total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles must be not less than 100 percent of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations, and other items normally excluded from property policies; and

(2) liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than an amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury, and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership, or maintenance of the common elements and, in cooperatives, of each unit.

(b) In the case of a building that is part of a cooperative or that contains a unit having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, the insurance maintained under (a)(1) of this section, to the extent reasonably available, must include the unit, but need not include improvements and betterments installed by a unit owner.

(c) If the insurance described in (a) and (b) of this section is not reasonably available, the association promptly shall cause notice of the fact to be hand-delivered or sent prepaid by United States mail to each unit owner.  The declaration may require the association to carry other insurance, and the association in any event may carry other insurance it considers appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.

(d) Insurance policies carried under (a) and (b) of this section must provide that

(1) each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of interest of the unit owner in the common elements or membership in the association;

(2) the insurer waives the right to subrogation under the policy against a unit owner or member of the household of a unit owner;

(3) an act or omission by a unit owner, unless acting within the scope of the unit owner's authority on behalf of the association, will not void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy; and

(4) if, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the policy of the association provides primary insurance.

(e) A loss covered by the property policy under (a)(1) and (b) of this section must be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for the loss are payable to an insurance trustee designated for the purpose or to the association and not to a holder of a security interest.  The insurance trustee or the association shall hold insurance proceeds in trust for the association, unit owners, and lien holders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of (h) of this section, the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property, and the association, unit owners, and lien holders are not entitled to receive payment of a portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored or unless the common interest community is terminated.

(f) An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for the benefit of the unit owner.

(g) An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to a unit owner or holder of a security interest.  The insurer issuing the policy may not cancel or refuse to renew it until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation or nonrenewal has been mailed to the association, each unit owner, and each holder of a security interest to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their last known addresses.

(h) A portion of the common interest community for which insurance is required under this section that is damaged or destroyed must be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless: the common interest community is terminated and  AS 34.08.260 applies; repairs or replacement would be illegal under a state statute or municipal ordinance governing health or safety; or 80 percent of the unit owners, including each owner of a unit or assigned limited common element that will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild.  The cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves is a common expense.  If the entire common interest community is not repaired or replaced, (1) the insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements must be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the common interest community, and (2) except to the extent that other persons will be distributees, (A) the insurance proceeds attributable to a unit and limited common elements that are not rebuilt must be distributed to the owner of the unit and the owner of the unit to which the limited common elements were allocated, or to lien holders, as their interests may appear, and (B) the remainder of the proceeds must be distributed to each unit owner or lien holder, as their interests may appear, as follows: (i) in a condominium, in proportion to the common element interest of all the units and (ii) in a cooperative or planned community, in proportion to the common expense liabilities of all the units.  If the unit owners vote not to rebuild a unit, the allocated interests of the unit are reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under  AS 34.08.740(a), and the association promptly shall prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations, and file and record a plat or plan that accompanies the amendment.

(i) The provisions of this section may be varied or waived in a common interest community if all of the units are restricted to nonresidential use.

###### Sec. 34.08.450.   Surplus funds.

Unless otherwise provided in the declaration, surplus funds of the association remaining after payment of or provision for common expenses and prepayment of reserves must be paid to the unit owners in proportion to common expense liabilities or credited to them to reduce future common expense assessments.

###### Sec. 34.08.460.   Assessments for common expenses.

(a) Until the association makes a common expense assessment, the declarant shall pay all common expenses. After an assessment has been made by the association, assessments must be made at least annually, based on a budget adopted at least annually by the association.

(b) Except for assessments under (c)§(e) of this section, all common expenses must be assessed against each unit in accordance with the allocations set out in the declaration under AS 34.08.150(a) and (b).  A past due common expense assessment or an installment of the assessment bears interest at the rate established by the association not exceeding 18 percent per year.

(c) To the extent required by the declaration

(1) a common expense associated with the maintenance, repair, or replacement of a limited common element must be assessed against each unit to which that limited common element is assigned, equally, or in proportion provided by the declaration;

(2) a common expense or portion of the common expense benefiting fewer than all of the units must be assessed exclusively against the units benefited;

(3) the costs of insurance must be assessed in proportion to risk; and

(4) the costs of utilities that can be determined must be assessed in proportion to usage and if the costs of utilities cannot be determined, the cost of nondeterminable utilities shall be shared as a common expense.

(d) An assessment to pay a judgment against the association may be made only against the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was entered, in proportion to their common expense liabilities.

(e) If a common expense is caused by the misconduct of a unit owner, the association may assess that expense exclusively against the unit.

(f) If common expense liabilities are reallocated, common expense assessments and any installment of the assessment not yet due must be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated common expense liabilities.

###### Sec. 34.08.470.   Lien for assessments.

(a) The association has a lien on a unit for an assessment levied against the unit or fines imposed against its unit owner from the time the assessment or fine becomes due.  Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees, charges, late charges, fines, and interest charged under  AS 34.08.320(a)(10)§(12) are enforceable as assessments under this section.  If an assessment is payable in installments, the full amount of the assessment is a lien from the time the first installment becomes due.

(b) A lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a unit except (1) a lien and encumbrance recorded before the recordation of the declaration and, in a cooperative, a lien and encumbrance which the association creates, assumes, or takes subject to; (2) a first security interest on the unit recorded before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent, or, in a cooperative, the first security interest encumbering only the interest of the unit owner and perfected before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent; and (3) a lien for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the unit or cooperative.  A lien under this section is also prior to all security interests described in (2) of this subsection if the common expense assessments based on the periodic budget adopted by the association under  AS 34.08.460(a) would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce the lien.  This subsection does not affect the priority of a mechanic's or materialman's lien, or the priority of a lien for other assessments made by the association.  A lien under this section is not subject to the provisions of  AS 09.38.010.

(c) Unless the declaration provides otherwise, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same property, each lien has equal priority.

(d) The recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien.  Further recording of a claim of lien for assessment under this section is not required.

(e) A lien for an unpaid assessment is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien are instituted within three years after the full amount of the assessment becomes due.

(f) This section does not prohibit an action to recover sums for which (a) of this section creates a lien or prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.

(g) A judgment or decree in an action brought under this section is enforceable by execution under  AS 09.35.010.

(h) The association upon written request shall furnish to a unit owner a statement setting out the amount of unpaid assessments against the unit.  If the interest of the unit owner is real estate, the statement must be in recordable form.  The statement must be furnished within 10 business days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the executive board, and each unit owner.

(i) In a cooperative, upon nonpayment of an assessment on a unit, a unit owner may be evicted in the same manner as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a commercial tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed under this section.

(j) The association's lien may be foreclosed under this subsection as follows:

(1) in a condominium or planned community, the lien of the association must be foreclosed as a lien is foreclosed under  AS 34.35.005;

(2) in a cooperative whose unit owners' interests in the units are real estate, the lien of the association must be foreclosed as a mortgage or deed of trust on real estate is foreclosed or as a lien is foreclosed under  AS 34.35.005; or

(3) in a cooperative whose unit owners' interests in the units are personal property, the lien of the association must be foreclosed as a security interest under  AS 45.29.

(k) In a cooperative, if the interest of the unit owner in a unit is real estate,

(1) the association, upon nonpayment of an assessment and compliance with this subsection, may sell the unit at a public sale or by private negotiation, and at any time and place; each aspect of the sale, including the method, advertising, time, place, and terms must be reasonable; the association shall give reasonable written notice to the unit owner and a lessee of the unit owner of the time and place of the public sale or, if a private sale is intended, of the intention of entering into a contract to sell and of the time after which a private disposition may be made; the same notice must also be sent to any other person who has a recorded interest in the unit that would be cut off by the sale, but only if the recorded interest was on record seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date of a public sale or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may be made; the notices required by this subsection may be sent to any address reasonable in the circumstances; sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice; the association may buy at a public sale and, if the sale is conducted by a fiduciary or other person not related to the association, at a private sale;

(2) unless otherwise agreed, the debtor is liable for any deficiency in a foreclosure sale under  AS 09.45.170;

(3) the proceeds of a foreclosure sale must be applied in the following order:

(A) the reasonable expenses of sale;

(B) the reasonable expenses of securing possession before sale including holding, maintaining, and preparing the unit for sale, payment of taxes and other governmental charges, premiums on hazard and liability insurance;

(C) satisfaction of the lien of the association;

(D) satisfaction in the order of priority of a subordinate claim of record; and

(E) remittance of any excess to the unit owner;

(4) a good faith purchaser for value acquires the unit free of the association's debt that gave rise to the lien under which the foreclosure sale occurred and any subordinate interest, even though the association or other person conducting the sale failed to comply with the requirements of this section; the person conducting the sale shall execute a conveyance to the purchaser sufficient to convey the unit and stating that it is executed after a foreclosure of the association's lien by power of sale and that person conducting the sale was empowered to make the sale; signature and title or authority of the person signing the conveyance as grantor and a recital of the facts of nonpayment of the assessment and of the giving of the notices required by this subsection are sufficient proof of the facts recited and of the authority of the person to sign; further proof of authority is not required even if the association is named as grantee in the conveyance;

(5) at any time before the association has disposed of a unit in a cooperative or entered into a contract for its disposition under the power of sale, the unit owner or the holder of a subordinate security interest may cure the default of the unit owner and prevent sale or other disposition by tendering the performance due under the security agreement, including an amount due because of exercise of a right to accelerate, plus the reasonable expenses of proceeding to foreclosure incurred to the time of tender.

###### Sec. 34.08.480.   Other liens.

(a) In a condominium or planned community,

(1) except as provided in (2) of this subsection, a recorded judgment for money against the association is not a lien on the common elements, but is a lien in favor of the judgment lien holder against the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was entered and no other property of a unit owner is subject to the claims of creditors of the association;

(2) if the association has granted a security interest in the common elements to a creditor of the association under AS 34.08.430, the holder of the security interest shall exercise its right against the common elements before its judgment lien on a unit may be enforced;

(3) whether perfected before or after the creation of the common interest community, if a lien, other than a deed of trust or mortgage including a judgment lien or lien attributable to work performed or materials supplied before creation of the common interest community, becomes effective against two or more units, the unit owner of an affected unit may pay to the lien holder the amount of the lien attributable to the unit, and the lien holder, upon receipt of payment, shall promptly deliver a release of the lien covering the unit; the amount of the payment must be proportionate to the ratio that the unit owner's common expense liability bears to the common expense liabilities of all unit owners whose units are subject to the lien; after payment, the association may not assess or have a lien against the unit owner's unit for any portion of the common expenses incurred in connection with the lien;

(4) a judgment against the association must be indexed in the name of the common interest community and the association and, when so indexed, is notice of the lien against the units.

(b) In a cooperative,

(1) if the association receives notice of an impending foreclosure on all or a portion of the association's real estate, the association shall promptly transmit a copy of the notice to each unit owner of a unit located within the real estate to be foreclosed; a failure of the association to transmit the notice does not affect the validity of the foreclosure;

(2) whether or not the property of a unit owner is subject to the claims of creditors of the association, other property of a unit owner is not subject to the claims.

###### Sec. 34.08.490.   Association records.

(a) The association shall keep financial records sufficiently detailed to enable the association to comply with AS 34.08.590.  Financial and other records must be made reasonably available for examination by a unit owner and an authorized agent of a unit owner.

(b) A professional manager, managing agent, accountant, or other person with whom the association has contracted for services shall return all association records within five days of the termination of the contract.  If the association records are not returned within five days, the association may sue for their return and for damages.

###### Sec. 34.08.500.   Association as trustee.

If a third person deals with the association in the capacity of the association as a trustee, the existence of trust powers and their proper exercise by the association may be assumed without inquiry.  A third person is not bound to inquire whether the association has power to act as trustee or is properly exercising trust powers. A third person, without actual knowledge that the association is exceeding or improperly exercising its powers, is fully protected in dealing with the association as if it possessed and properly exercised the powers it purports to exercise.  A third person is not bound to assure the proper application of trust assets paid or delivered to the association in its capacity as trustee.

#### Article 4. Protection of Purchasers.

###### Sec. 34.08.510.   Applicability.

(a) The provisions of AS 34.08.510 § 34.08.700 apply to all units subject to this chapter, except as provided in (b) of this section or as modified or waived by agreement of purchasers of units in a common interest community in which each unit is restricted to nonresidential use.

(b) A public offering statement and a resale certificate are not required to be prepared or delivered on

(3) a disposition by a governmental agency;

(4) a disposition by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure;

(5) a disposition to a dealer;

(6) a disposition that may be canceled at any time and for any reason by the purchaser without penalty;

(7) a disposition of a unit in a planned community in which the declaration limits the maximum annual assessment of a unit to not more than $300, as adjusted under AS 34.08.820, if

###### Sec. 34.08.590.   Resales of units.

(a) Except for a sale in which delivery of a public offering statement is required, or unless the sale is exempt under AS 34.08.510(b), a unit owner shall furnish to a purchaser before execution of a contract for sale of a unit or before conveyance a copy of the declaration, as amended, the bylaws, the rules or regulations of the association, and a certificate containing a statement disclosing

(b) The association, within 10 days after a written request by a unit owner and the payment of a reasonable fee, shall furnish a certificate containing the information necessary to enable the unit owner to comply with this section.  A unit owner providing a certificate under (a) of this section is not liable to the purchaser for erroneous information provided by the association and included in the certificate.

(c) A purchaser is not liable for an unpaid assessment or fee greater than the amount set out in the certificate prepared by the association.

(2) delivered to the declarant because of the purchaser's default under a contract to purchase the unit; or

(3) refunded to the purchaser.

###### Sec. 34.08.610.   Release of liens.

(a) In a sale of a unit where delivery of a public offering statement is required under AS 34.08.520(c), a seller before conveying a unit shall record and furnish to the purchaser a release of each lien, except a lien on real estate that a declarant has the right to withdraw from the common interest community, that the purchaser does not expressly agree to take subject to or assume and that encumbers

(1) in a condominium, the unit and its common element interest; or

(2) in a cooperative or planned community, the unit and any limited common elements assigned to the unit.

(b) Before conveying real estate to the association, the declarant shall have the real estate released from

(1) each lien the foreclosure of which would deprive unit owners of a right of access to or easement of support of their units; and

(2) each other lien on the real estate unless the public offering statement describes certain real estate that may be conveyed subject to liens in specified amounts.

###### Sec. 34.08.620.   Conversion property.

(a) A declarant of a common interest community containing conversion property, and any dealer who intends to offer units in a common interest community containing conversion units, shall give each residential tenant and each residential subtenant in possession of a portion of conversion property notice of the conversion and provide each person with the public offering statement no later than 180 days before the tenant and any subtenant in possession are required to vacate.  If the conversion property consists of a mobile home park, notice of the conversion and delivery of a public offering statement shall be provided no later than one year before the tenant and any subtenant in possession are required to vacate. The notice must set out generally the rights of tenants and subtenants under this section and shall be hand delivered to the tenant or subtenant in possession or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant and subtenant at the address of the unit or any other mailing address provided by a tenant.  The failure to give notice as required by this section is a defense to an action for possession and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered during the notice period provided by this subsection.  A tenant or subtenant may not be required to vacate upon less than 180 days' notice and a tenant and a subtenant in possession in a mobile home park may not be required to vacate upon less than one year's notice except for one of the following reasons:

(1) the tenant or subtenant has defaulted in the payment of rent owed;

(2) the tenant or subtenant has been convicted of violating a federal or state law or local ordinance, and that violation is continuing and is detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of other dwellers or tenants in the mobile home park; and

(3) the tenant or subtenant has violated a provision, enforceable under AS 34.03.130, of the rental agreement or lease signed by both parties and not prohibited by law including rent and the terms of agreement.

(b) For 90 days after delivery or mailing of the notice described in (a) of this section, the person required to give the notice shall offer to convey each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use to the tenant who leases or rents the unit. If a tenant fails to purchase the unit during the 90-day period, the offeror shall extend a right of first refusal to the tenant who is leasing or renting the unit at the time of the conversion.  The offeror may not offer to dispose of an interest in the unit at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant while the tenant is in possession.  The tenant must exercise the right of first refusal within 90 days from the receipt of the offer and must provide the offeror a valid letter of intent or a preliminary loan commitment from a bank or mortgage lending institution within 30 days of receipt of the offer. This subsection does not apply to a unit in conversion property if the unit will be restricted exclusively to nonresidential use or if the boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimensions of the residential unit before conversion.

(c) If a seller, in violation of (b) of this section, conveys a unit for value to a purchaser who has no knowledge of the violation, the recording of the deed conveying the unit or, in a cooperative, the conveyance of the unit, extinguishes any right a tenant may have under (b) of this section to purchase the unit if the deed states that the seller has complied with (b) of this section, but the conveyance does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the seller for a violation of (b) of this section.

(d) If a notice of conversion specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated and otherwise complies with the provisions of AS 09.45.060 §09.45.160, the notice also constitutes a notice to quit.

(e) Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease by a declarant in violation of its terms.

###### Sec. 34.08.630.   Express warranties of quality.

(a) An express warranty made by a seller to a purchaser of a unit, if relied upon by the purchaser, is created as follows:

(1) any affirmation of fact or promise that relates to the unit, its use, or rights appurtenant to the unit, area improvements to the common interest community that would directly benefit the unit, or the right to use or have the benefit of facilities not located in the common interest community, creates an express warranty that the unit and related rights and uses will conform to the affirmation or promise;

(2) a model or description of the physical characteristics of the common interest community, including plans and specifications of or for improvements, creates an express warranty that the common interest community will conform to the model or description;

(3) a description of the quantity or extent of the real estate comprising the common interest community, including plats of surveys, creates an express warranty that the common interest community will conform to the description, subject to customary tolerances; and

(4) a provision that a purchaser may put a unit only to a specified use is an express warranty that the specified use is lawful.

(b) Formal words such as "warranty" or "guarantee" and the specific intention to make a warranty are not necessary to create an express warranty of quality, but a statement purporting to be merely an opinion or commendation of the real estate or its value does not create a warranty.

(c) A conveyance of a unit transfers to the purchaser each express warranty of quality made by a previous seller.

###### Sec. 34.08.640.   Implied warranties of quality.

(a) A declarant and a dealer warrant that a unit will be in at least as good condition at the earlier of the time of the conveyance or delivery of possession as it was at the time of contracting, reasonable wear and tear excepted.

(b) A declarant and a dealer impliedly warrant that a unit and the common elements in the common interest community are suitable for the ordinary uses of real estate of its type and that any improvements made or contracted for by the declarant or dealer, or made by any person before the creation of the common interest community, will be

(1) free from defective materials; and

(2) constructed in accordance with applicable law, according to sound engineering and construction standards, and in a skillful and workmanlike manner.

(c) A declarant and a dealer warrant to a purchaser of a unit that may be used for residential use that an existing use, continuation of which is contemplated by the parties, does not violate applicable law at the earlier of the time of conveyance or delivery of possession.

(d) Warranties imposed by this section may be excluded or modified under AS 34.08.650.

(e) For purposes of this section, improvements made or contracted for by an affiliate of a declarant are made or contracted for by the declarant.

(f) A conveyance of a unit transfers to the purchaser all of the declarant's implied warranties of quality.

###### Sec. 34.08.650.   Exclusion or modification of implied warranties of quality.

(a) Except as limited by (b) of this section with respect to a purchaser of a unit that may be used for residential use, implied warranties of quality

(1) may be excluded or modified by written agreement of the parties; and

(2) are excluded by a written expression of disclaimer such as "as is," "with all faults," or other language that in common understanding calls the attention of the purchaser to the exclusion of warranties.

(b) With respect to a purchaser of a unit that may be occupied for residential use, a general disclaimer of implied warranties of quality is not effective, but a declarant and a dealer may disclaim liability in an instrument signed by the purchaser for a specified defect or specified failure to comply with applicable law, if the defect or failure entered into and became a part of the basis of the bargain.

###### Sec. 34.08.660.   Statute of limitations for warranties.

(a) A judicial proceeding for breach of an obligation arising under AS 34.08.630 or 34.08.640 must be commenced within six years after the cause of action accrues, but the parties may agree to reduce the period of limitation to not less than two years.  If the unit may be occupied for residential use, an agreement to reduce the period of limitation must be evidenced by a separate instrument executed by the purchaser.

(b) Subject to (c) of this section, a cause of action for breach of warranty of quality, regardless of the purchaser's lack of knowledge of the breach, accrues

(1) as to a unit, at the time the purchaser to whom the warranty is first made enters into possession if a possessory interest was conveyed or at the time of acceptance of the instrument of conveyance if a nonpossessory interest was conveyed; and

(2) as to each common element, at the time the common element is completed or, if later, as to

(A) a common element that may be added to the common interest community or a portion of the common interest community, at the time the first unit is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; or

(B) a common element within any other portion of the common interest community, at the time the first unit is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser.

(c) If a warranty of quality explicitly extends to future performance or duration of an improvement or component of the common interest community, the cause of action accrues at the time the breach is discovered or at the end of the warranty period, whichever is earlier.

###### Sec. 34.08.670.   Effect of violations on rights of action.

If a declarant or any other person subject to this chapter fails to comply with a provision of this chapter or with a provision of the declaration or bylaws, a person or class of persons adversely affected by the failure to comply has a claim for appropriate relief.  Punitive damages may be awarded for a wilful failure to comply with this chapter.

###### Sec. 34.08.680.   Labeling of promotional material.

Promotional material may not be displayed or delivered to a prospective purchaser that describes or portrays an improvement that is not in existence unless the description or portrayal of the improvement in the promotional material is conspicuously labeled or identified either as "MUST BE BUILT" or as "NEED NOT BE BUILT."

(b) The declarant is liable for the prompt repair and restoration, to a condition compatible with the remainder of the common interest community, of a portion of the common interest community affected by the exercise of rights reserved under or created by AS 34.08.180, 34.08.190, 34.08.200, 34.08.210, 34.08.230, or 34.08.240.

###### Sec. 34.08.700.   Substantial completion of units.

In the sale of a unit for which delivery of a public offering statement is required, a contract of sale may be executed, but an interest in the unit may not be conveyed until the declaration is recorded, a plat or plan that accompanies the declaration is filed and recorded, and the unit is substantially completed as evidenced by issuance of a certificate of occupancy authorized by law or by a recorded certificate of substantial completion executed by

(a) In a cooperative, the interest of a unit owner in a unit and its allocated interests is real estate for all purposes, except that the real estate constituting the cooperative shall be assessed and taxed as a whole and the interest of a unit owner may not be separately taxed.

(b) In a condominium or planned community,

(1) if there is a unit owner other than a declarant, each unit that has been created, together with its interest in the common elements, constitutes for all purposes a separate parcel of real estate;

(2) if there is a unit owner other than a declarant, each unit shall be separately taxed and assessed, and a separate tax or assessment may not be rendered against any common elements for which a declarant has reserved no development rights.

(c) Any portion of the common elements for which the declarant has reserved a development right shall be separately taxed and assessed against the declarant and the declarant alone is liable for payment of the taxes.

(d) If there is no unit owner other than a declarant, the real estate comprising the common interest community may be taxed and assessed in any manner provided by law.

###### Sec. 34.08.730.   Applicability of local ordinances, regulations, and building codes.

(a) If a unit is acquired by eminent domain or part of a unit is acquired by eminent domain leaving the unit owner with a remnant that may not practically or lawfully be used for any purpose permitted by the declaration, the award must include compensation to the unit owner for that unit and its allocated interests, whether or not any common elements are acquired. Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides, the allocated interests of the unit are automatically reallocated to the remaining units in proportion to the respective allocated interests of those units before the taking, and the association shall promptly prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations, and file and record a plat or plan that accompanies the amendment. A remnant of a unit remaining after part of a unit is taken under this subsection is a common element from that time.

(b) Except as provided in (a) of this section, if part of a unit is acquired by eminent domain, the award must compensate the unit owner for the reduction in value of the unit and its interest in the common elements, whether or not any common elements are acquired.  Upon acquisition, unless the decree provides otherwise,

(1) the allocated interests of the unit are reduced either in proportion to the reduction in the size of the unit or on the basis specified in the declaration; and

(2) the portion of the allocated interests divested from the partially acquired unit are automatically reallocated to the unit and to the remaining units in proportion to the respective allocated interests of the units before the taking, with the partially-acquired unit participating in the reallocation on the basis of its reduced allocated interests.

(c) If part of the common elements is acquired by eminent domain, the portion of the award attributable to the common elements taken must be paid to the association. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, any portion of the award attributable to the acquisition of a limited common element must be equally divided among the owners of the units to which that limited common element was allocated at the time of acquisition.

(d) The court decree must be recorded in each recording district in which any portion of the common interest community is located.

(e) On a condemnation of a unit or common area, an award or decree must include a reasonable amount to cover the cost of reallocating the allocatable interests of the unit owners.

###### Sec. 34.08.750.   Supplemental general principles of law applicable.

The principles of law and equity, including the law of corporations and unincorporated associations, the law of real property, and the law relative to capacity to contract, principal and agent, eminent domain, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, receivership, substantial performance, or other validating or invalidating cause supplement the provisions of this chapter except to the extent inconsistent with this chapter.

###### Sec. 34.08.760.   Construction against implicit repeal.

This chapter is a general act intended as a unified coverage of its subject matter and a part of the chapter may not be construed to be impliedly repealed by subsequent legislation if that construction can reasonably be avoided.

###### Sec. 34.08.770.   Uniformity of application and construction.

This chapter shall be applied and construed so as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of the chapter among states enacting it.

###### Sec. 34.08.780.   Severability.

If a provision of this chapter or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are severable.

###### Sec. 34.08.790.   Unconscionable agreement or term of contract.

(a) Upon finding as a matter of law that a contract or contract clause was unconscionable at the time the contract was made, a court may refuse to enforce the contract, may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or may limit the application of the unconscionable clause in order to avoid an unconscionable result.

(b) Whenever it is claimed or appears to the court that a contract or a contract clause is or may be unconscionable, the parties, in order to aid the court in making the determination, must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to (1) the commercial setting of the negotiations; (2) whether a party has knowingly taken advantage of the inability of another party reasonably to protect personal interests by reason of physical or mental infirmity, illiteracy, inability to understand the language of the agreement, or similar factors; (3) the effect and purpose of the contract or clause; and (4) any gross disparity, if a sale, at the time of contracting, between the amount charged for the property and the value of the property measured by the price at which similar property was readily obtainable in similar transactions.  A disparity between the contract price and the value of the property measured by the price at which similar property was readily obtainable in similar transactions does not, of itself, render the contract unconscionable.

###### Sec. 34.08.800.   Obligation of good faith.

A contract or duty governed by this chapter imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement.

###### Sec. 34.08.810.   Remedies to be liberally administered.

The Index for December, 1979, which was 230, is the Reference Base Index.

(b) The dollar amounts specified in AS 34.08.030 and 34.08.510(b)(7) and any amount stated in the declaration pursuant to those sections change on July 1 of each year if the percentage of change, calculated to the nearest whole percentage point, between the Index at the end of the preceding year and the Reference Base Index is 10 percent or more, except that

(1) the portion of the percentage change in the Index in excess of a multiple of 10 percent shall be disregarded and the dollar amounts shall change only in multiples of 10 percent of the amounts appearing in this chapter on January 1, 1986;

(2) the dollar amounts may not change if the amounts required by this section are those currently in effect under this chapter as a result of an earlier application of this section; and

(3) in no event may the dollar amounts be reduced below the amounts appearing in this chapter on January 1, 1986.

(c) If the Index is revised after December 1979, the percentage of change under this section shall be calculated on the basis of the revised Index.  If the revision of the Index changes the Reference Base Index, a revised Reference Base Index must be determined by multiplying the Reference Base Index then applicable by the rebasing factor furnished by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  If the Index is superseded, the index referred to in this section is the one represented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as reflecting most accurately changes in the purchasing power of the dollar for consumers.

###### Sec. 34.08.830.   Transfer of unit in a cooperative.

If a unit in a cooperative is owned by a unit owner or is sold, conveyed, voluntarily or involuntarily encumbered, or otherwise transferred by the unit owner, the interest in the unit that is owned, sold, conveyed, encumbered, or otherwise transferred is the right to possession of the unit under a proprietary lease, coupled with the allocated interests of the unit, and the association's interest in the unit is not affected by the transfer.

The deed or conveyance is sufficient in law to convey the legal title to the premises described in it from the grantor to the grantee when the deed or conveyance is otherwise sufficient, and

#### Article 2. Deeds of Trust.

###### Sec. 34.20.070.   Sale by trustee.

(a) If a deed of trust is executed conveying real property located in the state to a trustee as security for the payment of an indebtedness and the deed provides that in case of default or noncompliance with the terms of the trust, the trustee may sell the property for condition broken, the trustee, in addition to the right of foreclosure and sale, may execute the trust by sale of the property, upon the conditions and in the manner set forth in the deed of trust, without first securing a decree of foreclosure and order of sale from the court, if the trustee has complied with the notice requirements of (b) of this section. If the deed of trust is foreclosed judicially or the note secured by the deed of trust is sued on and a judgment is obtained by the beneficiary, the beneficiary may not exercise the nonjudicial remedies described in this section.

(b) Not less than 30 days after the default and not less than 90 days before the sale, the trustee shall record in the office of the recorder of the recording district in which the trust property is located a notice of default setting out (1) the name of the trustor, (2) the book and page where the trust deed is recorded or the serial number assigned to the trust deed by the recorder, (3) a description of the trust property, including the property's street address if there is a street address for the property, (4) a statement that a breach of the obligation for which the deed of trust is security has occurred, (5) the nature of the breach, (6) the sum owing on the obligation, (7) the election by the trustee to sell the property to satisfy the obligation, (8) the date, time, and place of the sale, and (9) the statement described in (e) of this section describing conditions for curing the default. An inaccuracy in the street address may not be used to set aside a sale if the legal description is correct. At any time before the sale date stated in the notice of default or to which the sale is postponed under AS 34.20.080(e), if the default has arisen by failure to make payments required by the trust deed, the default may be cured and sale under this section terminated by payment of the sum then in default, other than the principal that would not then be due if no default had occurred, and attorney and other foreclosure fees and costs actually incurred by the beneficiary and trustee due to the default. If, under the same trust deed, notice of default under this subsection has been recorded two or more times previously and the default has been cured under this subsection, the trustee may elect to refuse payment and continue the sale.

(c) Within 10 days after recording the notice of default, the trustee shall mail a copy of the notice by certified mail to the last known address of each of the following persons or their legal representatives: (1) the trustor in the trust deed; (2) the successor in interest to the trustor whose interest appears of record or of whose interest the trustee or the beneficiary has actual notice, or who is in actual physical possession of the property; (3) any other person actually in physical possession of the property; (4) any person having a lien or interest subsequent to the interest of the trustee in the trust deed, where the lien or interest appears of record or where the trustee or the beneficiary has actual notice of the lien or interest, except as provided in (f) of this section. The notice may be delivered personally instead of by mail.

(d) If the State of Alaska is a subsequent party, the trustee, in addition to the notice of default, shall give the state a supplemental notice of any state lien existing as of the date of filing the notice of default. This notice must set out, with such particularity as reasonably available information will permit, the nature of the state's lien, including the name and address, if known, of the person whose liability created the lien, the amount shown on the lien document, the department of the state government involved, the recording district, and the book and page on which the lien was recorded or the serial number assigned to the lien by the recorder.

(e) The statement required by (b)(9) of this section must state that, if the default has arisen by failure to make payments required by the trust deed, the default may be cured and the sale under this section terminated if

(1) payment of the sum then in default, other than the principal that would not then be due if default had not occurred, and attorney and other foreclosure fees and costs actually incurred by the beneficiary and trustee due to the default is made at any time before the sale date stated in the notice of default or to which the sale is postponed; and

(2) when notice of default under (b) of this section has been recorded two or more times previously under the same trust deed and the default has been cured under (b) of this section, the trustee does not elect to refuse payment and continue the sale.

(f) In (c)(4) of this section, if the existence of a lien or nonpossessory interest can only be inferred from an inspection of the real property, the person holding the lien or nonpossessory interest is not entitled to notice under (c) of this section unless the lien or nonpossessory interest appears of record or a written notice of the lien or nonpossessory interest has been given to the beneficiary or trustee before the recording of the notice of default.

(g) If the trustee delivers notice personally under (c) of this section to the property or to an occupant of the property, the trustee may, notwithstanding (c) of this section, deliver the notice up to 20 days after the notice of default is recorded. If there is not a structure on the property and a person is not present on the property at the time of delivery, the trustee may place the notice on the property, or as close as practicable to the property if

(1) there is not a practical road access to the property; or

(2) access to the property is restricted by gates or other barriers.

(h) If the trustee or other person who delivered notice under (g) of this section signs an affidavit for the delivery, the affidavit is prima facie evidence that the trustee complied with (g) of this section. After one year from the delivery, as evidenced by the affidavit, the trustee is conclusively presumed to have complied with (g) of this section unless, within one year from the delivery, an action has been filed in court to contest the foreclosure based on failing to comply with (g) of this section.

(i) If a person who is entitled to receive notice by mail under (c) of this section is known by the beneficiary or trustee to be deceased, the trustee may satisfy the notice requirements of (c) of this section by mailing the notice to the last known address of the deceased person and to the personal representative of the deceased person if the beneficiary or trustee knows that a personal representative has been appointed for the deceased person.

(j) If a person who is entitled to receive notice by mail under (c) of this section is known by the beneficiary or trustee to be deceased but the trustee and the beneficiary do not know that a personal representative has been appointed for the deceased person, the trustee may satisfy the notice requirements of (c) of this section by

(1) mailing the notice to the heirs and devisees of the deceased person

(A) whose names and addresses are known to the beneficiary or trustee; or

(B) who have recorded a notice of their interest in the property; and

(2) publishing and posting the notice of the foreclosure as provided by law for the sale of real property on execution, except that the notice must be titled "To the Heirs or Devisees of (insert the name of the deceased person)" and include in the body of the notice a list of the names of the persons who are known by the beneficiary or trustee to be the heirs and devisees of the deceased person.

(k) If notice is given as required by (i) and (j) of this section, an heir or devisee of the deceased person may not challenge the foreclosure on the ground that the heir or devisee did not receive notice of the sale, unless the heir or devisee challenges the foreclosure on this ground within 90 days after the sale.

(l) A person may bring an action in court to enjoin a foreclosure on real property only if the person is

(1) the trustor of the deed of trust under which the real property was foreclosed;

(2) a guarantor of the obligation that the real property is securing;

(3) a person who has an interest in the real property that has been recorded;

(4) a person who has a recorded lien against the real property;

(5) an heir to the real property;

(6) a devisee of the real property; or

(7) the attorney general acting under other legal authority.

(m) If a person brings an action under (l) of this section to stop a sale of real property, and if the sale is being brought because of a default in the performance of a nonmonetary obligation required by the deed of trust that the real property is securing, the court may impose on the person the conditions that the court determines are appropriate to protect the beneficiary.

(n) In this section, "devisee," "heir," and "personal representative" have the meanings given in AS 13.06.050.

###### Sec. 34.20.080.   Sale at public auction.

(a) The sale authorized in AS 34.20.070 shall be made under the terms and conditions and in the manner set out in the deed of trust. The proceeds from a sale shall be placed in a trust account until they are disbursed. However, the sale shall be made

(1) at public auction held at the front door of a courthouse of the superior court in the judicial district where the property is located, unless the deed of trust specifically provides that the sale shall be held in a different place, except that a trustee may also accept bids by telephone, the Internet, and electronic mail if the trustee has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the bidding methods using the telephone, the Internet, or electronic mail are fair, accessible, and designed to result in money that is immediately available for disbursement; and

(2) after public notice of the time and place of the sale has been given in the manner provided by law for the sale of real property on execution.

(b) The attorney for the trustee or another agent of the trustee may conduct the sale and act in the sale as the auctioneer for the trustee. The trustee may set reasonable rules and conditions for the conduct of the sale. Sale shall be made to the highest and best bidder. The beneficiary under the trust deed may bid at the trustee's sale. Except as provided by (g) of this section, the trustee shall execute and deliver to the purchaser a deed to the property sold.

(c) The deed must recite the date and the book and page of the recording of default, and the mailing or delivery of the copies of the notice of default, the true consideration for the conveyance, the time and place of the publication of notice of sale, and the time, place, and manner of sale, and refer to the deed of trust by reference to the page, volume, and place of record or to the place of record and the serial number assigned to the deed of trust by the recorder.

(d) After the sale an affidavit of mailing the notice of default and an affidavit of publication of the notice of sale shall be recorded in the mortgage records of the recording district where the property is located.

(e) The trustee may postpone sale of all or any portion of the property by delivering to the person conducting the sale a written and signed request for the postponement to a stated date and hour. The person conducting the sale shall publicly announce the postponement to the stated date and hour at the time and place originally fixed for the sale. This procedure shall be followed in any succeeding postponement, but the foreclosure may not be postponed for more than 12 months unless a new notice of the sale is given under (a)(2) of this section. A sale may be postponed for up to 12 months from the sale date stated in the notice of default under AS 34.20.070(b) without providing a basis for challenging the validity of the foreclosure process because of the length of time the foreclosure has been pending.

(f) After delivery of a deed under (b) of this section, the trustee shall distribute any cash proceeds of the sale in the following order to

(1) the beneficiary of the deed of trust being foreclosed until the beneficiary is paid the full amount that is owed under the deed of trust to the beneficiary;

(2) the persons who held, at the time of the sale, recorded interests, except easements, in the property, that were subordinate to the foreclosed deed of trust; the distribution under this paragraph shall be made according to the priority of the recorded interest, and a recorded interest with a higher priority shall be satisfied before distribution is made to the recorded interest that is next lower in priority; however, if a person holds a recorded interest that is an assessment, the person is entitled only to the amount of the assessment that was due at the time of the sale; in this paragraph, "recorded interest" means an interest, including a lease, recorded under AS 40.17;

(3) the trustor in the trust deed if the trustor is still the owner of the property at the time of the foreclosure sale, but, if the trustor is not still the owner of the property at the time of the foreclosure sale, then to the trustor's successor in interest whose interest appears of record at the time of the foreclosure sale.

(g) The trustee may withhold delivery of the deed under (b) of this section for up to 10 days after the sale. If, during the 10 days, the trustee determines that the sale should not have proceeded, the trustee may not issue the deed but shall

(1) inform the beneficiary, the otherwise successful bidder, and the trustor of the trust deed or the trustor's successor in interest that the sale is rescinded; and

(2) return to the otherwise successful bidder money received from the otherwise successful bidder as a bid on the property; return of this money is the otherwise successful bidder's only remedy if the trustee withholds delivery of the deed under (b) of this section.

(h) If a trustee rescinds a sale under (g) of this section and the obligation secured by the deed of trust remains in default, the trustee may, at the request of the beneficiary, reschedule the sale for a date that is not less than 45 days after the date of the rescinded sale. Not less than 30 days before the rescheduled sale date, the trustee shall

(1) mail notice of the rescheduled sale date by certified mail to the last known address of each of the persons identified by AS 34.20.070(c); and

(2) publish and post the notice of the rescheduled sale date as provided by law for the sale of real property on execution.

(i) Unless a sale is rescinded under (g) of this section, the sale completely terminates the rights of the trustor of the trust deed in the property.

(j) If a sale is rescinded under (g) of this section, the deed of trust foreclosed in the rescinded sale is restored to the validity and priority it would have had as though the sale had not occurred.

###### Sec. 34.20.090.   Title, interest, possessory rights, and redemption.

(a) The sale and conveyance transfers all title and interest that the party executing the deed of trust had in the property sold at the time of its execution, together with all title and interest that party may have acquired before the sale, and the party executing the deed of trust or the heirs or assigns of that party have no right or privilege to redeem the property, unless the deed of trust so declares.

(b) The purchaser at a sale and the heirs and assigns of the purchaser are, after the execution of a deed to the purchaser by the trustee, entitled to the possession of the premises described in the deed as against the party executing the deed of trust or any other person claiming by, through or under that party, after recording the deed of trust in the recording district where the property is located.

(c) A recital of compliance with all requirements of law regarding the mailing or personal delivery of copies of notices of default in the deed executed under a power of sale is prima facie evidence of compliance with the requirements.  The recital is conclusive evidence of compliance with the requirements in favor of a bona fide purchaser or encumbrancer for value and without notice.

###### Sec. 34.20.100.   Deficiency judgment prohibited.

When a sale is made by a trustee under a deed of trust, as authorized by AS 34.20.070 § 34.20.130, no other or further action or proceeding may be taken nor judgment entered against the maker or the surety or guarantor of the maker, on the obligation secured by the deed of trust for a deficiency.

###### Sec. 34.20.110.   Trust deeds recorded as mortgages.

For the purposes of record, a deed of trust, given to secure an indebtedness, shall be treated as a mortgage of real estate, and recorded in full in the book provided for mortgages of real property.

###### Sec. 34.20.115.   Procedure for reconveyance.

(1) a memorandum of the payment is recorded in the office of the recording district where the property is located;

(2) the memorandum is recorded before the end of the statutory time for bringing an action upon the existing contract and extensions as exhibited by the terms of the recorded instrument; and

This option must be stated in writing within the note or as a separate document. If a note executed after May 24, 1988 fails to contain the notice specified in this section, the debt secured by the mortgage or deed of trust may be foreclosed under AS 09.45.170§09.45.220 or AS 34.20.070§34.20.135.

For purposes of this subsection, the period in which the power must be exercised or the power terminated is computed from the time of creation of the original power of appointment under which a subsequent general power of appointment not presently exercisable or a subsequent nongeneral power of appointment not presently exercisable was created.

(b) If a nongeneral power of appointment is exercised to create a new presently exercisable general power of appointment, all property interests subject to that new presently exercisable general power of appointment are invalid unless, within 1,000 years after the creation of the new presently exercisable general power of appointment, the property interests that are subject to the new presently exercisable general power of appointment either vest or terminate.

(b) If a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment was created before January 1, 1996, and is determined in a judicial proceeding, commenced on or after that date, to violate this state's rule against perpetuities as that rule existed before January 1, 1996, or if a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment was created on or after January 1, 1996, but before April 2, 1997, and is determined in a judicial proceeding, commenced on or after that date, to violate this state's rule against perpetuities as that rule existed, on or after January 1, 1996, and before April 2, 1997, a court, upon the petition of an interested person, may reform the disposition in the manner that most closely approximates the transferor's manifested plan of distribution and is within the limits of the rule against perpetuities applicable when the nonvested property interest or power of appointment was created. For purposes of this subsection, a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by the exercise of a power of appointment is created when the power is irrevocably exercised or when a revocable exercise becomes irrevocable.

(c) The provisions of AS 34.27.051 apply to a trust instrument or conveyance executed on or after April 2, 1997, if the trust instrument or conveyance creates a contingent power of appointment or nonvested property interest subject to the exercise of a power of appointment that creates a new or successive power of appointment.

(a) A mistake in formality or lack of statement in the lien notice or the pleadings is not ground for dismissal or unnecessary delay in an action to foreclose a lien.

(b) Substantial compliance with the law relating to the contents of the lien notice is considered sufficient, if the notice satisfactorily shows the name of the claimant, the amount of the demand, the time of the employment, the property sought to be charged with the lien sufficient for identification, and the name of the owner or reputed owner of the property.

(c) The inclusion of nonlienable items in the amount of the claimant's demand or error in the terms and conditions of the contract of employment, if there is a contract of employment, or other error in the lien notice, made in good faith, is not considered material, unless the error affects the substantial rights of the adverse party, acquired in good faith without notice.

(d) The lien notice and pleadings may be amended at any time before judgment.  If a material statement or averment is omitted or misstated, this is ground for a reasonable delay or continuance to enable opposing parties to meet the amendment, and a nonsuit or dismissal may not be entertained in the action except upon the merits of the cause.

#### Article 2. Mechanics and Materialmen.

###### Sec. 34.35.050.   Lien for labor or materials furnished.

A person has a lien, only to the extent provided under this chapter, to secure the payment of the contract price if the person

(1) performs labor upon real property at the request of the owner or the agent of the owner for the construction, alteration, or repair of a building or improvement;

(2) is a trustee of an employee benefit trust for the benefit of individuals performing labor on the building or improvement and has a direct contract with the owner or the agent of the owner for direct payments into the trust;

(3) furnishes materials that are delivered to real property under a contract with the owner or the agent of the owner that are incorporated in the construction, alteration, or repair of a building or improvement;

###### Sec. 34.35.055.   Land subject to lien.

(a) The land upon which a building or other improvement described in AS 34.35.050 is constructed, together with a convenient space about the building or other improvement or so much as is required for the convenient use and occupation of it (to be determined by the judgment of the court at the time of the foreclosure of the lien), and the mine on which the work is performed or for which the material is furnished is also subject to the lien created by AS 34.35.050 § 34.35.120 if, at the time the work is started or the materials for the building or other improvements are first furnished, the land belongs to the person who causes the building or other improvement to be constructed, altered, or repaired.

(b) If the person owns less than a fee simple estate in the land, then only the interest of the person in it is subject to the lien.

(c) If the interest is a leasehold interest, and the holder forfeits the rights of the holder to it, the purchaser of the building or improvement and leasehold term, or so much of it as remains unexpired at a sale under AS 34.35.050 §34.35.120 is considered to be the assignee of the leasehold term, and may pay the lessor all arrears of rent or other money and costs due under the lease.

(d) If the lessor regains possession of the land and property, or obtains judgment for the possession of it before the commencement of the construction, alteration, or repair of the building or other improvement, the purchaser may only remove the building or other improvement within 30 days after the purchase, and the owner of the land shall receive the rent due payable out of the proceeds of the sale, according to the terms of the lease, down to the time of the removal.

###### Sec. 34.35.060.   Priorities.

(a) Except as provided in (c) of this section, an encumbrance which is properly recorded shall be preferred to a lien created under AS 34.35.050 § 34.35.120 unless the claim of lien under AS 34.35.070 or notice of right to lien under AS 34.35.064 has been recorded before the encumbrance. The preference granted for a prior mortgage or deed of trust under this section applies without regard to when the sums are disbursed or whether the disbursements are required under the terms of a loan agreement.

(b)  [Repealed,§19 ch 175 SLA 1978.]

(c) A lien created by AS 34.35.050 § 34.35.120 in favor of an individual actually performing labor upon a building or other improvement in its original construction or of a trustee of an employee benefit trust for those individuals is preferred to a prior encumbrance upon the land on which the building or other improvement is constructed.

(d) In enforcing the lien, the building or other improvement may be sold separately from the land.  When sold separately, the purchaser may remove the building or other improvement within a reasonable time after the sale, not to exceed 30 days, upon the payment to the owner of the land of a reasonable rent for its use from the date of its purchase to the time of removal. If removal is prevented by legal proceedings, the 30 days does not begin to run until the final determination of the proceedings in the court of first resort, or in the appellate court if appeal is taken.

###### Sec. 34.35.062.   Construction financing.

(a) A claimant to whom payment for the labor, material, service, or equipment furnished for a project is past due may give the lender a stop-lending notice.

(6) state the amount due and unpaid to the claimant for the labor, material, service, or equipment.

(b) A stop-lending notice is binding upon a lender from the time the lender has received it and had a reasonable opportunity to act upon it until it expires or is revoked.  A notice expires on the 91st day after it is received by the lender unless the claimant has commenced an action on the claim that is the subject of the notice before that day and the lender has received written notification of the action.  A stop-lending notice may be revoked at any time in writing signed by the claimant.  Expiration or revocation of a notice extinguishes the liability of the lender to the claimant under (c) of this section.

(c) A lender who disburses, advances, or otherwise provides construction financing for a project after it is the subject of a stop-lending notice is liable to the claimant in an amount equal to the lowest of the following amounts:

(1) the amount of construction financing disbursed, advanced, or otherwise provided by the lender after receipt of the claimant's stop-lending notice; if there are two or more stop-lending notices when the disbursement occurs, the lender's liability to each claimant is based on the claimant's ranking under AS 34.35.112;

(2) the amount owed to the claimant, including interest, costs, and attorney's fees, for labor, material, service, or equipment furnished for the project by the claimant as established by a written agreement signed on or after the date of the stop-lending notice by the claimant, the owner and the prime contractor with whom or through whom the claimant or the claimant's debtor has contracted or by a final judgment in an action in which the owner, the claimant, and the claimant's debtor are named and, if necessary, served parties;

(3) 150 percent of the amount stated in the stop-lending notice.

(d) Within 10 days after receiving the written agreement or a certified copy of the judgment under (c)(2) of this section establishing the amount owed to a claimant from whom it has a binding stop-lending notice, a lender shall send to the claimant a verified statement showing, by date and amount, all construction financing provided by the lender for the project.  Except as provided in (e) of this section, the lender shall include with the statement payment in the amount of the lender's liability to the claimant under (c) of this section.

(e) If there are two or more claimants to whom a lender is or may be liable under (c) of this section and the lender is uncertain as to the amount of its liability or possible liability to each, the lender may bring an action to require the claimants to interplead their claims.

(f) A draw against construction financing may be made only after certification of job progress is delivered to the lender by the owner.  The form of the certification may be prescribed by the lender and must include

(1) a statement of the progress of the project, including the percentage of completion of the project;

(2) the name, address, and telephone number of each prime contractor who has furnished labor, material, service, or equipment for the project;

(3) the amount owed by the owner to each listed prime contractor; and

(4) the portion of the draw that the owner will pay to each listed prime contractor.

(g) The owner shall use each draw as indicated in the certificates given by the owner to the lender under (f) of this section. The lender may not be required to verify the information in a certificate and is not liable for an error in a certificate.

(h) An owner who intentionally fails to apply construction financing proceeds as indicated by the certificate required under (f) of this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor. The penalty provided under this subsection does not replace any other penalty that may be provided for by law for the same conduct.

(i) Within 10 days after being requested, a lender shall provide a person who has given the lender a stop-lending notice with a copy of

(1) each certificate received by the lender under (f) of this section; and

(2) a verified certificate stating the amount of construction financing proceeds committed by the lender for the project that have not been disbursed by the lender.

(j) The lender may not provide construction financing proceeds for payment of indebtedness of the owner that is not incurred for the project.

###### Sec. 34.35.064.   Notice of right to lien.

(a) Before furnishing labor, material, service, or equipment for a project, a person may give a notice of right to lien to the owner or owner's agent. If the notice is given in accordance with this section, the owner has the burden of proof to show that the owner did not know of or consent to the furnishing of the labor, material, service, or equipment by the claimant in an action to foreclose the claimant's lien on the property under AS 34.35.050§34.35.120.  Otherwise the claimant has the burden of proof to show that the owner knew of and consented to the furnishing of the labor, material, service, or equipment.

However, this section does not apply when the baggage or other property is not owned by the guest and the hotel or boardinghouse operator has actual notice of this fact.

###### Sec. 34.35.520.   Disposition of property to satisfy liens.

If the guest failed to register or to give sufficient address, the required notice shall be mailed to the guest at the city or town where the hotel or boardinghouse is located.  When the notice requirements of this section have been complied with, the sale of the baggage or other property is a perpetual bar to an action against the hotel or boardinghouse operator for recovery of baggage, property, or their value.

(b) After satisfaction of the lien and payment of all legal charges for storage and expenses incurred in selling the property, the remaining proceeds of the sale shall, within one year, be paid to the guest upon demand.

Except as provided under AS 34.35.117 and 34.35.119, an agreement by a person mentioned in AS 34.35.010 §34.35.425 to waive the right to acquire a lien provided in AS 34.35.010§ 34.35.425 is invalid.

###### Sec. 34.35.930.   Liberal construction of chapter.

## Chapter 40. Fraudulent Transfers, Revocations, and Trusts.

###### Sec. 34.40.010.   Invalidity generally.

Except as provided in AS 34.40.110, a conveyance or assignment, in writing or otherwise, of an estate or interest in land, or in goods, or things in action, or of rents or profits issuing from them or a charge upon land, goods, or things in action, or upon the rents or profits from them, made with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors or other persons of their lawful suits, damages, forfeitures, debts, or demands, or a bond or other evidence of debt given, action commenced, decree or judgment suffered, with the like intent, as against the persons so hindered, delayed, or defrauded is void.

###### Sec. 34.40.020.   Invalidity as against purchasers.

A conveyance of an interest in land, or the rents or profits of it, or a charge upon land or upon the rents and profits thereof, that is made or created with the intent to defraud prior or subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration of the land, rents, or profits, as against these purchasers, is void.

###### Sec. 34.40.030.   Purchasers with notice.

A conveyance or charge is not considered fraudulent in favor of a subsequent purchaser who has actual or legal notice of it at the time of the purchase, unless it appears that the grantee in the conveyance, or person to be benefited by the charge, was privy to the fraud intended.

###### Sec. 34.40.040.   Invalidating effect of provision for revocation, determination, or alteration.

A conveyance or charge of or upon an estate or interest in land containing a provision for the revocation, determination, or alteration of the estate or interest, or a part of it, at the will of the grantor, is void as against subsequent purchasers from the grantor for a valuable consideration of an estate or interest liable to be revoked or determined, although the estate or interest is not expressly revoked, determined, or altered by the grantor by virtue of the power reserved or expressed in a prior conveyance or charge.

###### Sec. 34.40.050.   Conveyance in exercise of power to revoke and reconvey.

Where a power to revoke a conveyance of land, or the rents and profits from it, and to reconvey the land or the rents and profits is given to a person other than the grantor in the conveyance, and the person subsequently conveys the land, rents, or profits to a purchaser for a valuable consideration, the subsequent conveyance is valid in the same manner and to the same extent as if the power of revocation were recited in it and the intent to revoke the former conveyance expressly declared.

###### Sec. 34.40.060.   Conveyance before accrual of right to execute power of revocation.

If a conveyance to a purchaser under either AS 34.40.040 or 34.40.050 is made before the person making the conveyance is entitled to execute the power of revocation, it nevertheless is valid from the time the power of revocation actually vests in the person, in the same manner and to the same extent as if then made.

###### Sec. 34.40.070.   Requirement of writing for grant or assignment of trust.

###### Sec. 34.40.090.   Fraudulent intent question of fact.

The question of fraudulent intent in a case arising under the provisions of this chapter is a question of fact, and not of law.

###### Sec. 34.40.100.   When title of purchaser for value not affected.

The provisions of AS 34.40.010 and 34.40.070 §34.40.130 may not be construed in any manner to affect or impair the title of a purchaser for a valuable consideration unless it appears that the purchaser had previous notice of the fraudulent intent of the purchaser's immediate grantor, or of the fraud rendering void the title of the grantor.

###### Sec. 34.40.110.   Restricting transfers of trust interests.

(a) A person who in writing transfers property in trust may provide that the interest of a beneficiary of the trust, including a beneficiary who is the settlor of the trust, may not be either voluntarily or involuntarily transferred before payment or delivery of the interest to the beneficiary by the trustee. Payment or delivery of the interest to the beneficiary does not include a beneficiary's use or occupancy of real property or tangible personal property owned by the trust if the use or occupancy is in accordance with the trustee's discretionary authority under the trust instrument. A provision in a trust instrument that provides the restrictions described in this subsection is considered to be a restriction that is a restriction on the transfer of the transferor's beneficial interest in the trust and that is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. 541(c)(2) (Bankruptcy Code), as that paragraph reads on September 15, 2004, or as it may be amended in the future. In this subsection,

(1) "property" includes real property, personal property, and interests in real or personal property;

(2) "transfer" means any form of transfer, including deed, conveyance, or assignment.

(b) If a trust contains a transfer restriction allowed under (a) of this section, the transfer restriction prevents a creditor existing when the trust is created or a person who subsequently becomes a creditor from satisfying a claim out of the beneficiary's interest in the trust, unless the creditor is a creditor of the settlor and

(1) the creditor establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the settlor's transfer of property in trust was made with the intent to defraud that creditor, and a cause of action or claim for relief with respect to the fraudulent transfer complies with the requirements of (d) of this section; however, a settlor's expressed intention to protect trust assets from a beneficiary's potential future creditors is not evidence of an intent to defraud;

(2) the trust, except for an eligible individual retirement account trust, provides that the settlor may revoke or terminate all or part of the trust without the consent of a person who has a substantial beneficial interest in the trust and the interest would be adversely affected by the exercise of the power held by the settlor to revoke or terminate all or part of the trust; in this paragraph, "revoke or terminate" does not include a power to veto a distribution from the trust, a testamentary or lifetime nongeneral power of appointment or similar power, or a right to receive a distribution of income or principal under (3)(A), (B), (C), or (D) of this subsection;

(3) the trust, except for an eligible individual retirement account trust, requires that all or a part of the trust's income or principal, or both, must be distributed to the settlor; however, this paragraph does not apply to a settlor's right to receive the following types of distributions, which remain subject to the restriction provided by (a) of this section until the distributions occur:

(A) income or principal from a charitable remainder annuity trust or charitable remainder unitrust; in this subparagraph, "charitable remainder annuity trust" and "charitable remainder unitrust" have the meanings given in 26 U.S.C. 664 (Internal Revenue Code) and as it may be amended;

(B) a percentage of the value of the trust each year as determined from time to time under the trust instrument, but not exceeding the amount that may be defined as income under AS 13.38 or under 26 U.S.C. 643(b) (Internal Revenue Code) and as it may be amended;

(C) the transferor's potential or actual use of real property held under a qualified personal residence trust within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. 2702(c) (Internal Revenue Code) or as it may be amended in the future; or

(D) income or principal from a grantor retained annuity trust or grantor retained unitrust that is allowed under 26 U.S.C. 2702 (Internal Revenue Code) or as it may be amended in the future; or

(4) at the time of the transfer, the settlor is in default by 30 or more days of making a payment due under a child support judgment or order.

(c) The satisfaction of a claim under (b)(1)§(4) of this section is limited to that part of the trust for which a transfer restriction is not allowed under (b)(1)§(4) of this section, and an attachment or other order may not be made against the trustee with respect to a beneficiary's interest in the trust or against property that is subject to a transfer restriction, except to the extent that a transfer restriction is determined not to be allowed under (b)(1)§(4) of this section.

(d) A cause of action or claim for relief with respect to a fraudulent transfer of a settlor's assets under (b)(1) of this section is extinguished unless the action under (b)(1) of this section is brought by a creditor of the settlor who

(1) is a creditor of the settlor before the settlor's assets are transferred to the trust, and the action under (b)(1) of this section is brought within the later of

(A) four years after the transfer is made; or

(B) one year after the transfer is or reasonably could have been discovered by the creditor if the creditor

(i) can demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the creditor asserted a specific claim against the settlor before the transfer; or

(ii) files another action, other than an action under (b)(1) of this section, against the settlor that asserts a claim based on an act or omission of the settlor that occurred before the transfer, and the action described in this sub-subparagraph is filed within four years after the transfer; or

(2) becomes a creditor subsequent to the transfer into trust, and the action under (b)(1) of this section is brought within four years after the transfer is made.

(e) If a trust contains a transfer restriction allowed under (a) of this section, the transfer restriction prevents a creditor existing when the trust is created, a person who subsequently becomes a creditor, or another person from asserting any cause of action or claim for relief against a trustee of the trust or against others involved in the preparation or funding of the trust for conspiracy to commit fraudulent conveyance, aiding and abetting a fraudulent conveyance, or participation in the trust transaction. Preparation or funding of the trust includes the preparation and funding of a limited partnership or a limited liability company if interests in the limited partnership or limited liability company are subsequently transferred to the trust. The creditor and other person prevented from asserting a cause of action or claim for relief are limited to recourse against the trust assets and the settlor to the extent allowed under AS 34.40.010.

(f) A transfer restriction allowed under (a) of this section and enforceable under (b) of this section applies to a settlor who is also a beneficiary of the trust even if the settlor serves as a co-trustee or as an advisor to the trustee under AS 13.36.375 if the settlor does not have a trustee power over discretionary distributions.

(g) A transfer restriction allowed under (a) of this section and enforceable under (b) of this section applies to a beneficiary who is not the settlor of the trust, whether or not the beneficiary serves as a sole trustee, a co-trustee, or an advisor to the trustee under AS 13.36.375.

(h) A transfer restriction is allowed under (a) of this section and is enforceable under (b) of this section even if the settlor has the authority under the terms of the trust instrument to

(1) appoint a trustee, a trust protector under AS 13.36.370, or an advisor under AS 13.36.375;

(2) remove a trustee or trust protector and appoint a replacement trustee or trust protector who is not a related or subordinate party; in this paragraph, "related or subordinate party" has the meaning given in 26 U.S.C. 672(c) (Internal Revenue Code); or

(3) remove an advisor and appoint a replacement advisor.

(i) A settlor whose beneficial interest in a trust is subject to a transfer restriction that is allowed under (a) of this section may not benefit from, direct a distribution of, or use trust property except as may be stated in the trust instrument. An agreement or understanding, express or implied, between the settlor and the trustee that attempts to grant or permit the retention of greater rights or authority than is stated in the trust instrument is void.

(j) A settlor who creates a trust that names the settlor as a beneficiary and whose beneficial interest is subject to a transfer restriction allowed under (a) of this section shall sign a sworn affidavit before the settlor transfers assets to the trust. The affidavit must state that

(1) the settlor has full right, title, and authority to transfer the assets to the trust;

(2) the transfer of the assets to the trust will not render the settlor insolvent;

(3) the settlor does not intend to defraud a creditor by transferring the assets to the trust;

(4) the settlor does not have any pending or threatened court actions against the settlor, except for those court actions identified by the settlor on an attachment to the affidavit;

(5) the settlor is not involved in any administrative proceedings, except for those administrative proceedings identified on an attachment to the affidavit;

(6) at the time of the transfer of the assets to the trust, the settlor is not currently in default of a child support obligation by more than 30 days;

(7) the settlor does not contemplate filing for relief under the provisions of 11 U.S.C. (Bankruptcy Code); and

(8) the assets being transferred to the trust were not derived from unlawful activities.

(k) Notwithstanding another provision of the law of this state, an action, including an action to enforce a judgment entered by a court or other body having adjudicative authority, may not be brought at law or in equity for an attachment or other provisional remedy against property of a trust subject to this section or to avoid a transfer of property to a trust that is the subject of this section unless the action is brought under (b)(1) of this section and within the limitations period of (d) of this section. A court of this state has exclusive jurisdiction over an action brought under a cause of action or claim for relief that is based on a transfer of property to a trust that is the subject of this section.

(l) If a trust has a transfer restriction allowed under (a) of this section, in the event of the divorce or dissolution of the marriage of a beneficiary of the trust, the beneficiary's interest in the trust is not considered property subject to division under AS 25.24.160 or 25.24.230 or a part of a property division under AS 25.24.160 or 25.24.230. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties to the marriage, this subsection does not apply to a settlor's interest in a self-settled trust with respect to assets transferred to the trust

(1) after the settlor's marriage; or

(2) within 30 days before the settlor's marriage unless the settlor gives written notice to the other party to the marriage of the transfer.

(m) If a trust contains a transfer restriction allowed under (a) of this section, the transfer restriction prevents a creditor existing when the trust is created or a person who subsequently becomes a creditor from satisfying a claim out of the interest of a beneficiary, including a beneficiary who is the settlor of the trust, even if

(1) the beneficiary has the right to receive through the exercise of a person's discretion, whether or not the exercise of the discretion is governed by a standard, a distribution of income, principal, or both principal and interest, from the trust; in this paragraph, "person" includes a trustee who is the settlor, unless the settlor is the beneficiary; or

(2) the settlor potentially will receive or actually receives income or principal to pay, in whole or in part, income taxes due on the income of the trust, if the potential or actual receipt of income or principal will be or is made under a provision in the trust instrument that expressly provides for the payment of the taxes and if the potential or actual receipt of income or principal would be the result of a trustee's acting in the trustee's discretion or under a mandatory direction in the trust instrument; a distribution to pay income taxes that is made under a discretionary or mandatory provision in a governing instrument under this paragraph may be made by direct payment to a taxing authority.

(n) In this section,

(1) "eligible individual retirement account trust" means an individual retirement account under 26 U.S.C. 408(a) or an individual retirement plan under 26 U.S.C. 408A(b) (Internal Revenue Code), as those sections read on September 13, 2006 or as they may be amended in the future, that is in the form of a trust, if a trust company or bank with its principal place of business in this state is the trustee or custodian;

(2) "settlor" means a person who transfers real property, personal property, or an interest in real or personal property, in trust.

###### Sec. 34.40.113.   Discretionary interests in irrevocable trusts.

(a) This section applies to a creditor's claim with respect to a discretionary interest in an irrevocable trust unless the trust instrument provides otherwise.

(b) A discretionary interest in an irrevocable trust is not a property interest or an enforceable right. It is an expectancy that a creditor of a beneficiary may not attach or otherwise reach.

(c) A creditor of a beneficiary may not force a distribution with regard to a discretionary interest in an irrevocable trust. A creditor may not compel a trustee to exercise the trustee's discretion to make a distribution with regard to a discretionary interest in an irrevocable trust.

(d) Even if a beneficiary has an outstanding creditor, in the case of a discretionary interest in an irrevocable trust, a trustee who has the authority to pay income or principal to a beneficiary may pay it to a third party if the payment is for the benefit of the beneficiary.

The cost of an examination made under (c) of this section may be assessed only against the business association.

(f) If a holder does not maintain the records required by AS 34.45.300 and the records of the holder available for the periods subject to AS 34.45.110§34.45.780 are insufficient to permit the preparation of a report, the department may require the holder to report and pay to the department the amount the department reasonably estimates, on the basis of any available records of the holder or by any other reasonable method of estimation, should have been but was not reported.

If payment or delivery is postponed, the property paid or delivered to the administrator must include all interest, dividends, increments, and accretions due, payable, or distributable on the day that the property is paid or delivered to the administrator.

(b) If the owner establishes the right to receive the abandoned property to the satisfaction of the holder before the property has been delivered or if it appears that the presumption of abandonment is erroneous, the holder need not pay or deliver the property to the department, and the property is no longer presumed abandoned. The holder shall file with the department a written explanation, made under penalty of unsworn falsification in the second degree, of the proof of claim or of the error in the presumption of abandonment.

###### Sec. 34.45.330.   Custody by state.

(a) Upon the payment or delivery of property to the department, the state assumes custody and responsibility for the safekeeping of the property.  A person who pays or delivers property to the department in good faith is relieved of all liability to the extent of the value of the property paid or delivered for a claim existing at the time of the payment or delivery or that may arise or be made with respect to the property after the payment or delivery.

(b) A holder who has paid money to the department under AS 34.45.110§34.45.430 may make payment to a person appearing to the holder to be entitled to payment.  Upon receiving proof of payment from the holder and proof that the payee was entitled to the payment, the department shall promptly reimburse the holder for the payment without imposing a fee or other charge.  If reimbursement is sought for a payment made on a negotiable instrument, including a traveler's check or money order, the department shall reimburse the holder under this subsection when the holder files proof that the instrument was presented and that payment was made to a person who appeared to the holder to be entitled to payment.  The department shall reimburse the holder for payment made under this subsection even if the holder paid a person whose claim was barred under AS 34.45.430.

(c) A holder who has delivered property other than money to the department under AS 34.45.110§34.45.430 may reclaim the property if it is still in the possession of the department, without payment of a fee or other charge, upon filing proof that the owner has claimed the property from the holder.

(f) Property removed from a safe deposit box or other safekeeping repository is received by the department subject to the holder's right under this subsection to be reimbursed for the actual cost of the opening and to a valid lien or contract providing for the holder to be reimbursed for unpaid rent or storage charges.  For charges other than the actual cost of the opening, the department shall reimburse or pay the holder an amount no greater than the value of the property recovered less the department's selling cost.

(g) For the purposes of this section, "good faith" means that

(1) payment or delivery was made in a reasonable attempt to comply with this chapter;

(2) the person delivering the property was not a fiduciary then in breach of trust in respect to the property, and had a reasonable basis for believing, based on the facts then known to the person, that the property was abandoned for the purposes of this chapter; and

(3) there is no showing that the records under which the delivery was made did not meet reasonable commercial standards of practice in the industry.

The department may decline the highest bid and reoffer the property for sale if in the judgment of the department the bid is insufficient.  If in the judgment of the department the probable cost of sale exceeds the value of the property, the department need not offer the property for sale.  A sale held under this section must be preceded by a single publication of notice, at least three weeks in advance of sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the general area in which the property is to be sold.

(b) Securities listed on an established stock exchange must be sold at prices prevailing at the time of sale on the exchange.  Other securities may be sold over the counter at prices prevailing at the time of sale or by another method the department considers advisable.

(d) Unless the department considers it to be in the best interest of the state to do otherwise, the department shall hold all securities presumed abandoned under AS 34.45.200 and delivered to the department for at least three years before selling the securities.  A person making a claim under AS 34.45.380 is entitled to receive either the securities delivered to the department by the holder, if they still remain in the hands of the department, or the proceeds received from sale, less amounts deducted under AS 34.45.380(c).  A person does not have a claim under this section or AS 34.45.380 against the state, the holder, a transfer agent, a registrar, or other person acting for or on behalf of a holder for appreciation in the value of the property occurring after delivery by the holder to the department.

The notice may be given by mailing it to the address, if any, stated in the claim as the address to which notices are to be sent.  If an address for notices is not stated in the claim, the notice may be mailed to the address, if any, of the claimant as stated in the claim.  A notice of denial need not be given if the claim states neither the address to which notices are to be sent nor the address of the claimant.

(c) If a claim is allowed, the department shall pay or deliver to the claimant the property or the amount the department actually received, or the net proceeds if it has been sold by the department, together with an additional amount required by AS 34.45.340.

Interest begins to accrue when the property is delivered to the department and ceases on the expiration of 10 years after delivery or the date on which payment is made to the owner, whichever is earlier.  The department may not pay interest on interest-bearing property for a period occurring before September 7, 1986.

(e) A holder who pays the owner for property that has been delivered to the state and that, if claimed from the department, would be subject to (d) of this section shall add interest as provided in (d) of this section.  The added interest shall be repaid to the holder by the commissioner in the same manner as the principal.

(4) this state took custody of the property under AS 34.45.120(6), and, under the laws of the state of domicile of the holder, the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by the state of domicile; or

(5) the property is the sum payable on a traveler's check, money order, or other similar instrument of which this state took custody under AS 34.45.140, and the instrument was purchased in the other state, and, under the laws of the other state, the property escheated to or became subject to a claim of abandonment by the other state.

(b) The claim of another state to recover escheated or abandoned property must be presented in a form prescribed by the department.  The department shall allow the claim if it determines that the other state is entitled to the abandoned property under (a) of this section.

###### Sec. 34.60.120.   Uniform real property acquisition policy.

A state agency or other entity acquiring real property for any project or program in which federal or federal-aid funds are used shall to the greatest extent practicable comply with the following policies:

(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to expeditiously acquire real property by negotiation.

(2) Real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, and the owner or a designated representative shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during the inspection of the property.

(3) Before the initiation of negotiations for real property, an amount shall be established that is reasonably believed to be just compensation for the real property and that amount shall be offered for the property. In no event may the amount be less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property.  A decrease or increase in the fair market value of real property before the date of valuation caused by the public improvement for which the property is acquired or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for the improvement, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, will be disregarded in determining the compensation for the property. The owner of the real property to be acquired shall be provided with a written statement of, and a summary of the basis for, the amount established as just compensation.

(4) An owner may not be required to surrender possession of real property before the state agency concerned pays the agreed purchase price or deposits with the court in accordance with applicable law, for the benefit of the owner, an amount not less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property, or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for the property.

(5) The construction or development of a public improvement shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practicable, a person lawfully occupying real property is not required to move from a dwelling, assuming a replacement dwelling will be available, or to move the person's business or farm operation, without at least 90 days' written notice of the date by which the move is required.

(6) If an owner or tenant is permitted to occupy the real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term or for a period subject to termination by the state agency on short notice, the amount of rent required may not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier.

(7) In no event may the time of condemnation be advanced or negotiations or condemnation and the deposit of funds in court for the use of the owner be deferred, nor any other coercive action be taken in order to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the property.

(8) If an interest in real property is to be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain, formal condemnation proceedings shall be instituted.  The acquiring state agency may not intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of the real property.

(9) If the acquisition of only part of the property would leave its owner with an uneconomic remnant, an offer to acquire the entire property shall be made.

###### Sec. 34.60.130.   Uniform acquisition policy for improvements.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a state agency acquires any interest in real property, the state agency must acquire at least an equal interest in all buildings, structures, or other improvements located upon the real property which the state agency requires to be removed from the real property or which the state agency determines will be adversely affected by the use to which the real property will be put.

(b) For the purpose of determining just compensation to be paid for a building, structure, or other improvement required to be acquired under (a) of this section, the building, structure, or other improvement is considered to be a part of the real property to be acquired notwithstanding the right or obligation of a tenant, as against the owner of any other interest in the real property, to remove the building, structure, or improvement at the expiration of the tenant's term, and the fair market value which the building, structure, or improvement contributes to the fair market value of the real property to be acquired, or the fair market value of the building, structure, or improvement for removal from the real property, whichever is the greater, shall be paid to the tenant.

(c) Payment for the buildings, structures, or improvements under this section may not result in duplication of payments otherwise authorized by law.  A payment for buildings, structures, or improvements may not be made unless the owner of the land involved disclaims all interest in the improvements of the tenant.  In consideration for any such payment, the tenant shall assign, transfer, and release to the state agency all right, title, and interest in and to the improvements.  Nothing in this subsection and in (b) of this section deprives the tenant of any rights to reject payment and to obtain payment for the property interests in accordance with other laws of the state.

###### Sec. 34.60.135.   Planning loans for additional housing.

In addition to the other programs authorized by this chapter, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation may make loans in order to encourage and facilitate the construction or rehabilitation of housing to meet the needs of displaced persons. These loans are a part of the federally assisted project cost and may be made to nonprofit, limited dividend, or cooperative organizations, or to public bodies. The loans may be made only for necessary and reasonable expenses, before construction, for planning and obtaining federally insured mortgage financing for the rehabilitation or construction of housing for displaced persons.

Reasonable costs include but are not limited to costs for preliminary surveys and analysis of market needs, preliminary architectural fees, site acquisition, application and mortgage commitment fees, and construction loan fees and discounts. Loans to an organization established for profit shall bear interest at a market rate established by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation. All other loans shall be without interest. The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation shall require repayment of loans made under this section under terms and conditions that it may prescribe. Repayment shall be made upon completion of the project or sooner, and except in the case of a loan to an organization established for profit, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation may cancel any part or all of a loan if the corporation determines that a permanent loan to finance the rehabilitation or construction of the housing cannot be obtained in an amount adequate for repayment of the loan.

(g) A writing that is signed by a creditor and that reduces a creditor's rights under this section is binding on the creditor.

(h) A provision of a community property agreement or a community property trust does not adversely affect the interest of a creditor unless the creditor has actual knowledge of the provision when the obligation to the creditor is incurred. The effect of this subsection may not be varied by a community property agreement or a community property trust.

###### Sec. 34.77.080.   Protection of bona fide purchasers dealing with spouses.

(b) Community property purchased by a bona fide purchaser from a spouse having the right to manage and control the property under AS 34.77.040 is acquired free of any claim of the other spouse.

###### Sec. 34.77.090.   Community property agreement.

(a) A community property agreement must be contained in a written document signed by both spouses and classify some or all of the property of the spouses as community property. It is enforceable without consideration.

(b) A community property agreement must contain the following language in capital letters at the beginning of the agreement:

THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE VERY EXTENSIVE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CREDITORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, AND YOUR RIGHTS WITH YOUR SPOUSE BOTH DURING THE COURSE OF YOUR MARRIAGE AND AT THE TIME OF A DIVORCE. ACCORDINGLY, THIS AGREEMENT SHOULD ONLY BE SIGNED AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT, YOU SHOULD SEEK COMPETENT ADVICE.  (c) A community property agreement may not adversely affect the right of a child to support.

(d) Except as provided in AS 34.77.020, 34.77.070(h), 34.77.080(b), and in (c) of this section, in a community property agreement, spouses may agree

(1) on the rights and obligations in the property, notwithstanding when and where the property is acquired and located;

(2) on the management and control of their property;

(3) on the disposition of their property on dissolution, death, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of another event;

(4) on making a will, trust, or other arrangement to carry out the agreement;

(5) that, upon the death of either of them, any of their property, including after-acquired property, passes without probate to a designated person, trust, or other entity by nontestamentary disposition;

(6) on the choice of law governing the interpretation of the agreement; and

(7) on any other matter that affects their property and does not violate public policy or a statute imposing a criminal penalty.

(e) A community property agreement may not be amended or revoked unless the agreement itself provides for amendment or revocation, or unless the agreement is amended or revoked by a later community property agreement. To amend or revoke the agreement, the later community property agreement is not required to declare any property of the spouses as community property. The amended agreement or the revocation is enforceable without consideration. However, notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, unless the community property agreement expressly provides otherwise, if a community property agreement provides for the nontestamentary disposition of property without probate, at any time after the death of the first spouse the surviving spouse may amend the community property agreement with regard to the surviving spouse's property to be disposed of at the surviving spouse's death. In this subsection, "surviving spouse's property" means the property that consists of the surviving spouse's separate property and the surviving spouse's share of the community property determined as of the date of the first spouse's death.

(f) Persons intending to marry each other may enter into a community property agreement as if married, but the agreement does not become effective until the persons are married.

(g) A community property agreement executed during marriage is not enforceable if the spouse against whom enforcement is sought proves that

(1) the agreement was unconscionable when made;

(3) before execution of the agreement, the spouse against whom enforcement is sought

(A) was not given a fair and reasonable disclosure of the property and financial obligations of the other spouse;

(A) was not given a fair and reasonable disclosure of the property and financial obligations of the other spouse;

(B) did not voluntarily sign a written consent expressly waiving the right to disclosure of the property and financial obligations of the other spouse beyond the disclosure provided; and

(i) Whether or not a community property agreement is unconscionable is determined by a court as a matter of law.

###### Sec. 34.77.100.   Community property trust.

(a) An arrangement is a community property trust if one or both spouses transfer property to a trust, the trust expressly declares that some or all the property transferred is community property under this chapter, and at least one trustee is a qualified person whose powers include or are limited to maintaining records for the trust on an exclusive or a nonexclusive basis and preparing or arranging for the preparation of, on an exclusive or a nonexclusive basis, any income tax returns that must be filed by the trust. A community property trust is enforceable without consideration. Both spouses or either spouse may be a trustee. The trust must be signed by both spouses. In this subsection, "qualified person" means

(1) an individual

(A) who, except for brief intervals, military service, attendance at an educational or training institution, or absences for good cause shown, resides in this state;

(b) A community property trust must contain the following language in capital letters at the beginning of the trust:

THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS TRUST MAY BE VERY EXTENSIVE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CREDITORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, AND YOUR RIGHTS WITH YOUR SPOUSE BOTH DURING THE COURSE OF YOUR MARRIAGE AND AT THE TIME OF A DIVORCE. ACCORDINGLY, THIS AGREEMENT SHOULD ONLY BE SIGNED AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT, YOU SHOULD SEEK COMPETENT ADVICE.  (c) A community property trust may not adversely affect the right of a child to support.

(d) Except as provided in AS 34.77.010, 34.77.070(h), 34.77.080(b), and in (c) of this section, in a community property trust spouses may agree on

(1) the rights and obligations in the property transferred to the trust, notwithstanding when and where the property is acquired or located;

(2) the management and control of the property transferred to the trust;

(3) the disposition of the property transferred to the trust on dissolution, death, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of another event;

(4) the choice of law governing the interpretation of the trust; and

(5) any other matter that affects the property transferred to the trust and does not violate public policy or a statute imposing a criminal penalty.

(e) A community property trust may not be amended or revoked unless the agreement itself provides for amendment or revocation, or unless the agreement is amended or revoked by a later community property trust. To amend or revoke the trust, the later community property trust is not required to declare any property held by the trustee as community property. The amended trust or the revocation is enforceable without consideration. However, notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, unless the community property trust expressly provides otherwise, at any time after the death of the first spouse the surviving spouse may amend the community property trust with regard to the surviving spouse's property to be disposed of at the surviving spouse's death. In this subsection, "surviving spouse's property" means the property that consists of the surviving spouse's separate property and the surviving spouse's share of the community property determined as of the date of the first spouse's death.

(f) A community property trust executed during marriage is not enforceable if the spouse against whom enforcement is sought proves that

(1) trust was unconscionable when made; or

(2) the spouse against whom enforcement is sought did not execute the community property trust agreement voluntarily; or

(3) before execution of the community property trust agreement, the spouse against whom enforcement is sought

(A) was not given a fair and reasonable disclosure of the property and financial obligations of the other spouse;

(B) did not voluntarily sign a written waiver expressly waiving right to disclosure of the property and financial obligations of the other spouse beyond the disclosure provided; and

(C) did not have notice of the property or financial obligations of the other spouse.

(g) Whether or not a community property trust is unconscionable is determined by a court as a matter of law.

(h) The trustee of a community property trust shall maintain records that identify which property held by the trust is community property and which property held by the trust is not community property.

(i) In addition to other transfers of property to a community property trust, property will be considered transferred to a community property trust if the property is subject to a nonprobate transfer on death under AS 13.33.101 and the community property trust is designated as the beneficiary to receive the property under the transfer.

###### Sec. 34.77.110.   Forms of holding property.

(a) Spouses may hold community property in a form that designates the holders of it by the words "(name of one spouse) or (name of other spouse) as community property." Community property held in this form is subject to AS 34.77.040(a)(6).

(b) Spouses may hold community property in a form that designates the holder of it by the words "(name of one spouse) and (name of other spouse) as community property." Community property held in this form is subject to AS 34.77.040(b).

(c) A spouse may hold individual property in a form that designates the holder of it by the words "(name of spouse) as individual property." Individual property held in this form is subject to AS 34.77.040(a)(1).

(d) [Repealed,§46 ch 45 SLA 2013.]

(e) If the words "survivorship community property" are used instead of the words "community property" in the form described in (a) or (b) of this section, the community property is survivorship community property. On the death of a spouse, the ownership rights of that spouse in survivorship community property vest solely in the surviving spouse by nontestamentary disposition at death. The first deceased spouse does not have a right of disposition at death of any interest in survivorship community property. Holding community property in a form described in (a) or (b) of this section does not by itself establish survivorship ownership between the spouses for the property held in that form.

(f) Property that spouses agree in a community property agreement is community property or property that is transferred to a community property trust and expressly declared by the trust to be community property is owned as community property regardless of the form of title to the property, even if the title indicates that the property is owned unequally by the spouses or is only in the name of one spouse.

(g) If the title to community property is in a form that provides for ownership by survivorship between the spouses, then ownership by survivorship is presumed to have been made with the consent of both spouses.

(h) If a spouse with management and control of community property designates a beneficiary for the property on the death of one or both of the spouses, and if the community property is held in a form of title that permits a beneficiary designation, the beneficiary designation is effective only for the designating spouse's one-half interest in the community property unless the other spouse consents in writing to the designation. A designation of the following as the beneficiary is presumed to have been made with the consent of the other spouse:

(1) the other spouse or an ancestor or descendant of either spouse;

(2) a charity; or

(3) a trust, to the extent that the beneficiaries consist of persons or entities identified in (1) or (2) of this subsection.

(i) The testimony of one spouse is sufficient to rebut a presumption established under this section.

(j) A disposition of community property contrary to (e)§(h) of this section is voidable. An action in court to void the disposition must be commenced within the time specified by AS 34.77.140(e).

###### Sec. 34.77.120.   Classification of life insurance policies and proceeds.

(a) If a policy issuer makes payments or takes actions in accordance with the policy and the issuer's records, the issuer is not liable because of the payments or actions unless, at the time of the payments or actions, the issuer had actual knowledge of inconsistent provisions of a community property agreement, a community property trust, a decree relating to a community property agreement or a community property trust, or an adverse claim that is brought by a spouse, former spouse, surviving spouse, or persons claiming under a deceased spouse's disposition at death and that relates to a community property agreement or a community property trust.

(b) Except as provided in (c)§(e) of this section,

(1) the ownership interest in and proceeds of a policy that insures the life of one of the spouses and that has been classified by a community property agreement or a community property trust as community property are community property without regard to the classification of property used to pay premiums on the policy;

(2) the ownership interest in and proceeds of a policy that is owned by one spouse and that has not been classified by a community property agreement or a community property trust as community property are mixed property if all or part of a premium on the policy is paid from community property after the determination date; the community property component of the ownership interest and proceeds is the part resulting from multiplying the entire ownership interest and proceeds by a fraction that consists of a numerator that is the sum of the net premiums and portions of net premiums paid from community property and a denominator that is the sum of the net premiums paid;

(3) the ownership interest in and proceeds of a policy issued during marriage that designates the spouse of the insured as the owner are the individual property of the owner without regard to the classification of property used to pay premiums on the policy;

(4) the ownership interest in and proceeds of a policy that designates a person other than either of the spouses as the owner are not affected by this chapter if a premium on the policy is not paid from community property after the determination date; if all or part of a premium on the policy is paid from community property after the determination date, the ownership interest and proceeds of the policy are in part property of the designated owner of the policy and in part community property of the spouses without regard to the classification of property used to pay premiums on the policy after the initial payment of a premium on the policy from community property; the community property component of the ownership interest and proceeds is the part resulting from multiplying the entire ownership interest and proceeds by a fraction that consists of a numerator that is the sum of the net premiums and portions of net premiums paid from community property and a denominator that is the sum of the net premiums paid;

(5) written consent by a spouse to the designation of another person as the beneficiary of the proceeds of a policy is effective to relinquish that spouse's interest in the ownership interest and proceeds of the policy without regard to the classification of property used by a spouse or another person to pay premiums on the policy; a designation of any of the following persons or trusts as the beneficiary of a policy is presumed to have been made with the consent of the other spouse:

(A) the other spouse or an ancestor or descendant of either spouse; or

(B) a trust, to the extent that its beneficiaries consist of one or more of the persons named in (A) of this paragraph;

(6) unless the spouses provide otherwise in a community property agreement or community property trust, designation of a trust as the beneficiary of the proceeds of a policy with a community property component does not reclassify the component;

(7) unless the spouses provide otherwise, if an irrevocable trust owns a life insurance policy insuring the life of one spouse and the spouse whose life is not insured by the policy is provided a beneficial interest in the trust, then, before a contribution of assets to the trust, the spouse whose life is not insured by the policy is presumed to have relinquished any community property interest that the spouse whose life is not insured by the policy may have had in the assets contributed to the trust; the presumption in this paragraph applies only to the extent that the beneficiaries of the trust consist of one or more of the following persons:

(A) the spouse whose life is not insured;

(B) an ancestor of either spouse;

(C) a descendant of either spouse;

(8) the testimony of the spouse whose life is not insured is sufficient to rebut a presumption in (5) or (7) of this subsection.

(c) This section does not affect a creditor's interest in the ownership interest or proceeds of a policy assigned or made payable to the creditor as security.

(d) The interest of a person as owner or beneficiary of a policy acquired under a decree or property settlement agreement incident to a prior marriage or parenthood is not community property notwithstanding the classification of property used to pay premiums on the policy.

(e) This section does not affect the ownership interest or proceeds of a policy unless a spouse or a trust described in (b)(7) of this section is designated as an owner in the policy or on the records of the policy issuer and community property is used to pay a premium on the policy.

(f) In this section,

(1) "owner" means a person appearing on the records of a policy issuer as the person having the ownership interest, or, if a person other than the insured does not appear on the records as a person having the interest, "owner" means the insured;

(2) "ownership interest" means the rights of an owner under a policy;

(3) "policy" means an insurance policy insuring the life of a spouse and providing for payment of death benefits at the spouse's death;

(4) "proceeds" means the death benefit from a policy and all other economic benefits from the policy, whether the economic benefits accrue or become payable as a result of the death of an insured person or upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of another event.

###### Sec. 34.77.130.   Mixed property.

(a) Except as provided otherwise in AS 34.77.110, mixing community property with property having another classification reclassifies the other property as community property unless the component of the mixed property that is not community property can be traced.

(b) If a community property agreement provides that all property acquired by either or both spouses during marriage is community property, application by one spouse of substantial labor, effort, inventiveness, physical skill, intellectual skill, creativity, or managerial activity on individual property of the other spouse creates community property attributable to the application if

(1) reasonable compensation is not received for the application; and

(2) substantial appreciation of the individual property of the other spouse results from the application.

###### Sec. 34.77.140.   Interspousal remedies.

(a) A spouse has a claim against the other spouse for breach of the good faith requirement under AS 34.77.010 resulting in damage to the claimant spouse's present undivided one-half interest in community property.

(b) If the spouses have signed a community property agreement or a community property trust, a court may order an accounting of the property and obligations of the spouses and may determine rights of ownership in, beneficial enjoyment of, or access to marital property and the classification of all property of the spouses.

(c) A court may order that the name of a spouse be added to community property held in the name of the other spouse alone, except

(1) a partnership interest held by the other spouse as a general partner;

(2) an interest in a professional corporation, professional association, or similar entity held by the other spouse as a stockholder or member;

(3) an asset of an unincorporated business if the other spouse is the only spouse involved in operating or managing the business; or

(4) other property if the addition would adversely affect the rights of a third person.

(d) Except as provided otherwise in (e)§(h) of this section, a spouse must begin an action against the other spouse under (a) of this section within three years after acquiring actual knowledge of the facts giving rise to the claim.

(e) Except as provided by (f)§(h) of this section, if a gift of community property during marriage by a spouse does not comply with AS 34.77.050(a), the nondonor spouse may bring an action to recover the property or the amount of money by which the gift exceeded the limit under AS 34.77.050(a). The nondonor spouse may bring the action against the donor spouse, the gift recipient, or both. The nondonor spouse must commence the action within the earliest of the following times:

(1) one year after the nondonor spouse receives notice of the gift;

(2) one year after dissolution of the marriage; or

(3) on or before the deadline for filing a claim under AS 13.16.460 after the death of the donor spouse.

(f) If a recovery under (e) of this section occurs during the marriage of the donor spouse and the nondonor spouse, the property or money that is recovered is considered community property. If the recovery occurs after the dissolution of the marriage of the donor and nondonor spouses or after the death of either the donor or the nondonor spouse, the recovery is limited to 50 percent of the property or money that would have been recovered if the recovery had occurred during the marriage.

(g) If a transfer of community property to a third person during marriage by a spouse acting without the other spouse becomes a completed gift on the death of the donor spouse, or if an arrangement involving community property during marriage by a spouse acting without the other spouse is intended to be and becomes a gift to a third person on the death of the donor spouse, the surviving spouse may bring an action in court against the gift recipient to recover one-half of the gift. To bring an action under this subsection, the surviving spouse must commence the action on or before the deadline for filing a claim under AS 13.16.460.

(h) If a spouse who would have been entitled to bring an action under (e)§(g) of this section predeceases the donor spouse, the deceased spouse's successor in interest may bring an action for recovery under (e)§(g) of this section, but the action must be commenced within one year after the deceased spouse's death. Recovery in an action under this subsection is the same as if the donor spouse had predeceased the spouse entitled to the recovery, but the amount of the recovery is calculated as of the date of the death of the spouse entitled to the recovery.

###### Sec. 34.77.150.   Treatment of certain property at death of spouse.

If a community property agreement provides that all property acquired by either or both spouses during marriage is community property, at the death of a spouse domiciled in this state, property of the spouse that can be traced to property received by the spouse after the determination date as a recovery for a loss of earning capacity during marriage shall be treated as if it were community property.

###### Sec. 34.77.155.   Division of community property at death.

(a) Upon the death of a spouse, one-half of the aggregate value of the community property owned by the spouses and by any community property trust established by the spouses reflects the share of the surviving spouse and the other one-half reflects the share of the decedent.

(b) Upon the death of a spouse, the deceased spouse's personal representative and the trustee of a community property trust each have the power to distribute community property in divided or undivided interests and to adjust resulting differences in valuation. A distribution of community property in kind may be made on the basis of a non pro rata division of the aggregate value of the community property, on the basis of a pro rata division of each individual item or asset of community property, or by using both methods.

(c) Notwithstanding (a) and (b) of this section, spouses may agree in writing to divide their community property on the basis of a non pro rata division of the aggregate value of the community property or on the basis of a pro rata division of each individual item or asset of community property, or by using both methods.
