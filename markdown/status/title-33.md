(a) A probation officer shall

(1) furnish to each probationer under the supervision of the officer a written statement of the conditions of probation and shall instruct the probationer regarding the same;

When directed by the court, the probation officer shall report to the court with a statement of the conduct of the probationer while on probation.

###### Sec. 33.05.060.   Transfer of jurisdiction over probationer.

Whenever during the period of probation, a probationer goes from the judicial district in which the probationer is being supervised to another judicial district, jurisdiction over the probationer may be transferred, in the discretion of the court, from the court for the district from which the probationer goes to the court for the other district, with the concurrence of the latter court.  Thereupon the court for the district to which jurisdiction is transferred shall have all power with respect to the probationer that was previously possessed by the court for the district from which the transfer is made, except that the period of probation may not be changed without the consent of the sentencing court.  This process under the same conditions may be repeated whenever during the period of probation the probationer goes from the district in which the probationer is being supervised to another district.

At any time within the probation period, or within the maximum probation period permitted by AS 12.55.080 and 12.55.090, the court for the district in which the probationer is being supervised or, if the probationer is no longer under supervision, the court for the district in which the probationer was last under supervision may issue a warrant for the probationer's arrest for violation of probation occurring during the probation period.  The warrant may be executed in any district by the probation officer or any peace officer in the district in which the warrant was issued or of any district in which the probationer is found.  If the probationer is arrested in any district other than that in which the probationer was last supervised, the probationer shall be returned to the district in which the warrant was issued, unless jurisdiction over the probationer is transferred as above provided to the district in which the probationer is found, and in that case the probationer shall be detained pending further proceedings in that district.

(b) As speedily as possible after arrest, the probationer shall be taken before the court for the district having jurisdiction over the probationer. Except as provided in AS 12.55.090(f), the court may revoke the probation and require the probationer to serve the sentence imposed or any lesser sentence and, if imposition of sentence was suspended, may impose any sentence that might originally have been imposed, subject to the limitation specified in AS 12.55.086(c).

(c) At any time within the probation period, a police officer certified by the Alaska Police Standards Council may detain a probationer if the police officer has reasonable suspicion that the probationer has recently violated or may imminently violate a probation condition relating to one of the topics set out in (d) of this section. The police officer may also arrest the probationer without a warrant if the police officer has probable cause to believe that the probationer has violated a probation condition relating to one of the topics set out in (d) of this section.

(d) The conditions that permit a police officer to detain or arrest a probationer or parolee without a warrant under AS 33.16.240 and (c) of this section are those conditions imposed by the court, or the parole board, relating to

(2) the defendant has been charged with

(A) an offense under AS 28.35.030 or 28.35.032, and the offender has been assessed as high risk under a pretrial risk assessment;

(B) an offense under AS 11.56.730 or 11.56.757, and the offender has been assessed as low to moderate risk under a pretrial risk assessment; or

(C) any other offense, and the defendant has been assessed as being low risk under a pretrial risk assessment.

(e) A pretrial services officer may recommend release on personal recognizance, upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond, or upon execution of an unsecured performance bond, with nonmonetary conditions as appropriate, for a defendant not otherwise recommended for release under (c) or (d) of this section.

(f) A pretrial services officer may supervise a defendant released while awaiting trial, imposing the least restrictive level of supervision that will reasonably ensure the appearance of the person in court and the safety of the victim, other persons, and the community, and prioritizing higher levels of supervision for a defendant accused of serious charges or assessed as moderate or high risk under a pretrial risk assessment. The commissioner may, in accordance with AS 36.30, procure and enter into agreements or contracts for the supervision of defendants on electronic monitoring during the pretrial period.

(g) A pretrial services officer may

(1) recommend pretrial diversion to the court and parties before adjudication in accordance with the guidelines established by the commissioner under AS 33.07.020(6);

(2) if the officer has probable cause to believe the defendant has committed an offense under AS 11.56.730 or 11.56.757 or has violated the defendant's release conditions, file a complaint with the court and

(1) in order to gain meaningful access to a court for the purpose of challenging

(A) the prisoner's conviction or sentence; or

(B) the conditions of the prisoner's confinement; or

(a) Each prisoner who is productively employed, as defined in AS 33.30.191(g)(1) or (3)§(5), may receive for that work compensation at a rate determined by the commissioner under this section if the money is available from legislative appropriations. Compensation established by the commissioner under this section may not exceed 50 percent of the minimum wage established in AS 23.10.065; however, if required to comply with a federal statute or regulation, a higher compensation may be established by the commissioner.

(b) If compensation established under (a) of this section is 50 percent or more of the minimum wage established in AS 23.10.065, the commissioner may deduct the cost of confinement of the prisoner up to the statewide average cost of confinement before disbursements are made under (c) of this section.

(c) The commissioner shall disburse compensation received under (a) of this section, after any deduction required by (b) of this section, in the following order of priority:

(1) for support of the prisoner's dependents, if any;

(3) to pay a civil judgment resulting from the prisoner's criminal conduct;

(4) to pay a restitution or fine of the prisoner ordered by a sentencing court;

(5) for the payment of fees for the prisoner's utilities services under AS 33.30.017;

(6) for the purchase of clothing and commissary items for the prisoner's personal use.

(d) A prisoner's compensation remaining after any deductions under (b) of this section and disbursements under (c) of this section is to be credited to the prisoner and, except as provided in (e) of this section, must be retained by the department for the primary purpose of being available to the prisoner at the time of release. The commissioner shall maintain individual prisoner accounts for those earnings. The commissioner may, however, permit the prisoner to draw on a portion of that money for other purposes that the commissioner considers appropriate.

(e) If a prisoner escapes, a portion of the retained compensation of the prisoner, as determined by the commissioner, is to be forfeited. The commissioner shall deposit forfeited compensation in the general fund.

If the record is prepared or maintained in an electronic data base, the official custodian of the record may provide the requesting agency with a copy of the electronic record and a statement certifying its contents.

An appeal shall be commenced by the prisoner filing a notice of appeal and other required documents in accordance with AS 09.19 and the applicable rules of court governing administrative appeals that do not conflict with AS 09.19.

(3) because of insufficient evidence if the record described in (a) of this section shows that the disciplinary decision was based on some evidence that could support the decision reached.

(c) The court shall enter judgment setting aside or affirming the disciplinary decision without limiting or controlling the discretion vested in the department to allocate resources within the department and to control security and administration within the prison system.

## Chapter 35. Agreement on Detainers.

###### Sec. 33.35.010.   Agreement enacted.

The Agreement on Detainers is enacted into law and entered into by the State of Alaska with all other jurisdictions legally joining in it in a form substantially as follows:

THE AGREEMENT ON DETAINERS.   Article IThe party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of those charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints.  The party states also find that proceedings with reference to charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures.  It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide those cooperative procedures.

Article II  As used in this agreement, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

(1) "state" means a state of the United States, the United States of America, a territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;

(2) "sending state" means a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that the prisoner initiates a request for final disposition under Article III of this agreement or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated under Article IV of this agreement;

(3) "receiving state" means the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint under Article III or Article IV of this agreement.

Article III   (a) When a person is serving a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and when during the term of imprisonment there is pending in another party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, the prisoner shall be brought to trial within 180 days after the prisoner has had delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of imprisonment and a request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint. However, for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or counsel for the prisoner being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.  The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.

(b) The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) of this article shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.

(c) The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform the prisoner of the source and contents of any detainer against the prisoner, and shall also inform the prisoner of the right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based.

(d) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner under paragraph (a) of this article shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed.  The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceedings being initiated by the prisoner.  Any notification sent under this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request, and the certificate.  If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated by this article before the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, that indictment, information or complaint is of no further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing it with prejudice.

(e) A request for final disposition made by a prisoner under paragraph (a) of this article shall also be considered a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated or included by reason of paragraph (d) of this article, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence imposed upon the prisoner there, after completion of the prisoner's term of imprisonment in the sending state.  The request for final disposition also constitutes a consent by the prisoner to the production of the prisoner's body in any court where the prisoner's presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph prevents the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.

(f) Escape from custody by the prisoner after the execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) of this article shall void the request.

Article IV   (a) The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending is entitled to have a prisoner, against whom the officer has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state, made available in accordance with Article V(a) of this agreement upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated; provided that the court having jurisdiction of an indictment, information or complaint must have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request; and provided that there shall be a period of 30 days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request is honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon the governor's own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.

(b) Upon receipt of the officer's written request as provided in paragraph (a) of this article, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.  Those authorities shall at the same time furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons for the request.

(c) In any proceeding under this article, trial shall begin within 120 days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state.  However, for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or counsel for the prisoner being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.

(d) Nothing contained in this article may be construed to deprive a prisoner of any right that the prisoner may have to contest the legality of the prisoner's delivery as provided in paragraph (a) of this article, but the prisoner's delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state had not affirmatively consented to or ordered the delivery.

(e) If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated by this agreement before the prisoner's return to the prisoner's original place of imprisonment under Article V(e) of this agreement, the indictment, information or complaint is not of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing it with prejudice.

Article V   (a) In response to a request made under Article III or Article IV of this agreement, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of a prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where the indictment, information or complaint is pending against the prisoner in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had.  If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state is entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place of trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.

(b) The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand:

(1) proper identification and evidence of the authority of the officer or other representative to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given; and

(2) a certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made.

(c) If the appropriate authority refuses or fails to accept temporary custody of the prisoner, or if an action on the indictment, information or complaint, on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged, is not brought to trial within the period provided in Article III or Article IV of this agreement, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing it with prejudice, and any detainer based on it shall cease to be of any force or effect.

(d) The temporary custody referred to in this agreement is only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or for prosecution on any other charge arising out of the same transaction.  Except for the prisoner's attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which the prisoner's presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.

(e) At the earliest practicable time consistent with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.

(f) During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.

(g) For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be considered to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state.  Any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.

(h) From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner under this agreement until the prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the untried indictments, informations or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner. The provisions of this paragraph govern unless the states concerned have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities between themselves.  Nothing in this agreement may be considered to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of or the responsibility for costs.

Article VI   (a) In determining the duration and expiration dates of the time periods provided in Articles III and IV of this agreement, the running of those time periods shall be tolled when and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter.

(b) No provision of this agreement, and no remedy made available by this agreement, apply to a person who is adjudged to be mentally ill.

Article VII  Each state party to this agreement shall designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other party states, shall adopt regulations to carry out the terms and provisions of this agreement, and who shall provide, inside and outside the state, information necessary to the effective operation of this agreement.

Article VIII  This agreement shall enter into full force and effect as to a party state when that state has enacted it into law.  A state party to this agreement may withdraw from it by enacting a statute repealing it. However, the withdrawal of any state does not affect the status of any proceedings already initiated by inmates or by state officers at the time the withdrawal takes effect, nor does it affect their rights in respect to those proceedings.

Article IX  This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes.  The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability of a provision to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability of it to any government, agency, person or circumstance is not affected. If this agreement is held to be contrary to the constitution of any party state, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

###### Sec. 33.35.020.   "Appropriate court" defined.

The phrase "appropriate court" in AS 33.35.010, with reference to the courts of this state, means the superior court.

###### Sec. 33.35.030.   Enforcement.

#### Article 1. Interstate Corrections Compact.

## Chapter 36. Interstate Corrections Compacts.

###### Sec. 33.36.010.   Compact enacted.

The Interstate Corrections Compact as contained in this section is enacted into law and entered into on behalf of the State of Alaska with any other states legally joining in it in a form substantially as follows. It is the policy of the State of Alaska not to transfer a resident inmate outside of the state under this compact if that inmate's continued confinement in Alaska will better facilitate rehabilitation or treatment:

The party states, desiring by common action to fully utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide those facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, thereby serving the best interests of the offenders and of society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs.  The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources.

As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

(a) "state" means a state of the United States, the United States of America, a territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;

(b) "sending state" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had;

(c) "receiving state" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had;

(d) "inmate" means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to, or confined in a penal or correctional institution;

(e) "institution" means any penal or correctional facility, including but not limited to a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates, as defined in (d) of this article, may lawfully be confined.

(a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states.  Such a contract shall provide for:

(1) its duration;

(2) payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and the participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance;

(3) participation in programs of inmate employment, if any; the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account of their employment; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting from their employment;

(4) delivery and retaking of inmates;

(5) other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states.

(b) The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of a contract entered into under this compact, and nothing in such a contract may be inconsistent with this compact.

(a) Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, which state has entered into a contract under Article III, decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, those authorities may direct that the confinement be in an institution within the territory of the other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.

(b) The appropriate officials of a state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to an institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates, for the purpose of inspecting the facilities of the institution and visiting those of its inmates who may be confined in the institution.

(c) Inmates confined in an institution under this compact are at all times subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed from the institution for transfer to a prison or other institution in the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; however, the sending state continues to be obligated to make any payments that may be required under a contract entered into the terms of Article III of this compact.

(d) A receiving state shall provide regular reports to a sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions under this compact, including a conduct record of each inmate, and certify that record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of the inmate's record in determining and altering the disposition of that inmate in accordance with the law in the sending state and in order that the record may be a source of information for the sending state.

(e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution under the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution.

(f) Any hearing to which an inmate, confined under this compact, may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state.  The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for those hearings which may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state.  If a hearing is had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing as prescribed by the sending state shall be made.  That record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted immediately to the officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In a proceeding had under the provisions of this subsection, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination may be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.

(g) An inmate confined under this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, agree upon release in some other place.  The sending state shall bear the cost of the return of an inmate to its territory.

(h) An inmate confined under the terms of this compact has all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have those obligations modified or the inmate's status changed on account of an action or proceeding in which the inmate could have participated if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state located in that state.

(i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for or otherwise function with respect to an inmate may not be deprived of or restricted in the exercise of any power in respect to an inmate confined under the terms of this compact.

(a) A decision of the sending state in respect to a matter over which it retains jurisdiction under this compact is conclusive upon and not reviewable in the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate in that state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed in that state a criminal offense, the inmate may not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for the offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates under this compact through any state party to this compact without interference.

(b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which the inmate is confined under this compact is considered a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated.  In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings is that of the sending state, but nothing contained in this compact may be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.

A state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or a contract under it and an inmate in a receiving state under this compact may participate in a federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision; however, if the program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required.

When this compact has been enacted into law by any two states, it becomes effective and binding upon them.  Thereafter, this compact becomes effective and binding as to any other state upon similar action by that state.

This compact continues in force and remains binding upon a party state until the state enacts a statute repealing the compact and providing for sending formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states.  An actual withdrawal does not take effect until one year after the notices provided in the statute have been sent.  A withdrawal does not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed under this compact before the effective date of withdrawal.  Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, those inmates it may have confined under the provisions of this compact.

Nothing contained in this compact may be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.

The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and are severable.  If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of a participating state or of the United States, or the applicability of it to a government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability of it to a government, agency, person or circumstance is not affected by that holding.  If this compact is held contrary to the constitution of a state participating in it, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

#### Article 3. Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision.

###### Sec. 33.36.110.   Authorizing governor to execute interstate compact.

The governor of this state is authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of this state with any of the United States legally joining in the compact in the form substantially as follows:

The compacting states to this Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized in accordance with the by-laws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions.

The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.

It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created under this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states, to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.

In addition, this compact will create an Interstate Commission that will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections, or other criminal justice agencies that will adopt rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in that activity.

The compacting states recognize that there is no right of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and by-laws and rules adopted under the compact.

It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created in this compact are the formation of public policies and are, as a result, public business.
