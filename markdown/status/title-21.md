Participation in the organization or a subscription to any of its documents should never be considered to be insurance. Regardless of whether you receive a payment for medical expenses or whether this organization continues to operate, you are always personally responsible for the payment of your own medical bills."

(b) Every person being examined, or from whom information is sought, and its officers, employees, agents, and representatives shall provide to the director timely, convenient, and free access, at all reasonable hours at its office, the books, accounts, records, documents, files, information, assets, and matters in their possession or control relating to the subject of the examination, including all computer or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business, and affairs of the person being examined, and shall facilitate and aid the examination as far as it is in their power to do so, including providing to the director, at the expense of the person being examined, a copy of any document requested during the examination. The director may suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue or renew a license or authority of a person engaging in the business of insurance or other business under the jurisdiction of the director if the person or an officer, director, employee, or agent of the person refuses to submit to examination or to comply with a reasonable written request of an examiner.

(1) a policyholder or claimant under an insurance policy;

(2) a grantor of a mortgage or similar instrument on the examiner's residence to a regulated entity if obtained under customary terms;

(3) an investment owner in shares of regulated mutual fund companies; or

(1) approving the examination report as filed or approving the examination report with modification or corrections;

(d) The director may disclose the content of an examination report, preliminary examination report or results, or a matter relating to it to the insurance division of this or another state or country and to law enforcement officers of this or another jurisdiction.

###### Sec. 21.06.160.   Examination expense.

(a) Each person examined, other than examinations under  AS 21.06.130  and examinations of managing general agents, third-party administrators, reinsurance intermediary managers, motor vehicle service contract providers, or surplus lines brokers, shall pay a reasonable rate calculated on salary, benefit costs, and estimated division overhead for time spent directly or indirectly related to the examination. Each person examined, other than examinations under  AS 21.06.130, shall pay actual out-of-pocket business expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by division staff examiners and shall pay the compensation of a contract examiner, to be set at a reasonable customary rate, for conducting the examination upon presentation of a detailed account of the charges and expenses by the director or under an order of the director.  The director may waive payment of all or part of the actual out-of-pocket business expenses incurred by division staff examiners, or the compensation of a contract examiner, if the director determines that payment of the expenses or compensation creates a financial hardship for a managing general agent, third-party administrator, reinsurance intermediary manager, motor vehicle service contract provider, or surplus lines broker. The accounting may either be presented periodically during the course of the examination or at the termination of the examination. A person may not pay and an examiner may not accept additional compensation for an examination. A person shall pay examination expenses to the division under this subsection using an electronic payment method specified by the director.

(b) The director shall pay into the general fund of the state all money received under (a) of this section.

The contract between the state and a contract examiner who will receive direct payment under this subsection must require that the examiner provide the director with a copy of each billing for the examination.

(c) In addition to other penalties provided by this title, if the person fails to pay the charges and expenses prescribed in (a) of this section, the amount may be recovered by suit by the attorney general on behalf of the state and restored to the general fund. The amount due shall be a first lien upon all of the assets and property of the person in this state.

(b) A person may not bring a civil action if the civil action arises out of the act of communicating or delivering information to the director, a representative of the director, or an examiner who is performing an examination under this title.

(c) This section does not abrogate or modify the common law or other statutory privilege or immunity.

(d) This section does not preclude liability for civil damages as a result of reckless, wilful, or intentional misconduct.

###### Sec. 21.06.170.   Witnesses, evidence, and contempt.

If, in connection with an examination of an insurer, the director desires to examine an officer, director, or manager who is then outside this state, the director is authorized to conduct and to enforce by appropriate and available means an examination under oath in another state or a territory of the United States in which the officer, director, or manager may then presently be, to the full extent permitted by the laws of the other state or territory, this special authorization considered. An administrative law judge from the office of administrative hearings (AS 44.64.010) conducting a hearing under this title may, in the course of the hearing, exercise the powers granted to the director under this subsection.

(b) Witness fees and mileage, if claimed, shall be allowed the same as for testimony in a court.  Witness fees, mileage, and the actual expenses necessarily incurred in securing attendance of witnesses and their testimony shall be itemized, and shall be paid by the person being examined if the person is found to have violated the law regarding the matter for which the witness was subpoenaed, or shall be paid by the person, if other than the director, at whose request the hearing is held.

(c) Subpoenas of witnesses shall be served in the same manner as if issued from a court.

(d) If a person disobeys or resists a lawful order of the administrative law judge or director, refuses to respond to a subpoena, refuses to take oath or affirmation as a witness, refuses to be examined, or is guilty of misconduct at a hearing or so near the hearing as to obstruct the proceeding, the administrative law judge or director shall certify the facts to the superior court where the hearing is held, and, upon certification, the court shall issue an order directing the person to appear before the court and show cause why the person should not be punished for contempt.

(e)  [Repealed,§22 ch 149 SLA 1984.]

(4) provides that, in the event of a dispute between the parties to the contract, a fair, prompt, and mutual dispute resolution process must be used; at a minimum, the process must provide

(A) for an initial meeting at which all parties are present or represented by individuals with authority regarding the matters in dispute; the meeting shall be held within 10 working days after the health care insurer receives written notice of the dispute or gives written notice to the provider, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing to a different schedule;

(B) that if, within 30 days following the initial meeting, the parties have not resolved the dispute, the dispute shall be submitted to mediation directed by a mediator who is mutually agreeable to the parties and who is not regularly under contract to or employed by either of the parties; each party shall bear its proportionate share of the cost of mediation, including the mediator fees;

(C) that if, after a period of 60 days following commencement of mediation, the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, either party may seek other relief allowed by law;

(D) that the parties shall agree to negotiate in good faith in the initial meeting and in mediation;

(7) defines words in a clear and concise manner.

(b) A contract between a participating health care provider and a health care insurer that offers a health care insurance policy may not contain a provision that

(1) has as its predominant purpose the creation of direct financial incentives to the health care provider for withholding covered medical care services that are medically necessary; nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit a contract between a participating health care provider and a health care insurer from containing incentives for efficient management of the utilization and cost of covered medical care services;

(2) requires the provider to contract for all products that are currently offered or that may be offered in the future by the health care insurer; or

(a) If a health care insurer offers a health care insurance policy that provides for coverage of medical care services only if the services are furnished through a network of health care providers that have entered into a contract with the health care insurer, the health care insurer shall also offer a non-network option to covered persons at initial enrollment, as provided under (c) of this section. The non-network option may require that a covered person pay a higher deductible, copayment, or premium for the plan if the higher deductible, copayment, or premium results from increased costs caused by the use of a non-network provider. This subsection does not apply to a covered person who is offered non-network coverage through another health care insurance policy or through another health care insurer.

(b) The amount of any additional premium charged by the health care insurer for the additional cost of the creation and maintenance of the option described in (a) of this section and the amount of any additional cost sharing imposed under this option shall be paid by the covered person unless it is paid by an employer or other person through agreement with the health care insurer.

(c) A covered person may make a change to the medical care coverage option provided under this section only during a time period determined by the health care insurer. The time period described in this subsection must occur at least annually and last for at least 15 working days.

(e) Except as provided in this subsection and (h) of this section, a health care insurer that offers a health care insurance policy shall permit a covered person to receive medically necessary or appropriate specialty care, subject to appropriate referral procedures, from any qualified participating health care provider that is available to accept the individual for medical care. This subsection does not apply to specialty care if the health care insurer clearly informs covered persons of the limitations on choice of participating health care providers with respect to medical care. In this subsection,

(1) "appropriate referral procedures" means procedures for referring patients to other health care providers as set out in the applicable member policy and as described under (a) of this section;

(2) "specialty care" means care provided by a health care provider with training and experience in treating a particular injury, illness, or condition.

(f) If a contract between a health care provider and a health care insurer is terminated, a covered person may continue to be treated by that health care provider as provided in this subsection. If a covered person is pregnant or being actively treated by a provider on the date of the termination of the contract between that provider and the health care insurer, the covered person may continue to receive medical care services from that provider as provided in this subsection, and the contract between the health care insurer and the provider shall remain in force with respect to the continuing treatment. The covered person shall be treated for the purposes of benefit determination or claim payment as if the provider were still under contract with the health care insurer. However, treatment is required to continue only while the health care insurance policy remains in effect and

(1) for the period that is the longest of the following:

(A) the end of the current policy or plan year;

(B) up to 90 days after the termination date, if the event triggering the right to continuing treatment is part of an ongoing course of treatment;

(C) through completion of postpartum care, if the covered person is pregnant on the date of termination; or

(2) until the end of the medically necessary treatment for the condition, disease, illness, or injury if the person has a terminal condition, disease, illness, or injury; in this paragraph, "terminal" means a life expectancy of less than one year.

(g) The requirements of this section do not apply to medical care services covered by Medicaid.

(h) A health care insurer that offers a health care insurance policy that provides coverage for obstetrical and gynecological care and that requires designation by a covered person of a participating primary care provider may not require authorization or referral by any person, including a primary care provider, for a female patient to receive obstetrical and gynecological care from a participating health care professional who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. A participating health care professional who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology shall agree to adhere to the health care insurer's policies and procedures, including procedures regarding referrals, obtaining prior authorization, and providing services under a treatment plan, if any, approved by the health care insurer. A health care insurer shall treat authorizations by a health care professional who specializes in obstetrical or gynecological care as the authorization of the primary care provider. This subsection may not be construed to

(1) waive any exclusions of coverage under the terms and conditions of the health care insurance policy with respect to coverage of obstetrical and gynecological care; or

(2) preclude a health care insurer from requiring that the health care provider who specializes in obstetrical or gynecological care to notify the primary care provider or the health care insurer of treatment decisions.

An insurer that fails to comply with this subsection is subject to the penalties specified in (e) of this section, calculated from the filing and fee due date established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

(g) An insurer shall file with the director or the director's designee an annual audited financial report for the previous year by June 1 of each year unless, under a regulation adopted by the director, the director grants an exemption based on a finding that filing an annual audited financial report would constitute a financial or organizational hardship on the insurer.

(a) Each authorized insurer, and each formerly authorized insurer with respect to premiums written while an authorized insurer in this state, shall file with the director, on or before March 1 in each year, a report of all insurance business written or contracted in the state, with proper proportionate allocation of premium for the property, subjects, or risks in the state insured under policies or contracts covering property, subjects, or risks located or resident in more than one state, during the preceding year ending December 31. The report must show

(1) the amounts paid policyholders on losses;

(2) the total direct premium income including policy membership and other fees, premiums paid by application of dividends, refunds, savings coupon, and similar returns or credits to payment of premiums for new or additional or extended or renewed insurance, charges for payment of premium in installments, and all other consideration for insurance from all kinds and classes of insurance whether designated a premium or otherwise;

(3) the amounts paid policyholders as returned premiums;

(4) the amounts paid policyholders as dividends.

(b) Each insurer, and each formerly authorized insurer with respect to premiums written while an authorized insurer in this state, shall pay a tax on the total direct premium written during the year ending on the preceding December 31 and paid for the insurance of property or risks resident or located in the state, other than wet marine and transportation insurance, after deducting from the total direct premium income the applicable cancellations, returned premiums, the unabsorbed portion of any deposit premium, all policy dividends, unabsorbed premiums refunded to policyholders, refunds, savings, savings coupons, and other similar returns paid or credited to policyholders with respect to their policies. Deductions may not be made of cash surrender value of policies. Considerations received on annuity contracts are not included in the direct premium income and are not subject to tax. The tax shall be paid to the director at least annually but not more often than once each quarter on the dates specified by the director. The method of payment must be by the electronic or other payment method specified by the director. Except as provided under (m) of this section, the tax is computed at the rate of

(1) for domestic and foreign insurers, except hospital and medical service corporations, 2.7 percent;

(2) for hospital and medical service corporations, six percent of their gross premiums less claims paid.

(c)  [Repealed,§48 ch 29 SLA 1987.]

(d) An authorized insurer shall, with respect to all wet marine and transportation contracts written in this state during the preceding calendar year, pay to the director a tax of three-quarters of one percent on its gross underwriting profit. The director shall specify the dates that payment is due and the electronic or other method by which payment is to be made. The gross underwriting profit is computed by deducting, from the net premiums on wet marine and transportation insurance contracts, the net losses paid during the calendar year under the contracts. In the case of an insurer issuing participating contracts, the gross underwriting profit may not include, for computation of the tax prescribed by this section, the amounts refunded or paid as participation dividends by the insurers to the holders of the contracts. In this subsection,

(1) "net losses" means gross losses less salvage and recoveries on reinsurance ceded;

(2) "net premiums" means gross premiums less all return premiums and premiums for reinsurance.

(e) Payment to the director by an insurer of the tax upon its premiums required by this section shall be in lieu of all other taxes imposed by the state upon premiums, franchise, privilege, or other taxes measured by income of the insurer.

(f) The state hereby pre-empts the field of imposing excise, privilege, franchise, income, license, permit, registration, and similar taxes, licenses, and fees upon insurers and their general agents, agents, and representatives as such; and on the intangible property of insurers or agents; and all political subdivisions of agencies in the state, including home rule boroughs or cities, are prohibited from imposing or levying upon insurers, or upon their general agents, agents, and representatives as such, any tax, license, or fee. However, this subsection shall not be construed as prohibiting the imposition by political subdivisions of taxes upon real and tangible personal property of insurers and their general agents, agents, and representatives.

(g) An insurer shall pay to the division a late payment fee of $50 a month plus five percent of the tax due each calendar month or part of a month during which the insurer fails to pay the full amount of the tax, or a portion of the tax, and interest at the rate of one percent of the tax due each calendar month or part of a month for the period the insurer fails to pay the premium tax in this section or in AS 21.09.270. The late payment fee, not including interest, may not exceed $250 plus 25 percent of the tax due. The tax payment shall be made in the form required by the director, or a penalty shall be added to the tax of 25 percent of the tax due, not to exceed $2,000, with a minimum penalty of $100. In addition to any other penalty provided by law, a civil penalty may be assessed of not more than $10,000 if an insurer wilfully violates this section. The director may suspend or revoke the certificate of authority of an insurer that fails to pay taxes, a penalty, or a late payment fee as required under this section.

(h) The provisions of this section do not apply to title insurance companies. A premium tax on title insurance companies shall be levied in accordance with the provisions of AS 21.66.110.

(i) Premiums paid by the state for insurance policies and contracts purchased under the provisions of AS 39.30 are exempt from taxation under this section. An insurer may not include the tax imposed under this section in a premium charged on an insurance policy or contract purchased by the state under the provisions of AS 39.30. An insurer may claim the exemption on forms provided by the division of insurance.

(j) The provisions of AS 21.96.070 apply to a taxpayer who is required to pay a tax due under this section.

(k) If, within three years after the date the tax under this section was due, an insurer discovers a mistake or misinterpretation that resulted in an overpayment of the tax in an amount exceeding $250 in any one calendar year, the insurer may make a written request to the director for a refund. If the director determines a valid mistake or misinterpretation has occurred, the director shall refund to the insurer the amount of the excess tax by granting, at the director's discretion, a monetary refund or premium tax credit. A premium tax credit shall be used in the next calendar year to the extent possible and any unused credit shall be paid as a monetary refund. A premium tax credit may not reduce the payable tax, calculated without use of the credit, to less than zero.

(l) A premium tax credit granted under (k) of this section may not carry over as an attribute in a transaction under AS 21.69.610, 21.69.620, AS 21.78, or a similar transaction entered into by a foreign insurer.

(m) The tax imposed under this section for an individual life insurance policy shall be computed at the rate of

(1) 2.7 percent of policy year premium up to $100,000; and

(2) 0.08 percent of policy year premium exceeding $100,000.

(n) Premiums on which taxes are paid under (m)(2) of this section are not subject to AS 21.09.270.

(o) A qualified insurer is entitled to a premium tax credit under AS 21.55.220.

###### Sec. 21.12.020.   Reinsurance credit allowed a domestic ceding insurer.

(a) Credit for reinsurance transactions is allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a deduction from liability because of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets the requirements of (1)§(7) of this subsection. The director may, by regulation adopted under (g)(2) of this section, specify additional requirements relating to, or setting out, the valuation of assets or reserve credits, the amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in (g)(2) of this section, and the circumstances under which credit will be reduced or eliminated.

Credit is allowed under (3) or (4) of this subsection only if the applicable requirements in (b) of this section have been satisfied. Credit is allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that

(1) is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state;

(2) is accredited by the director as a reinsurer in this state; an accredited reinsurer is one that

(A) files with the director evidence of submission to this state's jurisdiction, submits to this state's authority to examine its books and records, is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state that is accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien admitted insurer, is entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state that is accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners;

(B) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers; an assuming insurer is considered to meet the requirement at the time of application if the assuming insurer maintains at least $20,000,000 in policyholder surplus and the assuming insurer's accreditation has not been denied by the director within 90 days after application to the director; and

(C) the director shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions under which an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in a qualifying jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the director as a certified reinsurer, subject to the following provisions:

(i) to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of an alien assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the director shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits, and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the United States; a qualified jurisdiction shall agree to share information and cooperate with the director with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction; the director may not recognize a jurisdiction as a qualified jurisdiction if the director determines that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgments and arbitration awards; the director may consider additional factors when making an eligibility determination under this subparagraph;

The director may remove a jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon determination that the jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction in accordance with a process set out in regulation by the director. Upon removal of a reciprocal jurisdiction from the list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer that has a home office or is domiciled in that jurisdiction shall be allowed if otherwise allowed under this section.

If a materially false statement regarding an insurer's risk based capital or an inappropriate comparison of any other amount to the insurer's risk based capital is published and the insurer is able to demonstrate with substantial proof, as determined by the director, the falsity or inappropriateness of the statement, the insurer may publish an announcement exclusively to rebut the materially false statement or inappropriate comparison.

(c) The director may use the risk based capital instructions, report, adjusted report, plan, and revised plan only for monitoring the solvency of an insurer or for determining the need for corrective action by an insurer.

In place of the unearned premium reserve required on surety bonds under AS 21.18.060, the department may require a surety insurer or limited surety insurer to set up and maintain a reserve on all bail bonds or other single premium bonds without a definite expiration date, furnished in judicial proceedings, equal to 25 percent of the total consideration charged for the bonds that are outstanding as of the date of a current financial statement of the insurer.

###### Sec. 21.18.080.   Reserve standards for health insurance.

(c) A gross premium valuation must be performed whenever there is an indication that reserves and future premiums may be insufficient to cover future claims for a particular block of policies or for the entire health insurance block. If a reserve inadequacy is determined to exist, the loss must be immediately recognized and reserves increased to account for the inadequacy. The increased reserves will be considered minimum reserves.

(b) Policy reserves are not required for health insurance policies that cannot be continued after one year from the date of issue.

(c) The structure of valuation net premiums used under a health insurance policy must be consistent with the structure of gross premiums on the date the policy is issued.

(d) For return of premium benefits, deferred cash benefits, policies with premium rates that are not guaranteed, and where the effects of insurer underwriting by policy duration are specifically used in the valuation morbidity standard, termination rates that exceed the mortality rates in the tables required in (g)(2) of this section may be used but may not exceed the lesser of

(1) 80 percent of the total termination rate used in the calculation of gross premiums; or

(2) eight percent.

(e) The methods and procedures used to determine health insurance policy reserves must be consistent with the methods and procedures used to determine claim reserves for a health insurance policy.

(f) Negative reserves on a benefit may be offset against positive reserves for other benefits in the same policy, but the total policy reserve with respect to all benefits combined may not be less than zero.

(5) a morbidity assumption for

(A) individual disability income insurance issued (i) after December 31, 1997, equal to Tables A or B of the 1985 Commissioners' Individual Disability Tables for policies; and (ii) before January 1, 1998, equal to the 1964 or 1985 Commissioners' Individual Disability Tables; the insurer shall indicate which morbidity table the insurer will use for all individual disability income policies issued in a calendar year;

(B) group disability income insurance issued

(i) after December 31, 1997, equal to the 1987 Commissioners' Group Disability Table; and

(2) one-year full preliminary term method for a policy or certificate issued after July 1, 1997.

(j) Reserve adjustments due to rate changes, revised assumptions, or other reasons for return of premium or other deferred cash benefits must be applied on the effective date of the adoption of the reserve adjustment.

(k) An alternative method or basis of determining policy reserves may be used if the aggregate policy reserve is not less than the aggregate policy reserves determined under (c)§(j) of this section.

(l) An insurer shall annually review prospective policy liabilities on policies valued by tabular reserves to determine the continuing adequacy and reasonableness of the tabular reserves given future gross premiums. The insurer shall make adjustments to the tabular reserves if the tests indicate that the basis of the reserves is no longer adequate.

(m) Policy reserves that are valued based on the 1964 or 1985 Commissioners Individual Disability Tables must include a provision for a waiver of premium benefit with the minimum reserve for the benefit equal to the valuation net premium to be waived.

(n) Policy reserves for long-term care insurance may not be less than the net single premium for any nonforfeiture benefits provided by the policy or certificate.

###### Sec. 21.18.084.   Claim reserves for health insurance.

(a) Claim reserves are required for all incurred and unpaid claims on all health insurance policies.

(b) Claim expense reserves are required for the estimated expense of settlement of all incurred and unpaid claims.

(c) Claim reserves for prior valuation years must be tested for adequacy and reasonableness using claim runoff schedules in accordance with the statutory annual statement, including consideration of any residual unpaid liability. Claim reserve adequacy must be determined in the aggregate.

(d) Claim reserves must be determined as follows:

(1) for policies that require policy reserves under AS 21.18.082(a), based on a maximum interest rate equal to the maximum interest rate allowed under AS 21.18.110 for the valuation of whole life insurance issued on the same date as the date the claim was incurred;

(2) for policies that do not require policy reserves under AS 21.18.082(b), based on a maximum interest rate equal to the maximum interest rate allowed under AS 21.18.110 for the valuation of single premium immediate annuities issued on the same date as the date the claim was incurred less 100 basis points;

(3) except as provided in (4) and (5) of this subsection, a morbidity assumption for

(A) individual disability income insurance must be equal to the morbidity assumption used in determining policy reserves under AS 21.18.082(g)(5);

(B) group disability income insurance for policies issued

(i) after December 31, 1997, must be equal to the 1987 Commissioners Group Disability Table; and

(ii) before January 1, 1998, must be equal to the morbidity assumption in use by the insurer before January 1, 1998;

(C) accidental death benefits must be equal to the actual amount of claims incurred; and

(D) all other individual or group policy benefits must be equal to a morbidity table approved by the director and established for reserve determination by an actuary qualified to determine the morbidity table;

(4) for individual or group disability claims with a duration from disablement of less than two years, morbidity assumptions may be based on the insurer's experience if determined credible by the insurer or upon another basis designed to place a sound value on the liabilities as determined by the insurer;

(5) if approved by the director, reserves for group disability income claims with a duration from disablement of more than two years but less than five years may be based on the insurer's experience for which the insurer maintains control of underwriting and claim administration; request for approval to use this modified reserve basis must include

(A) an analysis of the credibility of the experience;

(B) a description of how all the insurer's experience is proposed to be used in setting the reserves;

(C) a description and quantification of the margins to be included;

(D) a summary of the financial impact that the proposed plan of modification would have on the insurer's last filed annual statement;

(E) a copy of the approval from the state of domicile; and

(F) all other information requested by the director;

(6) any generally accepted actuarial reserving method or other reasonable method approved by the director may be used; the method used to estimate liabilities may be an aggregate method; approximations based on groupings and averages may also be used.

(e) Claim reserves that are valued based on the 1964 or 1985 Commissioners' Individual Disability Tables must include a provision for a waiver of premium benefit with the minimum reserve for the benefit equal to the valuation net premium to be waived.

###### Sec. 21.18.086.   Premium reserves for health insurance.

(a) Unearned premium reserves must be established for the period of coverage for which premiums, other than premiums paid in advance, have been paid beyond the date of valuation.

(b) Due and unpaid premiums that are carried as an asset in the annual statement must be treated as premiums in force and are subject to the unearned premium reserve requirements of this section. Unpaid commissions, premium taxes, and costs of collection associated with due and unpaid premiums must be carried in the annual statement as an offsetting liability.

(c) Gross premiums paid in advance for a period of coverage starting after the next premium due date following the valuation date may be discounted to the valuation date and must be held as a separate liability in the annual statement or as an addition to the unearned premium reserve established in this section.

(d) The minimum unearned premium reserve for a policy is the pro rata unearned modal premium that applies to the valuation period beyond the date of valuation. If a policy reserve is required for a policy, the unearned modal premium is the valuation net modal premium on the policy reserve. If no policy reserve is required for a policy, the unearned modal premium is the gross modal premium for the policy.

(e) The sum of the unearned premium and policy reserves for all policies may not be less than the gross modal unearned premium reserve on all policies as of the date of valuation. The total unearned premium and policy reserves may not be less than the expected claims for the period after the valuation date represented by the unearned premium reserve.

(f) An insurer may use approximations and estimates in determining premium reserves, including groupings, averages, and aggregate estimates. The approximations or estimates must be tested periodically and not less frequently than triennially to determine adequacy.

(g) Premium reserves based on the 1964 or 1985 Commissioners' Individual Disability Tables must include policies on premium waiver as in-force contracts and establish a minimum reserve for a waiver of premium benefit equal to the unearned modal valuation net premium being waived.

###### Sec. 21.18.090.   Loss reserves, liability insurance, and workers' compensation. [Repealed,§53 ch 96 SLA 2004.]

###### Sec. 21.18.100.   Increase of reserves.

If loss experience shows that an insurer's loss reserves or reserves for incurred but not reported losses, however computed or estimated, are inadequate, the director shall require the insurer to maintain loss reserves or reserves for incurred but not reported losses in the increased amount needed to make them adequate.

###### Sec. 21.18.110.   Standard valuation law§Life insurance.

(a) The director shall annually value, or cause to be valued, the reserve liabilities (hereinafter called reserves) for all outstanding life insurance policies, annuity and pure endowment contracts, and deposit-type contracts of every life insurer doing business in this state issued before the operative date of the valuation manual described in AS 21.18.112. In calculating the reserves for policies and contracts issued before the operative date of the valuation manual described in AS 21.18.112, the director may use group methods and approximate averages for fractions of a year or otherwise. For an alien insurer, the valuation shall be limited to the alien insurer's insurance transactions in the United States. For the purpose of making the valuation, the director may employ a qualified actuary who shall be paid by the insurer for which the service is rendered. For a foreign or alien insurer, the director may accept, in lieu of the valuation of the reserves required of a foreign or alien insurer, a valuation made, or caused to be made, by the insurance supervisory official of a state or other jurisdiction if the valuation complies with the minimum standard provided in this section. This subsection provides for the minimum standard for the valuation of reserves for policies and contracts subject to this subsection and applies to a policy and contract issued before the operative date of the valuation manual described in AS 21.18.112. An insurer that has adopted a standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this section may, with the approval of the director, adopt a lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum provided in this section.

(b) This subsection applies to only those policies and contracts issued on or after the operative date of AS 21.45.300 except as provided in (c)§(k) of this section, (5) and (6) of this subsection for group annuity and pure endowment contracts issued before that operative date, and AS 21.18.112(b):

(1) Except as provided in (c)§(k) of this section, (5) and (6) of this subsection, and AS 21.18.112(b), the minimum standard for the valuation of all these policies and contracts shall be the commissioners reserve evaluation methods defined in (2)(A) and (B), (4), and (7) of this subsection, and AS 21.18.112(b), three and one-half percent interest, or in the case of policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, issued on or after July 1, 1978, five and one-half percent interest for single premium life insurance policies and four and one-half percent interest for all other policies, and the following tables:

(A) for all ordinary policies of life insurance issued on the standard basis, excluding disability and accidental death benefits in the policies§the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, for policies issued before the operative date of AS 21.45.300(w), of the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance as amended, except that, for a category of policies issued on female risks, all modified net premiums and present values, referred to in (2) of this subsection, may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured; and for policies issued on or after the operative date of AS 21.45.300(w) of the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance as amended

(i) the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table;

(ii) at the election of the insurer for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with 10-year Select Mortality Factors; or

(iii) any ordinary mortality table, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that is approved by regulation adopted by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for the policies;

(B) for all industrial life insurance policies issued on the standard basis, excluding disability and accidental death benefits in the policies§the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table for the policies issued before the operative date of AS 21.45.300(l), of the Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance as amended, and for the policies issued on or after April 7, 1984, the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or any industrial mortality table, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that is approved by regulation adopted by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for those policies;

(C) for individual annuity and pure endowment contracts, excluding disability and accidental death benefits in the policies§the 1937 Standard Annuity Mortality Table, or, at the option of the insurer, the Annuity Mortality Table for 1949, ultimate, or any modification of either of these tables approved by the director;

(D) for group annuity and pure endowment contracts, excluding disability and accidental death benefits in the policies§the Group Annuity Mortality Table for 1951, any modification of the table approved by the director, or, at the option of the insurer, any of the tables or modification of tables specified for individual annuity and pure endowment contracts;

(E) for total and permanent disability benefits in or supplementary to ordinary policies or contracts§the tables of period 2 disablement rates and the 1930 to 1950 termination rates of the 1952 disability study of the society of actuaries, with due regard to the type of benefit or any table of disablement and termination rates adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that are approved by regulation adopted by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for the policies; the table shall, for active lives, be combined with a mortality table permitted for calculating the reserves for life insurance policies;

(F) for accidental death benefits in or supplementary to policies§the 1959 Accidental Death Benefits Table or any accidental death benefits table adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that is approved by regulation adopted by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for the policies combined with a mortality table permitted for calculating the reserves for life insurance policies;

(G) for group life insurance, life insurance issued on the substandard basis and other special benefits§tables approved by the director.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in (4) and (7) of this subsection, reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums, shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policies, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums; the modified net premiums for the policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all the modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of (A) over (B), as follows:

(A) a net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue of an annuity of one a year payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due; however, the net level annual premium may not exceed the net level annual premium on the 19-year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of the policy;

(B) a net one-year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year; notwithstanding this paragraph, for a life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1987, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess premium and that provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination of these in an amount greater than the excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioners reserve valuation method as of a policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date, except as otherwise provided in (4) of this subsection, shall be the greater of the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in (A) of this paragraph and the reserve as of the policy anniversary; the reserve shall be calculated as described in (A) of this paragraph, except that

(i) the present value shall be reduced by 15 percent of the amount of the excess first year premium;

(ii) all present values of benefits and premiums shall be determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date;

(iii) the policy shall be assumed to mature on the assumed ending date as an endowment; and

(iv) the cash surrender value provided on the assumed date shall be considered as an endowment benefit; in making the comparison in this subparagraph, the mortality and interest bases stated in (4) and (6) of this subsection and (c) of this section shall be used; in this subparagraph, the assumed ending date is the first policy anniversary on which the sum of the endowment benefit and cash surrender value then available is greater than the excess premium;

(C) reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method for

(i) life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums;

(ii) group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under 26 U.S.C. 408 (Internal Revenue Code), as amended;

(iii) disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts;

(iv) all other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of this paragraph, except that any extra premiums charged because of impairments or special hazards shall be disregarded in the determination of modified net premiums.

(3) Reserves for any category of policies, contracts, or benefits as established by the director, may be calculated at the option of the insurer according to standards that produce greater aggregate reserves for the category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this section, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, may not be higher than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits provided for in the policy or contract.

(4) If, in any contract year, the gross premium charged by a life insurer on a policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve on the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for that policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for the policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. In this paragraph, the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest are those standards referred to in (b) and (c) of this section. Notwithstanding this paragraph, for a life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1987, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess premium and that provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination of these in an amount greater than the excess premium, the provisions of this paragraph shall be applied as if the method used in calculating the reserve for such a policy were based on a net one-year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year. The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated under (2)(B) of this subsection, and the minimum reserve calculated under this paragraph.

(5) Except as provided in (c)§(k) of this section, the minimum standard for the valuation of all individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued on or after the operative date of this paragraph as set out in (6) of this subsection and for all annuities and pure endowments purchased on or after that date under group annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be the commissioners reserve valuation methods defined in (2) and (7) of this subsection and the following tables and interest rates:

(A) for individual single premium immediate annuity contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in those contracts§the 1971 individual annuity mortality table or an individual annuity mortality table, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that is approved by regulation adopted by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for the contracts, or any modification of these tables approved by the director and seven and one-half percent interest;

(B) for individual annuity and pure endowment contracts, other than single premium immediate annuity contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in those contracts§the 1971 individual annuity mortality table or an individual annuity mortality table, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that is approved by regulation adopted by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for the contracts, or any modification of these tables approved by the director and five and one-half percent interest for single premium deferred annuity and pure endowment contracts and four and one- half percent interest for all other comparable individual annuity and pure endowment contracts;

(C) for all annuities and pure endowments purchased under group annuity and pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits purchased under such contracts§1971 group annuity mortality table or a group annuity mortality table, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that is approved by regulation adopted by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for the annuities and pure endowments, or any modification of these tables approved by the director, and seven and one-half percent interest.

(6) After July 1, 1978, an insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of (5) of this subsection after a specified date before January 1, 1979, which shall be the operative date of that requirement for the insurer; however, an insurer may elect a different operative date for individual annuity and pure endowment contracts from that elected for group annuity and pure endowment contracts. If an insurer makes no election, the operative date of (5) of this subsection for the insurer is January 1, 1979.

(7) This paragraph applies to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement annuities under 26 U.S.C. 408 (Internal Revenue Code), as amended. Reserves according to the commissioners annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in those contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided for by those contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of that contract, that become payable before the end of that respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate, or rates, specified in those contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of those contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.

(c) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates defined in (d) of this section shall be the interest rates used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of

(1) a life insurance policy issued in a particular calendar year, on or after the operative date of AS 21.45.300(w);

(2) an individual annuity and pure endowment contract issued in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1984;

(3) an annuity and pure endowment purchased in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1984 under a group annuity and pure endowment contract; and

(4) the net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1984, in an amount held under a guaranteed interest contract.

(d) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, I, shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent

(1) for life insurance,

I = .03 + W(R1§.03) + W/2(R2§.09);

(2) for a single premium immediate annuity and for an annuity benefit involving a life contingency arising from another annuity with a cash settlement option and from a guaranteed interest contract with a cash settlement option,

I = .03 + W(R§.03)

where R1 is the lesser of R and .09,

R2 is the greater of R and .09,

R is the reference interest rate defined in (j) of this section, and

W is the weighting factor defined in (f) of this section;

(3) for other annuities with cash settlement options and other guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in (2) above, the formula for life insurance in (1) of this subsection shall apply to an annuity or guaranteed interest contract with a guarantee duration in excess of 10 years and the formula for a single premium immediate annuity in (2) of this subsection shall apply to an annuity or guaranteed interest contract with a guarantee duration of 10 years or less;

(4) for other annuities with no cash settlement options and for other guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for a single premium immediate annuity in (2) of this subsection shall apply;

(5) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for a single premium immediate annuity in (2) of this subsection shall apply.

(e) Notwithstanding (d) of this section, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for a life insurance policy differs from the corresponding actual rate for a similar policy issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for the life insurance policy shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For the purpose of this subsection, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate shall be determined for 1980 using the reference interest rate defined for 1979 and shall be determined for each following calendar year regardless of the operative date under AS 21.45.300(w).

(f) The weighting factors referred to in (c) of this section are as follows:

(1) weighting factors for life insurance:

(4) for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis, the weighting factors shown in (3) of this subsection are increased by .15 for plan type A, .25 for plan type B, and .05 for plan type C;

(5) for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis, other than those with no cash settlement options, that do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase and for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis that do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than 12 months beyond the valuation date, the weighting factors shown in (3) of this subsection or derived in (4) of this subsection are increased by .05.

(g) The guarantee duration for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of 20 years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence.

(h) In this section, "plan type" is defined as follows:

(1) plan type A: at any time policyholder may withdraw funds only

(A) with an adjustment to reflect a change in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer;

(B) without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more;

(C) as an immediate life annuity; or

(D) no withdrawal permitted;

(2) plan type B: before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only

(A) with adjustment to reflect a change in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer;

(B) without adjustment but in installments over five years or more; or

(C) no withdrawal permitted; at the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five years;

(3) plan type C: policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of an interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five years either

(A) without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer; or

(B) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.

(i) An insurer may elect to value a guaranteed interest contract with a cash settlement option and an annuity with a cash settlement option on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. A guaranteed interest contract with no cash settlement option and an annuity with no cash settlement option must be valued on an issue year basis. In this subsection an issue year basis of valuation means a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and the change in fund basis of valuation means a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.

(j) The reference interest rates referred to in (d) and (e) of this section are as follows:

(1) for life insurance, the lesser of the average interest rate for a period of 36 months and the average interest rate for a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average§Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;

(2) for a single premium immediate annuity and for an annuity benefit involving a life contingency arising from another annuity with a cash settlement option and a guaranteed interest contract with a cash settlement option, the average interest rate for a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average§Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;

(3) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as provided in (2) of this subsection, with a guarantee duration in excess of 10 years, the lesser of the average interest rate for a period of 36 months and the average interest rate for a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average§Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;

(4) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as provided in (2) of this subsection, with a guarantee duration of 10 years or less, the average interest rate for a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average§Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;

(5) for other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average interest rate for a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average§Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;

(6) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as provided in (2) of this subsection, the average interest rate for a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average§Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.

(k) In the event that Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average§Monthly Average Corporates is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or in the event that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average§Monthly Average Corporates as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate, which is adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by regulation adopted by the director, may be substituted.

(l) If a plan of life insurance that provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or if a plan of life insurance or annuity is of a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in (b)(2), (4), and (7) of this section, the reserves that are held shall be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan, and be computed by a method that is consistent with the principles of this Standard Valuation Law, as determined by regulations adopted by the director.

(m) A life insurer doing business in the state shall annually submit to the director an opinion of a qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items held in support of a policy or contract are computed appropriately, are based on assumptions that satisfy contractual provisions, are consistent with prior reported amounts, and comply with the applicable laws of this state.

(n) The actuarial opinion must

(1) be submitted with the annual statement reflecting the valuation of the reserve liabilities;

###### Sec. 21.22.030.   Hearing, findings, and approval.

(a) The director shall approve a merger or other acquisition of control referred to in AS 21.22.010 unless, after a public hearing, the director finds that

(1) after the change of control, the domestic insurer referred to in AS 21.22.010 would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed;

(2) the effect of the merger or other acquisitions of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly in this state;

(3) the financial condition of an acquiring party is such that it might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer or prejudice the interest of its policyholders or the interests of any remaining securityholders who are unaffiliated with the acquiring party;

(5) the plans or proposals that the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest;

(6) the competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control; or

(7) the acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance-buying public.

(b) The public hearing referred to in (a) of this section must be held within 60 days after the statement required by AS 21.22.010 is filed and determined to be complete by the director. The director shall give notice of at least 20 days of the hearing to the person filing the statement. The person filing the statement shall give notice of at least seven days of the hearing to the insurer and to other persons as may be designated by the director.

That person shall file the statement referred to in AS 21.22.010 with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners within five days after making the request for a public hearing. The director may opt out of a consolidated hearing and shall provide notice to the applicant of the opt-out within 10 days after receipt of the statement referred to in AS 21.22.010. A hearing conducted on a consolidated basis must be public and must be held within the United States before the insurance regulators of the states in which the insurers are domiciled. The director may attend the hearing in person or telephonically.

###### Sec. 21.22.040.   Mailings to shareholders and expenses.

All statements, amendments, or other material filed under AS 21.22.010, and all notices of public hearings held under AS 21.22.030, shall be mailed by the insurer to its shareholders within five business days after the insurer has received those statements, amendments, other materials, or notices.

A disclaimer of affiliation is considered granted unless the director, within 30 days after receipt of a complete disclaimer, notifies the disclaiming party that the disclaimer is disallowed. If the disclaimer is disallowed, the disclaiming party may request a hearing under AS 21.06.180§21.06.240.

###### Sec. 21.22.065.   Acquisitions involving change of control.

(a) Unless exempted in (j) of this section, this section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in this state.

(b) If an acquisition violates the standards established in (d) and (f) of this section, the director may enter an order requiring an involved insurer to cease doing business in this state with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation or denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in this state. Within 30 days of the issuance of the order, the involved insurer may submit a plan to remedy the anticompetitive effect of the acquisition within a reasonable time. Based upon a plan or other information submitted, the director shall specify the conditions, if any, under a time period during which the aspects of the acquisition causing a violation of the standards of this section would be remedied and the order vacated or modified. The order is stayed by the insurer's submission of a plan and shall be rescinded if the acquisition is not consummated.

(c) An acquisition that meets the requirements under (a) of this section is subject to an order under (b) of this section unless the acquiring person files a preacquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The person to be acquired may file a preacquisition notification. A preacquisition notification by a person to be acquired may not be filed in place of a preacquisition filing by an acquiring person. The preacquisition notification

(1) must be in a form and contain the information prescribed in regulations adopted by the director relating to insurance markets that, under (j)(5) of this section, cause the acquisition not to be exempt from the provisions of this section; the director may require additional material and information the director considers necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive standards of this section;

(2) may include an opinion of an economist regarding the competitive effect of the acquisition in this state accompanied by a summary of the education and experience indicating the economist's ability to render an informed opinion; and

(3) must be followed by a waiting period beginning on the date of receipt by the director of a preacquisition notification and ending on the earlier of the 30th day after the date of receipt or termination of the waiting period by the director unless, before the end of the waiting period, the director requires the submission of additional information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period shall end on the 30th day after receipt of the additional information by the director or termination of the waiting period by the director, whichever is earlier.

(d) The director may enter an order under (b) of this section regarding an acquisition if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with (c) of this section or if there is substantial evidence that the acquisition may substantially lessen competition, create a monopoly in a line of insurance in this state or significantly increase an insurer's market concentration. In determining whether an acquisition violates competitive standards under this subsection, the director shall consider the following:

(1) an acquisition covered under (a) of this section involving two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of a violation of the competitive standards

(A) if the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:

Insurer AInsurer B

4 percent4 percent or more

10 percent2 percent or more

15 percent1 percent or more;

(B) if the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:

Insurer AInsurer B

5 percent5 percent or more

10 percent4 percent or more

15 percent3 percent or more

19 percent1 percent or more.

(2) an acquisition covered under (a) of this section involving two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard if

(A) there is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market, which occurs when the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the two largest to the eighth largest, has increased by seven percent or more of the market over a period extending from any base year five to 10 years before the acquisition up to the date of the acquisition;

(B) one of the insurers involved is an insurer in a grouping of large insurers showing the requisite increase in market share; and

(C) another involved insurer's market share is two percent or more.

(e) A percentage not shown in the tables contained in (d) of this section may be interpolated proportionately to the percentage that is shown. The insurer with the largest share of the market shall be considered Insurer A. If more than two insurers are involved, a market share that exceeds the total of the two columns in the table by the insurers involved is prima facie evidence of a violation of the competitive standards contained in (d) of this section.

(f) Even though an acquisition does not violate the competitive standard under (d) of this section, the director may establish the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Even though an acquisition does violate the competitive standard under (d) of this section, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Relevant factors in making a determination under (d) of this section include market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry, and ease of entry into and exit out of the market. The burden of showing substantial evidence of a violation of the competitive standards rests with the director.

(g) An order may not be entered under (b) of this section if

(1) the acquisition will yield substantial economy of scale or economy in resource utilization that cannot be achieved in another way and the public benefits that would arise from the economy exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition; or

(2) the acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance and the public benefits of the increase exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition.

(h) A person who violates a cease and desist order of the director under (b) of this section may, after hearing and on order of the director, be subject to the suspension or revocation of a license, a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each day of violation, or both.

(i) An insurer or other person who fails to make a preacquisition filing required by (c) of this section and who also fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with filing requirements shall be subject to a fine of not more than $50,000.

(j) This section does not apply to

(1) an acquisition subject to approval or disapproval by the director under AS 21.22.010;

(2) a purchase of securities solely for investment purposes if the securities are not used by voting or otherwise to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of competition in an insurance market in this state; if a purchase of securities for investment purposes results in a presumption of control under AS 21.22.200(3), it is not solely for investment purposes unless the insurance supervisory official of the insurer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and the disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary insurance supervisory official to the director;

(3) the acquisition of a person by another person resulting in a change of control of an insurer when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance if preacquisition notification is filed with the director under (c) of this section 30 days before the proposed effective date of the acquisition; however, the preacquisition notification is not required for exclusion if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded under this subsection;

(4) the acquisition of an already affiliated person;

(5) an acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition,

(A) the combined market share of the involved insurers would not exceed five percent of a market;

(B) there would not be an increase in a market share of the larger writer; or

(C) the combined market share of the involved insurers would not exceed 12 percent of a market and the market share of the larger writer would not increase by more than two percent of a market;

(6) an acquisition for which a preacquisition notification would be required under this section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business; or

(7) an acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary supervisory insurance official affirmatively finds that the insurer is in a failing condition, there are no feasible alternatives to improving this condition, the public benefits of improving the insurer's condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition, and these findings are communicated by the domiciliary supervisory insurance official to this state's director.

(k) AS 21.22.150, 21.22.160, and 21.22.180 do not apply to acquisitions covered under this section.

###### Sec. 21.22.070.   Review by director.

If at any time the director determines that any material transaction entered into between an insurer and any of its affiliates does not meet the standards set out in AS 21.22.080, the director may, after hearings conducted in accordance with AS 21.06, require the insurer and the affiliate to terminate, set aside, or modify the transaction as considered appropriate by the director to make the transaction conform to those standards.  An insurer may submit a proposed material transaction to the director for review and the director may issue an opinion that the transaction meets the standard set out in AS 21.22.080.  The opinion creates a rebuttable presumption that neither the insurer, director, officer, employee, nor agent committed a wilful violation of this chapter by entering into the transaction.  The opinion does not prohibit the director from subsequently exercising authority under this section.

###### Sec. 21.22.080.   Transactions within an insurance holding company system.

Material transactions by registered insurers with their affiliates are subject to the following standards:

(1) the terms shall be fair and reasonable;

(2) charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;

(3) expenses incurred and payment received shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with customary insurance accounting practices consistently applied;

(4) the books, accounts, and records of each party to the transactions shall be maintained so as to disclose clearly and accurately the nature and details of the transactions including accounting information that is necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees to the respective parties;

(5) the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates or performance under a material transaction with an affiliate shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs; and

(6) agreements for cost-sharing services and management must include the provisions required by regulations adopted by the director.

###### Sec. 21.22.085.   Transactions involving a domestic insurer requiring director review.

(a) Transactions involving a domestic insurer and a person in its insurance holding company system, including amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed under AS 21.22.080 that are subject to a materiality standard in (1)§(7) of this subsection, may not be entered into unless the insurer has notified the director in writing of the insurer's intention to enter into the transaction at least 30 days before the transaction, or a shorter period if allowed by the director, and the director has not disapproved the transaction within the required notice period. The notice of amendments or modifications must include the reasons for the change and the financial effect on the domestic insurer. A domestic insurer shall provide to the director notice, within 30 days after a termination of a previously filed agreement, for determination of the type of filing required, if any. The requirements in this section apply to the following transactions:

(1) a sale, purchase, exchange, loan or extension of credit, or investment, provided the transaction is equal to or exceeds

(A) with respect to insurers other than life insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurer's admitted assets or 25 percent of surplus that pertains to policyholders, as of December 31 of the previous calendar year; or

(B) with respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets as of December 31 of the previous calendar year;

(2) a loan or extension of credit to a person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of the transaction, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make a loan or extension of credit to, purchase an asset of, or make an investment in an affiliate of the insurer making the loan or extension of credit, provided the transaction is equal to or exceeds

(A) with respect to insurers other than life insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurer's admitted assets or 25 percent of surplus that pertains to policyholder surplus, as of December 31 of the previous calendar year; or

(B) with respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets as of December 31 of the previous calendar year;

(3) a reinsurance agreement or modification, including

(A) a reinsurance pooling agreement;

(B) an agreement in which the reinsurance premium or change in the insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the three years after entering into the agreement or modification, equals or exceeds five percent of surplus that pertains to policyholders as of December 31 of the previous calendar year, including an agreement that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a nonaffiliate if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and nonaffiliate that a portion of the assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurer;

(4) a management agreement, service contract, tax allocation agreement, guarantee, or cost-sharing arrangement;

(5) a material transaction specified by regulation that the director determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders;

(6) a guarantee if made by a domestic insurer, except that a guarantee that is quantifiable as to amount is not subject to the notice requirements of this subsection unless it exceeds the lesser of one-half of one percent of the insurer's admitted assets or 10 percent of surplus that pertains to policyholders as of December 31 of the previous calendar year; a guarantee that is not quantifiable as to amount is subject to the notice requirements of this subsection; and

(7) a direct or an indirect acquisition or investment in a person that controls an insurer or in an affiliate of the insurer in an amount that, together with the person's present holdings in the investment, exceeds two and one-half percent of surplus that pertains to policyholders; direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in subsidiaries authorized under this title or regulations adopted by the director or in nonsubsidiary insurance affiliates that are subject to the provisions of this chapter are exempt from this requirement.

(b) Nothing in (a) of this section authorizes or permits a transaction that, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same holding company system, would violate a provision of law.

(c) A domestic insurer may not enter into a transaction that is part of a plan or series of similar transactions with persons within the holding company system if the purpose of the separate transaction is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and avoid review that would otherwise occur. If the director determines that this separate transaction is entered into over a 12-month period for this purpose, the director may impose penalties under AS 21.22.065(i), 21.22.170, AS 21.36.360(a), and 21.36.910.

(d) The director, in reviewing a transaction under this section, shall consider whether the transaction complies with the standards provided in AS 21.22.080 and whether the transaction may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.

(e) A domestic insurer shall notify the director within 30 days of an investment of a domestic insurer in a corporation if, after the investment, the total investment by the insurance holding company system in a corporation exceeds 10 percent of the corporation's voting securities.

###### Sec. 21.22.090.   Adequacy of surplus.

For the purposes of this chapter, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:

(1) the size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria;

(2) the extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the several lines of insurance;

(3) the number and size of risks insured in each line of business;

(4) the extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risk;

(5) the nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;

(6) the quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio;

(7) the recent past and projected future trend in the value of the insurer's investments;

(8) the surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;

(9) the adequacy of the insurer's reserves; and

(10) the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates made under AS 21.21; the director may treat any such investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever the director determines the investment warrants it.

###### Sec. 21.22.100.   Dividends and other distributions.

(a) A domestic insurer may not pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until

(1) 30 days after the director has received notice of the declaration of the dividend or distribution and has not within that period disapproved its payment; or

(2) the director has approved its payment within the 30-day period.

(b) For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes a dividend or distribution of cash or other property, the fair market value of which together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the lesser of (1) 10 percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the preceding year; or (2) the net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurer, or the net investment income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, for the 12-month period ending December 31 of the preceding year; but does not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. The carry forward provision shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.

(c) Notwithstanding AS 21.69.490, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution that is conditional upon the director's approval.  A declaration confers no rights upon shareholders until

(1) the director has approved the payment of the dividend or distribution; or

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another regulatory official is acting as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group, the director shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group-wide supervisor. However, the director shall make a determination or acknowledgment of the appropriate group-wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group under (b) of this section in the event of a material change in the internationally active insurance group that results in

(1) the internationally active insurance group's insurers domiciled in this state holding the largest share of the group's premiums, assets, or liabilities; or

(2) this state being the place of domicile of the top-tiered insurer or insurers in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group.

(d) Under AS 21.22.110, the director may collect from an insurer registered under AS 21.22.060 the information necessary to determine whether the director may act as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or if the director may acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the group-wide supervisor. Before issuing a determination that an internationally active insurance group is subject to group-wide supervision, the director shall notify the insurer registered under AS 21.22.060 and the ultimate controlling person within the internationally active insurance group. Upon notification, the internationally active insurance group has a minimum of 30 days to provide the director with additional information pertinent to the pending determination. The director may publish on the division's Internet website the identity of internationally active insurance groups that the director has determined are subject to group-wide supervision by the director.

(e) If the director is the group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group, the director may

(1) assess the enterprise risks in the internationally active insurance group to ensure

(A) the material financial condition and liquidity risks to members of the internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified by management; and

(B) reasonable and effective mitigation measures are in place;

(2) request from a member of an internationally active insurance group subject to the director's supervision information necessary and appropriate to assess enterprise risk, including information about the members of the internationally active insurance group regarding

(A) governance, risk assessment, and management;

(B) capital adequacy; and

(C) material intercompany transactions;

(3) coordinate and, through the authority of the regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, compel development and implementation of reasonable measures designed to ensure that the internationally active insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate enterprise risks to members of the internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance;

(4) communicate with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members in the internationally active insurance group and share relevant information subject to the confidentiality provisions under AS 21.22.120, through supervisory colleges under AS 21.22.115 or otherwise;

(5) enter into agreements with, or obtain documentation from, an insurer registered under AS 21.22.060, a member of the internationally active insurance group, or a state, federal, or international regulatory agency for members of the internationally active insurance group, providing the basis for, or otherwise clarifying, the director's role as group-wide supervisor, including provisions for resolving disputes with other regulatory officials; the agreements or documentation may not serve as evidence in a proceeding against an insurer or person in an insurance holding company system not domiciled or incorporated in this state or doing business in this state or otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this state; and

(6) perform other group-wide supervision activities, consistent with the authorities and purposes set out in this subsection.

(f) If the director acknowledges that another regulatory official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is the group-wide supervisor, the director may reasonably cooperate, through supervisory colleges or otherwise, with group-wide supervision undertaken by the group-wide supervisor under the following conditions:

(1) the director's cooperation is in compliance with the laws of this state; and

(2) the regulatory official acknowledged as the group-wide supervisor recognizes and cooperates with the director's activities as a group-wide supervisor for other internationally active insurance groups, where applicable; if recognition and cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the director may refuse recognition and cooperation.

(g) The director may enter into agreements with, or obtain documentation from, an insurer registered under AS 21.22.060, an affiliate of the insurer, or other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group, that provide the basis for, or otherwise clarify, a regulatory official's role as group-wide supervisor.

(h) A registered insurer subject to this section is liable for and shall pay the reasonable expenses of the director's participation in the administration of this section, including the engagement of attorneys, actuaries, and other professionals, and all reasonable travel expenses.

(1) if a policy covers more than one classification,

(A) for any portion of the coverage identified by a classification on the allocation schedule, the tax shall be computed by using the allocation schedule for the corresponding portion of the premium;

(B) for any portion of the coverage not identified by a classification on the allocation schedule, the tax shall be computed by using an alternative equitable method of allocation for the property or subject;

(C) for any portion of the coverage where the premium is indivisible, the tax shall be computed by using the method of allocation that pertains to the classification describing the predominant coverage.

###### Sec. 21.34.180.   Surplus lines tax.

(a) In addition to collecting the full amount of gross premiums written by an insurer for surplus lines insurance, the surplus lines broker shall collect and pay to the director a tax of 2.7 percent on the net premium, which is the total gross premiums written, less any return premiums, for the insurance. Where the home state of the insured is this state and the insurance covers properties, risks, or exposures located or to be performed both in and out of this state, the tax payable shall be computed based on an amount equal to 2.7 percent on that portion of the net premiums allocated under (f) of this section to this state, plus an amount equal to the portion of the premiums allocated under (f) of this section to other states or territories based on the tax rates and fees applicable to other properties, risks, or exposures located or to be performed outside of this state.

(b) The surplus lines broker may not absorb the tax or any part of it and may not rebate, for any reason, any part of the tax.

(c) If, under AS 21.09.210, an admitted insurer is required to collect and pay premium tax on a portion of a subscription policy, the surplus lines broker is not required to collect any amount that would constitute double taxation of that portion of the insurance.

(d) The director may participate in an agreement with another state formed for the purpose of collecting and disbursing to a remitting state any funds collected under (a) of this section applicable to other properties, risks, or exposures located or to be performed outside of this state.

(e) At the time of filing the quarterly report as set out in AS 21.34.170, each surplus lines broker shall pay the premium tax due for transactions occurring during the period covered by the report. The tax must be paid by electronic or other means as specified by the director.

(f) In determining the amount of premiums taxable in this state, all premiums written, procured, or received in this state shall be considered written on properties, risks, or exposures located or to be performed in this state except premiums that are properly allocated or apportioned and reported as taxable premiums of a remitting state. Allocation of the amount of premiums taxable for surplus lines insurance covering properties, risks, or exposures only partially located or to be performed in this state shall be determined by reference to an allocation schedule established by regulation adopted by the director subject to the following:

(1) if a policy covers more than one classification, the following apply:

(A) for any portion of the coverage identified by a classification on the allocation schedule, the tax shall be computed by using the allocation schedule for the corresponding portion of the premium;

(B) for any portion of the coverage not identified by a classification on the allocation schedule, the tax shall be computed by using an alternative equitable method of allocation for the property or risk;

(C) for any portion of the coverage where the premium is indivisible, the tax shall be computed by using the method of allocation that pertains to the classification describing the predominant coverage;

(2) if the information provided by the surplus lines broker is insufficient to substantiate the method of allocation used by the surplus lines broker, or if the director determines that the broker's method is incorrect, the director shall determine the equitable and appropriate amount of tax due to this state as follows:

(A) by use of the allocation schedule if the risk is appropriately identified in the schedule;

(B) if the allocation schedule does not identify a classification appropriate to the coverage, the director may give significant weight to documented evidence of the underwriting bases and other rating criteria used by the insurer; the director may also consider other available information to the extent sufficient and relevant, including the percentage of the insured's physical assets in this state, the percentage of the insured's sales in this state, the percentage of income or resources derived from this state, and the amount of premium tax paid to another jurisdiction for the policy.

(g) If the amount of tax due under (a) of this section is less than $50 in any jurisdiction, the tax must be paid in the jurisdiction in which the reports and summary of exported business are filed.

(h) The director shall, at least annually, furnish to the commissioner of a remitting state a copy of all filings reporting an allocation of taxes required by this section.

(i) This section does not apply to insurance of risks of state government or its political subdivisions, to an agency of state government or its political subdivisions, or to insurance of aircraft primarily engaged in interstate or foreign commerce.

(j) A surplus lines broker shall pay to the division a late payment fee of $50 a month plus five percent of the tax due each calendar month or part of a month during which the broker fails to pay the full amount of the tax or a portion of the tax and interest at the rate of one percent of the tax due each calendar month or part of a month for the period the broker fails to pay the tax. The late payment fee, not including interest, may not exceed $250 plus 25 percent of the tax due. The tax payment shall be made in the form required by the director, or a penalty shall be added to the tax equal to 25 percent of the tax due, not to exceed $2,000, with a minimum penalty of $100. In addition to any other penalty provided by law, if the provisions of this section are wilfully violated, a civil penalty may be assessed of not more than $10,000.

The disclosure required under this subsection shall be in writing or in the same medium as the application for insurance or the notice of renewal. Use of the following statement constitutes compliance with this subsection: "In connection with this application for insurance or notice of renewal, we will review your credit report or obtain or use a credit-based insurance score based on the information contained in your credit report. We may use this information to decide whether to insure you or how much to charge." If an insurer uses a third party to calculate the consumer's insurance score, the disclosure required under this subsection must also contain language similar to: "We may use a third party in connection with the development of your insurance score."

(b) An insurer that takes adverse action involving personal insurance against a consumer based in whole or in part on credit history or insurance score shall provide notice of the adverse action, in writing, to the consumer. The notice must

(B)  how the consumer may request an exception from the insurer; and

(C)  that, for a request for an exception to be considered by the insurer, the consumer must submit the request to the insurer not later than 60 days after receiving the notice under this subsection.

(c) An insurer may use a consumer's credit history or insurance score to cancel, deny, nonrenew, underwrite, or rate personal insurance only in combination with other substantive underwriting factors. If an insurer uses a consumer's credit history or insurance score, not later than 24 months after the insurer most recently used the consumer's credit history or insurance score to underwrite or rate a policy, the insurer shall reunderwrite and rerate the policy based on the consumer's current

(1)  credit history or insurance score and current risk characteristics; or

(2)  risk characteristics but not including, in whole or in part, the consumer's credit history or insurance score; for the purposes of this subsection,

(A) refusal to offer personal insurance coverage to a consumer constitutes denial of personal insurance; and

(B) an offer of placement with an affiliate insurer does not constitute denial of coverage.

(d) An insurer may not

(1) cancel, deny, nonrenew, underwrite, or rate personal insurance coverage based in whole or in part on

(A) the absence of credit history or the inability to determine the consumer's credit history if the insurer has received accurate and complete information from the consumer; this subparagraph does not apply if the insurer treats the consumer as if the consumer had neutral credit information as approved by the director;

(B) credit inquiries not initiated by the consumer;

(C) credit inquiries relating to insurance coverage if identified on a consumer's credit report;

(D) credit inquiries by the consumer for the consumer's own credit information;

(G) the consumer's use of a particular type of credit card, charge card, or debit card or the absence of a credit card;

(H) the consumer's total available line of credit; however, the consumer's ratio of debt to total available line of credit may be considered;

(I) the age of the most recent automobile or home loan obtained by the consumer; however, an insurer may consider the bill payment history or total number of loans; or

(J) the person's age when credit is established;

(2) use the credit history of the consumer when the consumer is adversely affected by a joint account owner who was the spouse of the consumer or a joint account owner who is the spouse of the consumer and who is a party to a divorce or dissolution action against the consumer; this paragraph applies only if the consumer provides written notice to the insurer that identifies the credit information that is adversely affected by the joint account owner; this paragraph does not prevent the use of credit history that is not identified by the consumer as required by this paragraph;

(3) use an insurance score that is calculated using the income, age, sex, address, zip code, census block, ethnic group, religion, marital status, or nationality of the consumer as a factor;

(4) use credit history to cancel, deny, nonrenew, underwrite, or rate a personal insurance policy if the history is obtained more than 90 days before the policy is cancelled, denied, nonrenewed, underwritten, or rated; this paragraph does not require an insurer to reevaluate a consumer's credit history more frequently than is required under (c) of this section;

(5) use an insurance score derived from an insurance scoring model to determine eligibility for an insurance payment plan; this paragraph does not prohibit the use of credit history to evaluate the ability of the consumer to make payments.

(e) If incorrect credit history is used to underwrite or rate personal insurance coverage and a consumer is charged higher premiums or offered less favorable policy terms due to the disputed credit history, the insurer shall reissue or rerate the policy retroactive to the effective date of the current policy term, and the policy, as reissued or rerated, shall provide premiums and policy terms the consumer would have been eligible for if accurate credit history had been used to underwrite or rate the policy. If an insurer determines that the insured has overpaid a premium, the insurer shall refund to the insured the amount of overpayment calculated back to the last 12 months of coverage or the actual policy period, whichever period is shorter. This subsection applies only if the consumer discovers the incorrect credit history within 12 months after the policy is issued, resolves the dispute as described under (f) of this section or under the process in 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. (Fair Credit Reporting Act), and notifies the insurer in writing that the dispute has been resolved.

(f) If the use of disputed credit history results in denial or cancellation of personal insurance coverage, an insurer shall reunderwrite the coverage without the use of credit information as a factor. This subsection applies only if, within 10 days following denial or cancellation, the consumer provides a reconsideration certification to the insurer that sets forth any items of the credit history that are disputed and that indicates that the consumer has initiated the dispute resolution process in 15 U.S.C. 1681 (Fair Credit Reporting Act) by requesting a copy of the consumer's credit report. An insurer's reconsideration certification form

(1) is subject to filing and approval by the director under AS 21.42.120; and

(2) shall be provided by an insurer to the consumer at the time of denial or cancellation.

(g) This section does not require an insurer to use credit history for any purpose.

(h) An insurer shall indemnify, defend, and hold the insurer's producers harmless from all liability, fees, and costs arising out of or relating to the actions, errors, or omissions of an insurance producer who obtains or uses credit information or insurance scores for an insurer if the insurance producer follows the instructions of or procedures established by the insurer and complies with any applicable law or regulation. This subsection does not provide a consumer or other insured with a cause of action that does not exist in the absence of this subsection.

(j) An insurer who has submitted an application for a certificate of authority under AS 21.09.110 and a filing of policy forms under AS 21.42.120 may file a proposed rating system as described in this section. The director's approval of the rating system is contingent upon the issuance of a certificate of authority under AS 21.09.120.

(k) The director

(1) may adopt regulations detailing the format and content of a rating system filing under this section;

(2) shall adopt regulations consistent with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Property and Casualty Model Rate and Policy Form Act, including those provisions relating to the format and content of informational filings for rates for commercial insurance; the provisions of AS 21.39.030(a) apply to an informational filing authorized by the director; in this paragraph, "informational filing" means a filing that the director does not approve before its use and that meets the format and content requirements of regulations adopted by the director.

(f) If, within the review period provided for in (a) of this section, the director finds that a filing does not meet the requirements of this title, the director shall send to the insurer or rating organization that made the filing written notice of disapproval of the filing specifying in what respects the filing fails to meet the requirements of this title and stating that the filing may not become effective.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a rate filing for workers' compensation insurance that classifies a risk in the construction industry may not contain or impose a higher premium rate if the risk upon which the higher rate filing is based consists only of a higher wage rate paid by the employer.

(b) The director shall accept a rate filing for workers' compensation insurance if the filing includes a reasonable method of recognizing differences in rates of pay for the construction industry, and the method uses a credit scale that begins at an amount equal to the average weekly wage in this state for the construction industry as determined by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development.

###### Sec. 21.39.050.   Disapproval of filings.

(a) [Repealed,§12 ch 88 SLA 2005.]

(b) If, within 30 days after a specific inland marine rate on a risk especially rated by a rating organization subject to AS 21.39.040(e) has become effective or, if within 30 days after a special surety or guaranty filing subject to AS 21.39.040(e) has become effective, the director finds that the filing does not meet the requirements of this chapter, the director shall send to the rating organization or insurer that made the filing written notice of disapproval of the filing specifying in what respects the filing fails to meet the requirements of this chapter and stating when, within a reasonable period, the filing shall be considered no longer effective. Disapproval shall not affect a contract made or issued before the expiration of the period set out in the notice.

(c) If, at any time subsequent to the applicable review period provided for in AS 21.39.041(a) or 21.39.220(b), the director finds that a filing does not meet the requirements of this title, the director shall, after a hearing held upon not less than 10 days written notice specifying the matters to be considered at the hearing and given to each insurer and rating organization that made the filing, issue an order specifying in what respects the filing fails to meet the requirements of this title and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, the filing shall be considered no longer effective. Copies of the order shall be sent to each insurer and rating organization that made the filing. The order may not affect a contract or policy made or issued before the expiration of the period set out in the order.

(d) A person or organization aggrieved by a filing that is in effect may make written application to the director for a hearing, except that the insurer that made the filing may not be authorized to proceed under this subsection.  The application shall specify the grounds to be relied upon by the applicant and the application must show that the person or organization making the application has a specific economic interest affected by the filing.  If the director finds that the application is made in good faith, that the applicant has a specific economic interest, that the applicant would be so aggrieved if the grounds are established, and that the grounds otherwise justify holding a hearing, the director shall within 30 days after receipt of the application hold a hearing upon not less than 10 days written notice to the applicant and to every insurer and rating organization that made the filing.  A rating or advisory organization has status under this chapter to make application for a hearing on a filing made by an insurer with the director. If, after the hearing, the director finds that the filing does not meet the requirements of this chapter, the director shall issue an order specifying in what respects that the filing fails to meet the requirements of this chapter, and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, the filing shall be considered no longer effective.

###### Sec. 21.39.055.   Cancellation of approved filing.

###### Sec. 21.39.060.   Rating organizations.

(a) A corporation, an unincorporated association, a partnership, or a person, whether located inside or outside this state, may make application to the director for license as a rating organization for the kinds of insurance, or subdivision or class of risk or a part or combination thereof as are specified in its application and shall file with the application (1) a copy of its constitution, its articles of agreement or association, or its certificate of incorporation, and of its bylaws and regulations governing the conduct of its business; (2) a list of its members and subscribers; (3) the name and address of a resident of this state upon whom notices or orders of the director or process affecting the rating organization may be served; and (4) a statement of its qualifications as a rating organization. If the director finds that the applicant is competent, trustworthy, and otherwise qualified to act as a rating organization and that its constitution, articles of agreement or association or certificate of incorporation, and its bylaws and regulations governing the conduct of its business conform to the requirements of law, the director shall issue a license specifying the kinds of insurance, or subdivisions or classes or risks or parts or combinations of them for which the applicant is authorized to act as a rating organization. Each application shall be granted or denied in whole or in part by the director within 60 days after the date of its filing. Licenses issued under this section shall remain in effect for three years unless suspended or revoked by the director. The fee for the license is set under AS 21.06.250. Licenses issued under this section may be suspended or revoked by the director, after hearing upon notice, if the rating organization ceases to meet the requirements of this subsection and (b) of this section.

(c) Subject to regulations that have been approved by the director as reasonable, each rating organization shall permit an insurer that is not a member to be a subscriber to its rating services for the kind of insurance, subdivision, or class of risk or a part or combination of them for which it is authorized to act as a rating organization. Notice of proposed changes in the regulations shall be given to subscribers. Each rating organization shall furnish its rating service without discrimination to its members and subscribers. The reasonableness of a regulation in its application to subscribers, or the refusal of a rating organization to admit an insurer as a subscriber, shall, at the request of a subscriber or an insurer, be reviewed by the director at a hearing held upon at least 10 days' written notice to the rating organization and to the subscriber or insurer. If the director finds that the regulation is unreasonable in its application to subscribers, the director shall order that the regulation shall not be applicable to subscribers. If the rating organization fails to grant or reject an insurer's application for subscribership within 30 days after it was made, the insurer may request a review by the director as if the application had been rejected. If the director finds that the insurer has been refused admittance to the rating organization as a subscriber without justification, the director shall order the rating organization to admit the insurer as a subscriber. If the director finds that the action of the rating organization was justified, the director shall make an order affirming the action.

(d) A rating organization may not adopt a regulation that would prohibit or regulate the payment of dividends, savings, or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members, or subscribers.

(e) Cooperation among rating organizations or among rating organizations and insurers in rate making or other matters within the scope of this chapter is authorized.

(f) A rating organization may provide for the examination of policies, daily reports, binders, renewal certificates, endorsements, or other evidences of insurance, or the cancellation of them, and may make reasonable rules governing their submission. The rules must contain a provision that in the event an insurer does not within 60 days furnish satisfactory evidence to the rating organization of the correction of an error or omission previously called to its attention by the rating organization, it shall be the duty of the rating organization to notify the director. All information submitted for examination shall be confidential.

(g) A rating organization may subscribe for or purchase actuarial, technical, or other service. The services shall be available to all members and subscribers without discrimination.

###### Sec. 21.39.070.   Deviations.

(a) Each member of or subscriber to a rating organization shall adhere to the filings made on its behalf by the organization except that an insurer may file with the director, in accordance with AS 21.39.040(a), a deviation from the class rates, schedules, rating plans, or rules respecting a kind of insurance, or class of risk within a kind of insurance, or a combination of them.

(b) [Repealed,§12 ch 88 SLA 2005.]

###### Sec. 21.39.080.   Appeal by minority.

(b) If the appeal is based upon the failure of the rating organization to make a filing on behalf of the member or subscriber, that is based on a system of expense provisions that differs, in accordance with the right granted in AS 21.39.030(a)(3), from the system of expense provisions included in a filing made by the rating organization, the director shall, if the appeal is granted, order the rating organization to make the requested filing for use by the appellant.  In deciding the appeal the director shall apply the standards set out in AS 21.39.030.

###### Sec. 21.39.090.   Rights of insureds.

Each rating organization and each insurer that makes its own rate shall, within a reasonable time after receiving written request and upon payment of the reasonable charge as it may make, furnish to an insured affected by a rate made by it, or to the authorized representative of the insured, all pertinent information concerning the rate.  Each rating organization and each insurer that makes its own rates shall provide within this state reasonable means for a person aggrieved by the application of its rating system to be heard, in person or by an authorized representative, on a written request to review the manner in which the rating system has been applied in connection with the insurance.  If the rating organization or insurer fails to grant or reject the request within 30 days after it is made, the applicant may proceed in the same manner as if the application had been rejected.  A party affected by the action of the rating organization or the insurer on the request may, within 30 days after written notice of the action, appeal to the director, who, after a hearing held upon not less than 10 days written notice to the appellant and to the rating organization or insurer, may affirm or reverse the action.

###### Sec. 21.39.100.   Advisory organizations.

(a) Each group, association or other organization of insurers, whether located inside or outside this state, that assists insurers that make their own filings or rating organizations in rate making by the collection and furnishing of loss or expense statistics or by the submission of recommendations, but that does not make filings under this chapter, shall be known as an advisory organization.

(1) a copy of its constitution, its articles of agreement or association, or its certificate of incorporation and of its bylaws and regulations governing its activities;

(4) an agreement that the director may examine the advisory organization in accordance with AS 21.39.120.

(c) If, after a hearing, the director finds that the furnishing of the information or assistance involves an act or practice that is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with this chapter, the director may issue a written order specifying in what respects the act or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with this chapter, and requiring the discontinuance of the act or practice.

(d) An insurer that makes its own filings and a rating organization may not support its filings by statistics or adopt rate making recommendations, furnished to it by an advisory organization that has not complied with this section or with an order of the director involving the statistics or recommendations issued under (c) of this section.  If the director finds the insurer or rating organization to be in violation of this subsection the director may issue an order requiring the discontinuance of the violation.

###### Sec. 21.39.110.   Joint underwriting or joint reinsurance.

The reasonable costs of the examination shall be paid by the rating organization, advisory organization, or group, association, or other organization examined upon presentation to it of a detailed account of the costs. The officers, manager, agents, and employees of the rating organization, advisory organization, or group, association, or other organization may be examined at any time under oath and shall exhibit all books, records, accounts, documents, or agreements governing its method of operation.  In lieu of an examination the director may accept the report of an examination made by the insurance supervisory official of another state, under the laws of that state.

(b) A report of an examination may not be made public unless the rating organization, advisory organization, group, association, or other organization examined within 30 days after its receipt of the director's written notice of intention to publicize the report, does not apply to the director for a hearing.  If the application is made within the 30 days, the director shall hold a hearing, after first giving reasonable written notice of the time and place, and either approve or disapprove the report as being correct.  If the director approves the report or if no application is made for a hearing, the report shall immediately become and be admissible in evidence as a public record, and open to public inspection.

###### Sec. 21.39.130.   Rate administration.

(a) The director shall adopt reasonable regulations and statistical plans, reasonably adapted to each of the rating systems filed with the director, that may be modified and that shall be used by each insurer in the recording and reporting of its loss and countrywide expense experience, in order that the experience of all insurers may be made available at least annually in the form and detail that may be necessary to aid in determining whether rating systems comply with the standards set out in AS 21.39.030. The regulations and plans may also provide for the recording and reporting of expense experience items that are specially applicable to this state and are not susceptible of determination by a prorating of countrywide expense experience.  In adopting the regulations and plans, the director shall give due consideration to the rating systems filed with the director and, in order that the regulations and plans may be as uniform as is practicable among the several states, to the regulations and to the form of the plans used for the rating systems in other states.  An insurer may not be required to record or report its loss experience on a classification basis that is inconsistent with the rating system filed by it.  The director may designate one or more rating organizations or other agencies to assist in gathering the experience and making compilations.  The compilations shall be made available, subject to reasonable regulations adopted by the director, to insurers and rating organizations.

(b) Reasonable regulations and plans may be adopted by the director for the interchange of data necessary for the application of rating plans.

The insurers may agree among themselves on the use of reasonable rate modifications for the insurance. The agreements and rate modifications are subject to the approval of the director.

###### Sec. 21.39.155.   Assigned risk pool.

(a) The director may require insurers, except a reciprocal insurer formed under AS 21.75, as a condition of writing a line of insurance dealing with medical malpractice or workers' compensation, to participate in an assigned risk pool if the director finds that mandatory carrier participation is in the public interest.

(b) The assigned risk pool and the procedures to be followed in administering the pool shall be established by regulation.

(c) An insurer may impose a surcharge not to exceed 25 percent of the premium for assigned risk pool insurance, except that a surcharge may not be applied to the first $3,000 in premium in any policy year.

###### Sec. 21.39.160.   Penalties.

(a) If the director finds, following an appropriate hearing, that a person or organization has violated a provision of this chapter, the director may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $200 or the actual amount of gain, whichever is greater, for each violation, but if the director finds the violation to be wilful the director may impose a penalty of $2,000 or three times the actual amount of gain, whichever is greater, for each violation.  The penalties may be in addition to any other penalty provided by law.  In this section, "gain" means the difference between the amount actually charged and the amount that should have been charged under applicable filings of the person or organization.

(b) The director may suspend the license of a rating organization or insurer that fails to comply with an order of the director within the time limited by the order or an extension of time granted by the director.  The director may not suspend the license of a rating organization or insurer for failure to comply with an order until the time prescribed for an appeal has expired or, if an appeal has been taken, until the order has been affirmed.  The director may determine when a suspension of license becomes effective.  The suspension shall remain in effect for the period fixed by the director unless the director modifies or rescinds the suspension, or until the order upon which the suspension is based is modified, rescinded, or reversed.

(c) A penalty may not be imposed and a license may not be suspended or revoked except upon a written order of the director, stating findings, made after a hearing held upon not less than 10 days written notice to the person or organization specifying the alleged violation.

###### Sec. 21.39.170.   Hearing procedure and judicial review.

(a) An insurer or rating organization to which the director has issued an order made without a hearing may, within 30 days after notice to it of the order, make written request to the director for a hearing. The director shall hear the party or parties within 20 days after receipt of the request and shall give not less than 10 days written notice of the time and place of the hearing.  Within 15 days after the hearing the director shall affirm, reverse or modify the previous action, specifying the reasons.  Pending the hearing and decision the director may suspend or postpone the effective date of the previous action.

(b) Nothing contained in this chapter may require the observance at a hearing of formal rules of pleading or evidence.

(c) An order or decision of the director is subject to review by appeal to the superior court at the instance of a party in interest.  The court shall determine whether the filing of the appeal will operate as a stay of an order or decision of the director.

###### Sec. 21.39.210.   Flex-rating.

(a) Except for workers' compensation, medical malpractice, and assigned risk plan rates, an insurer's rate level increase or decrease may take effect without prior approval if the cumulative rate level change for all coverages combined, calculated from the effective date to 12 months before the effective date, is not greater than 10 percent.

(b) An insurer may make multiple rate filings under this provision during any 12-month period if the cumulative rate level change is within the specified limitation as described in (a) of this section. For an insurer adopting a rating organization prospective loss cost filing, the cumulative rate level change includes both the rating organization's prospective loss cost change as well as the insurer's loss cost adjustment change.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, for a policy governed by this section, a filing that produces a rate level change within the limitations provided in (a) of this section is effective without prior approval and may take effect on the date specified in the filing, but not earlier than the date it is received by the division.

The director may request additional supporting information if the director does not have enough information upon which to determine if the filing meets the requirements of this title.

(e) A filing submitted under (a) of this section is considered to comply with this title. However, if the director determines that the filing does not meet the requirements of this title, the director shall issue an order specifying in detail the specific statutes the insurer has violated and the reasons the filing is not in compliance. The order must state a reasonable future date on which the filing is to be considered no longer effective. An order by the director under this subsection is prospective and does not affect any contract issued or made before the effective date of the order.

(f) The director may adopt regulations implementing the provisions of this section.

(g) This section does not apply to rating organizations or to any impaired or insolvent insurer operating under a rehabilitation plan, an order of supervision, or an impaired financial condition as determined by the director.

(a) An insurer's rate level increase or decrease filing falling outside of the limitation provided in AS 21.39.210(a) is subject to file and use provisions under this section, unless the filing is otherwise exempt from those provisions under another provision in this chapter. A rate filing from a rating organization shall be submitted to the director under the file and use provisions. A rate filing from an insurer operating under a rehabilitation plan, an order of supervision, or an impaired financial condition as determined by the director shall be submitted to the division under the prior approval provisions. The insurer shall submit a filing for a new product or coverage introduction that does not have a rate on file under the file and use provisions.

(b) Each insurer shall file with the director all rates, supplementary rate information, and supporting information at least 30 days before the proposed effective date. The director shall review the filing within 15 days. This period may be extended by the director for an additional period not to exceed 15 days if the director gives written notice within the initial 15-day period to the insurer or rating organization that made the filing that states additional time for the consideration of the filing is required. The waiting period is the 30-day period following the date the director receives the filing.

(c) The filing must include the effective date that may not be before the end of the waiting period. Upon written application by the insurer or rating organization, the director may authorize a filing that the director has reviewed to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period.

(d) A filing shall be considered to meet the requirements of this chapter and to become effective unless disapproved by the director within the waiting period.

(e) The director shall disapprove a filing if the director finds that the filing does not meet the requirements of this title.

(f) If the insurer or rating organization is unable to provide information requested by the director under AS 21.39.040(d) within 30 days after the director's request, the response period may be extended by the director for an additional 15 days upon written application of the insurer or rating organization within the initial 30-day response period. The director may disapprove the filing for failure to provide the requested information during the response period. The disapproval notice must state a reasonable future date on which the filing is to be considered no longer effective.

(g) A filing and supporting information shall be open to public inspection after the director completes the review of the filing or after the filing becomes effective, whichever is later.

(h) If within the waiting period in (b) of this section, the director finds that a filing does not meet the requirements of this title, the director shall send to the insurer or rating organization that made the filing, written notice of disapproval of the filing specifying in what respects the filing fails to meet the requirements of this title and shall state a reasonable future date on which the filing is to be considered no longer effective.

(a) A person of competent legal capacity may procure or effect an insurance contract on the life or body of the person for the benefit of any person.  A person may not procure or cause to be procured an insurance contract upon the life or body of another person unless the benefits under the contract are payable to the individual insured, the personal representatives of the individual insured, or to a person having, at the time the contract was made, an insurable interest in the individual insured.

(b) If the beneficiary, assignee, or other payee under a contract made in violation of this section receives from the insurer any benefits from the contract upon the death, disablement, or injury of the person insured, the person insured or the executor or administrator of the person insured may maintain an action to recover the benefits from the person receiving them.

(c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, a charitable organization may obtain, by procurement, assignment, or otherwise, life or health insurance on an insured who consents to the issuance of the insurance.

(d) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, a trustee, acting in a fiduciary capacity, may procure or cause to be procured an insurance contract that is on the life or body of an individual and under which the proceeds of the insurance contract are payable to the trustee, acting in a fiduciary capacity, if

(2) on the date the contract is made, a settlor of the trust is the individual insured, has an insurable interest in the individual insured, or would have had an insurable interest in the individual insured if the settlor were living at the time the contract was made; in this paragraph, "settlor" means a person, including a person for whom a fiduciary or agent is acting, who executes the trust instrument; and

(3) the proceeds of the contract are primarily for the benefit of a trust beneficiary who has an insurable interest in the individual insured, except that, if the determination of the trust beneficiary's insurable interest is based on (e)(1) of this section, the trust beneficiary's relation by blood or law must be within the third degree.

(e) "Insurable interest," with reference to life, annuity, or health insurance, includes only the following interests:

(1) in the case of persons related closely by blood or by law, a substantial interest engendered by love and affection;

(2) in the case of persons other than those described in (1) of this subsection, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life, health, or bodily safety of the person insured continue, as distinguished from an interest that would arise only by, or would be enhanced in value by, the death, disablement, or injury of the individual insured;

(3) an individual party to a contract or option for the purchase or sale of an interest in a business partnership or firm, or of shares of stock of a closed corporation or of an interest in the shares, has an insurable interest in the life of each individual party to the contract for the purposes of the contract only, in addition to an insurable interest that may otherwise exist as to the life of the individual.

###### Sec. 21.42.040.   Interest of named insured.

###### Sec. 21.42.050.   Change of interest on death.

A change of interest, by will or succession, on the death of the insured does not avoid an insurance of property and the insurance passes to the person taking an interest in the thing insured.

###### Sec. 21.42.060.   Transfer of interest between joint insureds.

A transfer of interest by one of the several partners, joint owners, or owners in common, who are jointly insured, to the others, does not avoid an insurance of property even though it has been agreed that the insurance shall cease upon an alienation of the thing insured.

###### Sec. 21.42.070.   Insurance without interest, or of wager, is void.

(a) A stipulation in a policy of insurance of property for the payment of loss without regard to absence of an insurable interest in the property on the part of the insured, or that the policy shall be received as proof of the interest, is void.

(b) A policy executed by way of gaming or wagering is void.

(2) a person having an insurable interest in the life of a minor or a person upon whom a minor is dependent for support and maintenance, may effectuate insurance upon the life of or pertaining to the minor;

###### Sec. 21.42.100.   Request for copy of application; alteration.

In the case of a request from a beneficiary, the time within which the insurer is required to furnish a copy of the application does not begin to run until after receipt of evidence satisfactory to the insurer of the beneficiary's vested interest in the policy or contract.

(b) An alteration of a written application for a life or health insurance policy may not be made by a person other than the applicant without the written consent of the applicant, except that insertions may be made by the insurer, for administrative purposes only, in a manner that indicates clearly that the insertions are not to be ascribed to the applicant.

###### Sec. 21.42.110.   Representations in applications.

All statements and descriptions in an application for an insurance policy or annuity contract, or in negotiations for the policy or contract, by or in behalf of the insured or annuitant, shall be considered to be representations and not warranties. Misrepresentations, omissions, concealment of facts, and incorrect statements may not prevent a recovery under the policy or contract unless either

(1) fraudulent;

(2) material either to the acceptance of the risk, or to the hazard assumed by the insurer; or

(3) the insurer in good faith would either not have issued the policy or contract, or would not have issued a policy or contract in as large an amount, or at the same premium or rate, or would not have provided coverage with respect to the hazard resulting in the loss, if the true facts had been made known to the insurer as required either by the application for the policy or contract or otherwise.

###### Sec. 21.42.120.   Filing, approval of forms.

(a) A basic insurance policy or annuity contract form, or application form where written application is required and is to be made a part of the policy or contract, or printed rider or endorsement form or form of renewal certificate, may not be delivered, or issued for delivery in this state, unless the form has been filed with and approved by the director. This provision does not apply to surety bonds or to specially rated inland marine risks, nor to policies, riders, endorsements, or forms of unique character designed for and used with relation to insurance upon a particular subject, or that relate to the manner of distribution of benefits or to the reservation of rights and benefits under life or health insurance policies and are used at the request of the individual policyholder, contract holder, or certificate holder; or to policies of commercial insurance that the director has authorized under (d) of this section to be filed on or before the date of use and that are not subject to the prior approval of the director. The filing required by this section of forms for use in property, marine other than wet marine and transportation coverages, casualty, and surety coverages may be made by a rating organization on behalf of its members and subscribers; but this provision does not prohibit a member or subscriber from filing the forms on its own behalf.

(b) Each insurer or rating organization shall submit a filing under one of the following procedures, clearly specifying the filing procedure under which the filing is being made:

(1) for prior approval under AS 21.42.123; or

(2) for file and use under AS 21.42.125.

(c) An order of the director disapproving the form or withdrawing a previous approval shall state the grounds and the particulars in such detail as reasonably to inform the insurer thereof.

(d) The director may, by order, require that a form or document be filed for informational purposes or may exempt a form or document from the requirements of this section for a time determined by the director when, in the opinion of the director, this section may not practicably be applied, or the filing or approval of the form or document is, in the opinion of the director, not desirable or necessary for the protection of the public.

(e) This section applies to a form used by domestic insurers for delivery in a jurisdiction outside this state, if the insurance supervisory official of that jurisdiction informs the director that the form is not subject to approval or disapproval by the official, and upon the director's order requiring the form to be submitted for review and approval under this section.  The applicable same standards shall apply to these forms as apply to forms for domestic use.

(f) This section does not apply to a type of insurance subject to AS 21.57 or to policies issued under AS 21.34.

(g) An insurer who has submitted an application for a certificate of authority under AS 21.09.110 may file a proposed policy form as described in this section. The director's approval of the policy form is contingent upon the issuance of a certificate of authority under AS 21.09.120.

(h) The director may adopt regulations detailing the format and content of the filing of a policy form under this section.

(i) The director may by order require an insurance document, form, or type of insurance document or form as specified in the order, to be submitted for prior approval if, in the opinion of the director, the approval of the insurance document, form, or type of insurance document or form is necessary for the protection of the public.

###### Sec. 21.42.123.   Form filing subject to prior approval.

(a) A prior approval filing shall be made not less than 30 days before the effective date. At the end of the 30-day period, the form filed shall be considered approved unless, before the end of the 30-day period, it has been affirmatively disapproved by the director. Approval of the form by the director before the end of the 30-day period constitutes a waiver of the unexpired portion of the waiting period. The director may extend by not more than an additional 30 days the period for approving or disapproving the form, by giving notice of the extension during the initial 30-day period. At the expiration of the extended period, and in the absence of a prior approval or disapproval, the form shall be considered approved. The director may, by order, at any time after the notice, and for cause shown, withdraw the approval.

(b) The director may require the insurer or rating organization to revise the filing to comply with this title. Failure of the insurer or rating organization to provide the information within 30 days after the director's request, or an extension of the period by the director for an additional 15 days upon written request of the insurer or rating organization within the response period, is considered to be a request by the insurer or rating organization to withdraw the filing from further consideration.

(c) The filing must state an effective date. In place of a specific date, the insurer or rating organization may specify a reasonable time period after approval for the filing to be effective.

(d) A prior approval filing shall be open to public inspection after the filing becomes effective.

###### Sec. 21.42.125.   Form filing subject to file and use; penalties.

(a) A file and use filing shall be filed with the director for a waiting period of not less than 30 days. The period may be extended by the director or the insurer or rating organization for an additional 30 days if notice is given within the initial 30-day period that additional time is needed for the consideration of the filing. The filing may become effective at the end of the waiting period unless disapproved by the director before the expiration of the waiting period.

(b) The filing must state an effective date that must be after the waiting period. Upon written notice by the insurer or rating organization, the director may authorize a filing that has been reviewed to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period.

(c) A file and use form filing must include a signed compliance certificate certifying that the filing complies with this title. An authorized officer or state filings manager of the insurer shall sign the compliance certificate stating that, to the best of the individual's knowledge, the filing complies with this title. The director may issue an order requiring an insurer who submits an incomplete or inaccurate compliance certificate to submit future form filings for prior approval. The order must specify the conditions under which the insurer may again submit filings under this section. In addition to any other penalty provided by law, a person that the director finds has submitted a materially false or misleading compliance certificate may be subject to either a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation or a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation if the director finds that the person knowingly violated the provisions of this title. A filing that does not include the signed compliance certificate shall be reviewed under the prior approval procedure under AS 21.42.123. In this subsection, "knowingly" has the meaning given in AS 11.81.900.

(d) The director may require an insurer or rating organization to provide additional information to demonstrate that a file and use filing meets the requirements of this title or to revise the filing to meet the requirements of this title. If an insurer or rating organization fails to provide the information within the waiting period described in (a) of this section, the director shall consider the failure to be a request to withdraw the filing from further consideration.

(e) A file and use filing shall be open to public inspection after the filing becomes effective.

###### Sec. 21.42.130.   Grounds for disapproval.

The director shall disapprove a form filed under AS 21.42.120 or withdraw a previous approval of the form only if the form

(1) is in any respect in violation of or does not comply with this title;

(2) contains or incorporates by reference, where incorporation is permissible, an inconsistent, ambiguous, or misleading clause, or exception and condition that deceptively affects the risk purported to be assumed in the general coverage of the contract;

(3) has a title, heading, or other indication of its provisions that is misleading;

(5) provides benefits for Medicare supplement insurance that are unreasonable in relation to the premium charged.

###### Sec. 21.42.140.   Standard provisions.

(a) Insurance contracts must contain the standard or uniform provisions that are required by the applicable provisions of this title pertaining to contracts of particular kinds of insurance.  The director may waive the required use of a particular provision in a particular insurance policy form on a determination that

(1) the provision is unnecessary for the protection of the insured and inconsistent with the purposes of the policy; and

(2) the policy is otherwise approved.

(b) A policy may not contain a provision inconsistent with a standard or uniform provision used or required to be used, but the director may approve a substitute provision that the director determines is not less favorable in any particular to the insured or beneficiary than the provisions otherwise required.

(c) In lieu of the provisions required by this title for contracts for particular kinds of insurance, substantially similar provisions required by the law of the domicile of a foreign or alien insurer may be used when approved by the director.

(d) A provision required by this title to be contained in a policy cannot be waived by agreement between the insurer and another person.

(c) For the purposes of this section,

(1) "attachment point" means the claim amount incurred by an insured group beyond which the insurer incurs a liability for payment;

(2) "expected claims" means the amount of claims that, in absence of a stop-loss insurance policy or other insurance, are projected to be incurred by an insured group through its health benefit plan;

The policy, when issued, shall contain the entire contract between the parties, and neither the insurer nor its agent or representative, nor a person insured by the policy, may make an agreement as to the insurance that is not expressed in the policy.

(c) Except as may be provided for reserves for guaranteed benefits and funds referred to in (d) of this section, amounts allocated to a separate account and accumulations to it may be invested and reinvested in securities eligible for investment for life insurance companies without regard to quantitative investment limitations prescribed by law for life insurance companies.

The Commission may meet in camera only after a majority of the entire membership votes to close a meeting en toto or in part. As soon as practicable, the Commission must make public (i) a copy of the vote to close the meeting revealing the vote of each Member with no proxy votes allowed, and (ii) votes taken during such meeting;

(v) Establishing the titles, duties and authority and reasonable procedures for the election of the officers of the Commission;

(vi) Providing reasonable standards and procedures for the establishment of the personnel policies and programs of the Commission.

(b) The Commission shall defend any Member, officer, executive director, employee or representative of the Commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining his or her own counsel; and provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from that person's intentional or willful and wanton misconduct.

(c) The Commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any Member, officer, executive director, employee or representative of the Commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, provided, that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of that person.

(1) The Commission shall meet and take such actions as are consistent with the provisions of this Compact and the Bylaws.

(2) Each Member of the Commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that Compacting State is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the Commission. A Member shall vote in person or by such other means as provided in the Bylaws. The Bylaws may provide for Members' participation in meetings by telephone or other means of communication.

(3) The Commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. Additional meetings shall be held as set forth in the Bylaws.

(1) Rulemaking Authority. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules, including Uniform Standards, and Operating Procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this Compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this Act, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.

(2) Rulemaking Procedure. Rules and Operating Procedures shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981 as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Commission. Before the Commission adopts a Uniform Standard, the Commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committee(s) in each Compacting State responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the Uniform Standard. The Commission in adopting a Uniform Standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.

(3) Effective Date and Opt Out of a Uniform Standard. A Uniform Standard shall become effective ninety (90) days after its promulgation by the Commission or such later date as the Commission may determine; provided, however, that a Compacting State may opt out of a Uniform Standard as provided in this Article. "Opt out" shall be defined as any action by a Compacting State to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated Uniform Standard. All other Rules and Operating Procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each Rule, Operating Procedure or amendment.

(4) Opt Out Procedure. A Compacting State may opt out of a Uniform Standard, either by legislation or regulation duly promulgated by the Insurance Department under the Compacting State's Administrative Procedure Act. If a Compacting State elects to opt out of a Uniform Standard by regulation, it must (a) give written notice to the Commission no later than ten (10) business days after the Uniform Standard is promulgated, or at the time the State becomes a Compacting State and (b) find that the Uniform Standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the State, given the conditions in the State. The Commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the State which warrant a departure from the Uniform Standard and determining that the Uniform Standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the State. The Commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the State and needs of the citizens of the State outweigh: (i) the intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the Products subject to this Act; and (ii) the presumption that a Uniform Standard adopted by the Commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Compacting State may, at the time of its enactment of this Compact, prospectively opt out of all Uniform Standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted Compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any State to participate in this Compact. Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this Compact by the Compacting State and shall apply to all existing Uniform Standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.

(5) Effect of Opt Out. If a Compacting State elects to opt out of a Uniform Standard, the Uniform Standard shall remain applicable in the Compacting State electing to opt out until such time the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective. Once the opt out of a Uniform Standard by a Compacting State becomes effective as provided under the laws of that State, the Uniform Standard shall have no further force and effect in that State unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of the State. If a Compacting State opts out of a Uniform Standard after the Uniform Standard has been made effective in that State, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under Article XIV for withdrawals.

(6) Stay of Uniform Standard. If a Compacting State has formally initiated the process of opting out of a Uniform Standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the Compacting State may petition the Commission, at least fifteen (15) days before the effective date of the Uniform Standard, to stay the effectiveness of the Uniform Standard in that State. The Commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the Commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety (90) days, unless affirmatively extended by the Commission; provided, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one (1) year unless the Compacting State can show extraordinary circumstances which warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal challenge which prevents the Compacting State from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the Commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.

(7) Not later than thirty (30) days after a Rule or Operating Procedure is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the Rule or Operating Procedure; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the Rule or Operating Procedure from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the Rule or Operating Procedure to be unlawful if the Rule or Operating Procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the Commission's authority.

(1) The Commission shall promulgate Rules establishing conditions and procedures for public inspection and copying of its information and official records, except such information and records involving the privacy of individuals and insurers' trade secrets. The Commission may promulgate additional Rules under which it may make available to federal and state agencies, including law enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.

(2) Except as to privileged records, data and information, the laws of any Compacting State pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any Compacting State Commissioner of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data or information to the Commission; provided, that disclosure to the Commission shall not be deemed to waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality requirement; and further provided, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, the Commission shall not be subject to the Compacting State's laws pertaining to confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to records, data and information in its possession. Confidential information of the Commission shall remain confidential after such information is provided to any Commissioner.

(3) The Commission shall monitor Compacting States for compliance with duly adopted Bylaws, Rules, including Uniform Standards, and Operating Procedures. The Commission shall notify any non-complying Compacting State in writing of its noncompliance with Commission Bylaws, Rules or Operating Procedures. If a noncomplying Compacting State fails to remedy its noncompliance within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the Compacting State shall be deemed to be in default as set forth in Article XIV.

(4) The Commissioner of any State in which an Insurer is authorized to do business, or is conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise his or her authority to oversee the market regulation of the activities of the Insurer in accordance with the provisions of the State's law. The Commissioner's enforcement of compliance with the Compact is governed by the following provisions:

(a) With respect to the Commissioner's market regulation of a Product or Advertisement that is approved or certified to the Commission, the content of the Product or Advertisement shall not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards or requirements of the Compact except upon a final order of the Commission, issued at the request of a Commissioner after prior notice to the Insurer and an opportunity for hearing before the Commission.

(b) Before a Commissioner may bring an action for violation of any provision, standard or requirement of the Compact relating to the content of an Advertisement not approved or certified to the Commission, the Commission, or an authorized Commission officer or employee, must authorize the action. However, authorization pursuant to this paragraph does not require notice to the Insurer, opportunity for hearing or disclosure of requests for authorization or records of the Commission's action on such requests.

The Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a Member, to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to this Compact and which may arise between two or more Compacting States, or between Compacting States and Non-compacting States, and the Commission shall promulgate an Operating Procedure providing for resolution of such disputes.

(1) Insurers and Third-Party Filers seeking to have a Product approved by the Commission shall file the Product with, and pay applicable filing fees to, the Commission. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to restrict or otherwise prevent an insurer from filing its Product with the insurance department in any State wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of insurance, and such filing shall be subject to the laws of the States where filed.

(2) The Commission shall establish appropriate filing and review processes and procedures pursuant to Commission Rules and Operating Procedures. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Commission shall promulgate Rules to establish conditions and procedures under which the Commission will provide public access to Product filing information. In establishing such Rules, the Commission shall consider the interests of the public in having access to such information, as well as protection of personal medical and financial information and trade secrets, that may be contained in a Product filing or supporting information.

(3) Any Product approved by the Commission may be sold or otherwise issued in those Compacting States for which the Insurer is legally authorized to do business.

(1) Not later than thirty (30) days after the Commission has given notice of a disapproved Product or Advertisement filed with the Commission, the Insurer or Third Party Filer whose filing was disapproved may appeal the determination to a review panel appointed by the Commission. The Commission shall promulgate Rules to establish procedures for appointing such review panels and provide for notice and hearing. An allegation that the Commission, in disapproving a Product or Advertisement filed with the Commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner that is an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law, is subject to judicial review in accordance with Article III, Section 4.

(2) The Commission shall have authority to monitor, review and reconsider Products and Advertisement subsequent to their filing or approval upon a finding that the product does not meet the relevant Uniform Standard. Where appropriate, the Commission may withdraw or modify its approval after proper notice and hearing, subject to the appeal process in Section 1 above.

(1) The Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment and organization. To fund the cost of its initial operations, the Commission may accept contributions and other forms of funding from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Compacting States and other sources. Contributions and other forms of funding from other sources shall be of such a nature that the independence of the Commission concerning the performance of its duties shall not be compromised.

(2) The Commission shall collect a filing fee from each Insurer and Third Party Filer filing a product with the Commission to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Commission and its staff in a total amount sufficient to cover the Commission's annual budget.

(3) The Commission's budget for a fiscal year shall not be approved until it has been subject to notice and comment as set forth in Article VII of this Compact.

(4) The Commission shall be exempt from all taxation in and by the Compacting States.

(5) The Commission shall not pledge the credit of any Compacting State, except by and with the appropriate legal authority of that Compacting State.

(6) The Commission shall keep complete and accurate accounts of all its internal receipts, including grants and donations, and disbursements of all funds under its control. The internal financial accounts of the Commission shall be subject to the accounting procedures established under its Bylaws. The financial accounts and reports including the system of internal controls and procedures of the Commission shall be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant. Upon the determination of the Commission, but no less frequently than every three (3) years, the review of the independent auditor shall include a management and performance audit of the Commission. The Commission shall make an Annual Report to the Governor and legislature of the Compacting States, which shall include a report of the independent audit. The Commission's internal accounts shall not be confidential and such materials may be shared with the Commissioner of any Compacting State upon request provided, however, that any work papers related to any internal or independent audit and any information regarding the privacy of individuals and insurers' proprietary information, including trade secrets, shall remain confidential.

(7) No Compacting State shall have any claim to or ownership of any property held by or vested in the Commission or to any Commission funds held pursuant to the provisions of this Compact.

(1) Any State is eligible to become a Compacting State.

(2) The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the Compact into law by two Compacting States; provided, the Commission shall become effective for purposes of adopting Uniform Standards for, reviewing, and giving approval or disapproval of, Products filed with the Commission that satisfy applicable Uniform Standards only after twenty-six (26) States are Compacting States or, alternatively, by States representing greater than forty percent (40%) of the premium volume for life insurance, annuity, disability income and long-term care insurance products, based on records of the NAIC for the prior year. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other Compacting State upon enactment of the Compact into law by that State.

(3) Amendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Commission for enactment by the Compacting States. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Commission and the Compacting States unless and until all Compacting States enact the amendment into law.

(1) Withdrawal

(a) Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State; provided, that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact ("Withdrawing State") by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law.

(b) The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repealing statute. However, the withdrawal shall not apply to any product filings approved or self-certified, or any Advertisement of such products, on the date the repealing statute becomes effective, except by mutual agreement of the Commission and the Withdrawing State unless the approval is rescinded by the Withdrawing State as provided in Paragraph (e) of this section.

(c) The Commissioner of the Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the Management Committee in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the Withdrawing State.

(d) The Commission shall notify the other Compacting States of the introduction of such legislation within ten (10) days after its receipt of notice thereof.

(e) The Withdrawing State is responsible for all obligations, duties and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal, except to the extent those obligations may have been released or relinquished by mutual agreement of the Commission and the Withdrawing State. The Commission's approval of Products and Advertisement prior to the effective date of withdrawal shall continue to be effective and be given full force and effect in the Withdrawing State, unless formally rescinded by the Withdrawing State in the same manner as provided by the laws of the Withdrawing State for the prospective disapproval of products or advertisement previously approved under state law.

(f) Reinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur upon the effective date of the Withdrawing State reenacting the Compact.

(2) Default

(a) If the Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted ("Defaulting State") in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the Bylaws or duly promulgated Rules or Operating Procedures, then, after notice and hearing as set forth in the Bylaws, all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact on the Defaulting State shall be suspended from the effective date of default as fixed by the Commission. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform its obligations or responsibilities, and any other grounds designated in Commission Rules. The Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the Defaulting State's suspension pending a cure of the default. The Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Commission, the Defaulting State shall be terminated from the Compact and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.

(b) Product approvals by the Commission or product self-certifications, or any Advertisement in connection with such product, that are in force on the effective date of termination shall remain in force in the Defaulting State in the same manner as if the Defaulting State had withdrawn voluntarily pursuant to Section 1 of this article.

(c) Reinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires a reenactment of the Compact.

(3) Dissolution of Compact

(a) The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State which reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State.

(b) Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the Bylaws.

(1) The provisions of this Compact shall be severable; and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Compact shall be enforceable.

(2) The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.

(1) Other Laws

(a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Compacting State, except as provided in Paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) For any Product approved or certified to the Commission, the Rules, Uniform Standards and any other requirements of the Commission shall constitute the exclusive provisions applicable to the content, approval and certification of such Products. For Advertisement that is subject to the Commission's authority, any Rule, Uniform Standard or other requirement of the Commission which governs the content of the Advertisement shall constitute the exclusive provision that a Commissioner may apply to the content of the Advertisement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action taken by the Commission shall abrogate or restrict: (i) the access of any person to state courts; (ii) remedies available under state law related to breach of contract, tort, or other laws not specifically directed to the content of the Product; (iii) state law relating to the construction of insurance contracts; or (iv) the authority of the attorney general of the state, including but not limited to maintaining any actions or proceedings, as authorized by law.

###### Sec. 21.42.705.   Opt-out duties, guidelines, remedies.

(a) As a participant in the Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Compact, it is the policy of the state to opt out, and the director shall opt out, of any Uniform Standard that provides a materially lower level of protection for or materially diminishes the rights of Alaska policyholders or policy applicants under Alaska law.

(b) If the director or a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the policy set out in (a) of this section has been violated, notice of the violation shall be given to the legislature, and reasonable and prompt measures shall be taken to opt out of the Uniform Standard that does not comply with the policy statement set out in (a) of this section to the extent that such action is permissible under the Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Compact.

## Chapter 45. Life Insurance and Annuities.

###### Sec. 21.45.010.   Applicability.

This chapter applies only to contracts of life insurance and annuities, other than reinsurance, group life insurance, and group annuities.

###### Sec. 21.45.020.   Standards provisions required; return and refund.

(a) A policy of life insurance, other than group and pure endowments with or without return of premiums or of premiums and interest, may not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance all of the applicable provisions required by AS 21.45.030§21.45.150. This section does not apply to annuity contracts or to a provision of a life insurance policy, or contract supplemental to it, relating to health insurance benefits or to additional benefits in the event of death by accident or accidental means.

(b) The provisions or portions of provisions not applicable to single premium or term policies may not to that extent be incorporated in the policy.

(c) A life insurance policy or annuity contract delivered or issued for delivery in this state and each life insurance policy or annuity contract application must contain a notice prominently printed on or attached to the first page stating

(1) on written request, an insurer is required to provide, within a reasonable time, reasonable factual information regarding the benefits and provisions of the policy or contract to the policy or contract holder; and

(2) if, for any reason, the policy or contract holder is not satisfied with the policy or contract, the policy or contract holder may return the policy or contract within 10 days after the policy or contract is delivered and, except as provided in (d) of this section, receive a refund of all money paid.

(d) For a variable life insurance policy or variable annuity contract, the refund under (c) of this section must equal the sum of

(1) the difference between the premiums paid, including any policy or contract fees or other charges and the amounts allocated to any separate accounts under the policy or contract; and

(2) the value of amounts allocated to any separate accounts on the date the returned policy is received by the insurer or its insurance producer.

###### Sec. 21.45.030.   Grace period.

There shall be a provision that a grace period of 30 days, or, at the option of the insurer, of one month of not less than 30 days, or of four weeks in the case of industrial life insurance policies the premiums for which are payable more frequently than monthly, is allowed within which the payment of each premium after the first premium may be made, during which period of grace the policy shall continue in full force.  If a claim arises under the policy during the period of grace the amount of the premium due or overdue may be deducted from the policy proceeds.

###### Sec. 21.45.040.   Incontestability.

There shall be a provision that the policy, exclusive of provisions relating to health insurance benefits or to additional benefits in the event of death by accident or accidental means and except for nonpayment of premiums, is uncontestable after it has been in force during the lifetime of the insured for a period of two years from its date of issue.

###### Sec. 21.45.050.   Entire contract.

There shall be a provision that the policy, or the policy and the policy application if a copy of the application is endorsed upon or attached to the policy when issued, constitute the entire contract between the parties, and if the application is made a part of the policy, that all statements contained in the application shall, in the absence of fraud, be considered representations and not warranties.

###### Sec. 21.45.060.   Misstatement of age.

Except as provided in AS 21.45.210, there shall be a provision that if the age of the insured or of another person whose age is considered in determining the premium or benefit has been misstated, any amount payable or benefit accruing under the policy shall be such as the premium would have purchased at the correct age or ages.

###### Sec. 21.45.070.   Dividends.

(a) Except as provided in AS 21.45.220, there shall be a provision in participating policies that, beginning not later than the end of the third policy year, the insurer shall annually ascertain and apportion the divisible surplus, if any, that will accrue on the policy anniversary or other dividend date specified in the policy if the policy is in force and all premiums to that date are paid.  Except as hereinafter provided, any dividend becoming payable shall, at the option of the party entitled to elect the option, be either

(1) payable in cash; or

(2) applied to one of the other dividend options that may be provided by the policy; if any other dividend option is provided, the policy must further state which options shall be automatically effective when the party does not elect another option; if the policy specifies a period within which the other dividend option may be elected, the period may not be less than 30 days following the date on which the dividend is due and payable; the annually apportioned dividend shall be payable in cash even though the policy provides that payment of the dividend is to be deferred for a specified period if the period does not exceed six years from the date of apportionment and that interest will be added to the dividend at a specified rate; if a participating policy provides that the benefit under a paid-up nonforfeiture provision is to be participating, it may provide that any divisible surplus becoming payable or apportioned while the insurance is in force under the nonforfeiture provision shall be applied in the manner set out in the policy.

(b) In participating industrial life insurance policies, in lieu of the provision required in (a) of this section, there shall be a provision that, beginning not later than the end of the fifth policy year, the policy shall participate annually in the divisible surplus, if any, in the manner set out in the policy.

###### Sec. 21.45.080.   Policy loan.

(a) There shall be a provision that after three full years' premiums have been paid and after the policy has a cash surrender value and while no premium is in default beyond the grace period for payment, the insurer will advance, on proper assignment or pledge of the policy and on the sole security of the policy, at a specified rate of interest not exceeding eight percent a year, an amount equal to or, at the option of the party entitled to it, less than the loan value of the policy.  The director may authorize rates of interest in excess of six percent only on a finding that the holders of policies will benefit from the increased earnings of the insurer resulting from the higher rates, through the use of higher dividends or lower premiums, or both.  The loan value of the policy shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value at the end of the then current policy year, except that the insurer may deduct, either from the loan value or from the proceeds of the loan, an existing indebtedness not already deducted in determining the cash surrender value including interest then accrued but not due, the unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year, and interest on the loan to the end of the current policy year.  The policy may also provide that if interest on an indebtedness is not paid when due it shall then be added to the existing indebtedness and shall bear interest at the same rate, and that if and when the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the loan value of the policy, the policy shall terminate and become void.  The policy must reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of a premium to the insurer, for six months after the date of the loan application.  The policy, at the insurer's option, may provide for automatic premium loan, subject to an election of the party entitled to elect.  Except as provided in (e) of this section, the required interest rates on policy loans set out in this section apply only to policies issued before July 1, 1982.

(b) This section does not apply to term policies or to term insurance benefits provided by rider or supplemental policy provisions, or to industrial life insurance policies.

(c) A policy issued on or after July 1, 1982, must have a provision specifying an interest rate on a policy loan not to exceed eight percent a year, or a provision permitting an adjustable maximum interest rate established under this subsection.  An adjustable maximum rate of interest on a policy loan determined under this subsection may not exceed the higher of the published monthly average for the calendar month ending two months before the date on which the rate is determined, or the rate used to compute cash surrender values under the policy during the applicable period plus one-twelfth of a percentage point multiplied by the number of months in the applicable period.  If an adjustable maximum rate of interest is used in a policy under this subsection, the policy must contain a provision that states times for the adjustment of the interest rate for that policy.  Adjustment shall occur at least once every 12 months, but not more often than once every three months.  The interest rate being charged may be increased if the published monthly average increases by one-half percent or more and the interest rate being charged must be reduced if the published monthly average decreases by one-half percent or more.  A life insurer shall (1) notify the policyholder of the initial rate of interest on the loan at the time a cash loan is made; (2) notify a policyholder who obtains a premium loan of the initial rate of interest on the loan as soon as it is reasonably possible to do so after making an initial premium loan; except as provided in (3) of this subsection, notice does not have to be given to the policyholder when a second or subsequent premium loan is added; (3) send reasonable advance notice of any increase in the rate to a policyholder who has a policy loan; and (4) include other relevant information on adjustment of interest rates in a notice required under this subsection.  The loan value of the policy shall be determined in accordance with (a) of this section.  A policy may not be terminated in a policy year as the sole result of a change in the interest rate during that policy year. If an interest rate changes, the insurer shall maintain coverage during the policy year until the date on which the policy would have terminated if the interest rate had not changed.

(d) In (c) of this section

(1) "interest rate" includes a rate of interest charged for reinstatement of policy loans for the period during and after the lapse of a policy;

(2) "policy" includes certificates issued by a fraternal benefit society and annuity contracts that provide for policy loans;

(3) "policy loan" includes a premium loan made under a policy to pay a premium that was not paid to the life insurer as it became due;

(4) "policyholder" includes an owner of a policy or a person designated to pay policy premiums according to the records of the life insurer;

(5) "published monthly average" means the monthly average of corporate bond yields as published by Moody's Investor Service, Inc., or its successor, or if Moody's corporate bond yield average-monthly average corporates is not published, a substantially similar average, established by regulation adopted by the director.

(e) The provisions of (c) of this section on interest rates apply only to policy loans made on policies issued on or after July 1, 1982, except that if a policyholder agrees in writing to the applicability of (c) of this section to a policy issued before July 1, 1982, that subsection applies to policy loans made on that policy.

The policy may also include a similar provision applicable to other payments due under the policy.

###### Sec. 21.45.150.   Title.

There shall be a title on the policy, briefly describing it.

###### Sec. 21.45.160.   Excluded or restricted coverage.

A clause in a policy of life insurance stating that the policy shall be incontestable after a specified period precludes only a contest of the validity of the policy and does not preclude the assertion at any time of defenses based upon provisions in the policy that exclude or restrict coverage, whether or not the restrictions or exclusions are excepted in such clause.

###### Sec. 21.45.170.   Standard provisions: annuity and pure endowment contracts.

(3) giving the insurer the right to declare the policy void because the insured has been rejected for insurance by another insurer, unless the right is conditioned upon a showing by the insurer that knowledge of the rejection would have led to a refusal by the insurer to make the contract.

###### Sec. 21.45.270.   Incontestability, limitation of liability after reinstatement.

(a) A reinstated policy of life insurance or annuity contract may be contested on account of fraud or misrepresentation of facts material to the reinstatement only for the same period following reinstatement and with the same conditions and exceptions as the policy provides with respect to contestability after original issuance.

(b) When a life insurance policy or annuity contract is reinstated, the reinstated policy or contract may exclude or restrict liability to the same extent that the liability might have been or was excluded or restricted when the policy or contract was originally issued, and the exclusion or restriction shall be effective from the date of reinstatement.

###### Sec. 21.45.280.   Policy settlements.

A life insurer shall have the power to hold under agreement the proceeds of any policy issued by it, upon the terms and restrictions as to revocation by the policyholder and control by beneficiaries, and with the exemptions from the claims of creditors of beneficiaries other than the policyholder as set out in the policy or as agreed to in writing by the insurer and the policyholder.

###### Sec. 21.45.300.   Standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance.

(a) This section shall be known as the standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance.

(b) In the case of policies issued on and after the operative date of this section as defined in (cc) of this section a policy of life insurance, except as stated in (aa) of this section, may not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains the following provisions, or corresponding provisions that in the opinion of the director are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are the minimum requirements specified in this section and are essentially in compliance with (z) of this section:

(1) that, in the event of default in a premium payment, after premiums have been paid for at least one full year, the insurer will grant, upon proper request not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of the due date, of the amount as may be specified in this section;

(2) that, upon surrender of the policy within 60 days after the due date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least three full years in the case of ordinary insurance and five full years in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, instead of a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of the amount specified;

(3) that a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make the election elects another available option not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default;

(4) that if the policy shall have become paid up by completion of premium payments, or if it is continued under a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance, or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, upon surrender of the policy within 30 days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of the amount specified;

(5) in the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary, either during the first 20 policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, such values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the insurer on the policy;

(6) a statement that the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or under the insurance law of this state; an explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy; or if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated in the policy, a statement that the method of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is delivered; and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which the values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy;

(7) that instead of a stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit as described in (1) of this subsection, the insurer may substitute, upon proper request not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit that provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount of earlier payment of endowment benefits;

(8) in the case of a policy which causes on a basis guaranteed in the policy an unscheduled change in benefits or premiums or which provides an option for a change in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate, and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy.

(c) Any of the provisions or portions of provisions set out in (b) of this section that are not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy. The insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of a cash surrender value for a period of six months after demand has been made on the policy surrendered.

(d) A cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by (b) of this section, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value on the anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, if there has been no default, over the sum of

(1) the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in (h)§(w) of this section, corresponding to premiums that would have fallen on and after the anniversary; and

(2) the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.

(e) Notwithstanding (d) of this section, if a policy issued on or after the operative date of (w) of this section provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in (d) of this section shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in (d) of this section for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the same rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in (d) of this section for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by the rider or supplemental policy provision.

(f) Notwithstanding (d) of this section, if a family policy issued on or after April 7, 1984, defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse is age 71, the cash surrender value referred to in (d) of this section shall be an amount not less than the cash surrender value as defined in (d) of this section for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in (d) for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by the term insurance on the life of the spouse. A cash surrender value available within 30 days after any anniversary under a policy paid-up by completion of all premium payments, or a policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits whether or not required by (b) of this section, shall be an amount not less than the present value, on the anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.

(g) A paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in the premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of the anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value provided for by the policy or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by this section in the absence of the conditions that premiums shall have been paid for at least a specified period.

(h) Except as provided in (j) of this section, the adjusted premiums for a policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be the uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding extra premiums on a substandard policy that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all the adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of (1) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (2) two percent of the amount of the insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as defined, if the amount of insurance varies with the duration of the policy; (3) 40 percent of the adjusted premiums for the first policy year; (4) 25 percent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less, except that in applying the percentage specified in (3) and (4) of this subsection no adjusted premiums shall be considered to exceed four percent of the amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto. Whenever the plan or term of a policy has been changed, either by request of the insured or automatically in accordance with the provisions of the policy, the date of inception of the changed policy for the purposes of determining a nonforfeiture benefit or cash surrender value shall be the date as of which the age of the insured is determined for the purposes of the changed policy. The date of issue of a policy for the purposes of this section shall be the date on which the rated age of the insured is determined. This subsection does not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of (w) of this section.

(i) If a policy provides an amount of insurance that varies with the duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount of insurance for the purpose of (h) of this section shall be considered to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term the amount of which does not vary with the duration and the benefit under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy, except that in the case of a policy a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age 10, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy before the attainment of age 10 were the amount provided by the policy at age 10.

(j) The adjusted premiums for a policy which provides term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to (1) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the term insurance benefits, increased during the period for which premiums for the term insurance benefits are payable, by (2) the adjusted premiums for the term insurance, the foregoing items (1) and (2) being calculated separately in accordance with (h) and (i) of this section, except that, for the purposes of (h)(2), (3) and (4) of this section, the amount of insurance of equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in (2) of this subsection shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in (1) of this subsection.

(k) All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioner's 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, except that for any category or ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured. Except as provided in (l) of this section, the calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. The rate of interest specified in the policy may not exceed three and one-half percent a year except that (1) a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half percent a year may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1978, and (2) a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half percent a year may be used for a single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy. In calculating the present value of paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed in the case of a policy of ordinary insurance, may be not more than those shown in the Commissioner's 1958 Extended Term Insurance Table. In the case of a policy of industrial insurance, the rates of mortality may be not more than 130 percent of the rates of mortality according to the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. The calculation of the adjusted premiums and present values for insurance issued on a substandard basis may be based on another table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the director. This subsection does not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of (w) of this section.

(l) In case of industrial policies issued on or after January 1, 1970, the adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioner's 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, however, that specified the rate of interest specified in the policy may not exceed three and one-half percent a year except that (1) a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half percent a year may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1978; and (2) a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half percent a year may be used for a single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy. In calculating the present value of paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioner's 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. The calculation of the adjusted premiums and present values for insurance issued on a substandard basis may be based on a table of mortality specified by the insurer and approved by the director. This subsection does not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of (w) of this section.

(m) Except as provided in (s) of this section, the adjusted premiums for a policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be a uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding a uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of (1) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (2) one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years; and (3) 125 percent of the nonforfeiture net level premium as defined in (n)§(t) of this section. In applying the percentage specified in (3) of this subsection a nonforfeiture net level premium may not exceed four percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this subsection shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined. This subsection applies to all policies issued after the operative date of (w) of this section.

(n) The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one a year payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due. This subsection applies to all policies issued after the operative date of (w) of this section.

(o) In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of a change in the benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums, and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change. This subsection applies to all policies issued after the operative date of (w) of this section.

(p) Except as provided in (s) of this section, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for a policy shall be a uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of (1) the sum of (A) the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; and (B) the additional expense allowance, if any; over (2) the then cash surrender value if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy. This subsection applies to all policies issued after the operative date of (w) of this section.

(q) The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of (1) one percent of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years after the change over the average amount of insurance before the change at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years after the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy; and (2) 125 percent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium. This subsection applies to all policies issued after the operative date of (w) of this section.

(r) The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing (1) by (2) where

(1) equals the sum of

(A) the nonforfeiture net level premium applicable before the change times the present value of an annuity of one a year payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred; and

(B) the present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; and

(2) equals the present value of an annuity of one a year payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due. This subsection applies to all policies issued after the operative date of (w) of this section.

(s) Notwithstanding (m)§(q) of this section, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, the policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, the adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated as if it were issued to provide those higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis. This subsection applies to all policies issued after the operative date of (w) of this section.

(t) The adjusted premiums and present values for a policy of ordinary insurance referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table or, at the election of the insurer for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors. The adjusted premiums and present values for a policy of industrial insurance shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. The adjusted premiums and present values for a policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this subsection for policies issued in that calendar year. However,

(1) at the option of the insurer, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this subsection, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year;

(2) under a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including a paid-up dividend addition, a cash surrender value available, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of the paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any;

(3) an insurer may calculate the amount of a guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up addition under the policy, on the basis of an interest rate not less than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values;

(4) in calculating the present value of paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance;

(5) for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculations of adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications mentioned above;

(6) for policies issued before the operative date of the valuation manual, a Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that is approved by regulation adopted by the director for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table; for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual must provide the Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without the Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table; if the director approves by regulation a Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture provided by the valuation manual;

(7) for policies issued before the operative date of the valuation manual, a Commissioners Standard Industrial Mortality Table, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that is approved by regulation adopted by the director for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table; for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual must provide the Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Extended Term Insurance Table; if the director approves by regulation a Commissioners Standard Industrial Mortality Table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture provided by the valuation manual.

(u) For a policy issued before the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture annual interest rate for a policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to 125 percent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for the policy as defined in the Standard Valuation Law, rounded to the nearer one quarter of one percent, if the nonforfeiture interest rate is not less than four percent; for a policy issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture annual interest rate for a policy issued in a particular calendar year is provided by the valuation manual.

(v) Notwithstanding any other provision in this title, a refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for a previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provision of that policy form. This subsection applies to all policies issued after the operative date of (w) of this section.

(w) An insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subsection after a specified date before January 1, 1989. That date shall be the operative date of this subsection for the insurer. If an insurer makes no election, the operative date of this subsection for the insurer shall be January 1, 1989.

(x) In the case of a plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance which is of such a nature than minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (b)§(k) or (m) of this section,

(1) the director must be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insured as the minimum benefits otherwise required by subsections (b)§(w) of this section;

(2) the director must be satisfied that the benefits and pattern of premiums of the plan do not mislead prospective policyholders or insureds;

(3) the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by the plan must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, as determined by regulations adopted by the director.

(y) A cash surrender value and a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary. All values referred to in (b)§(w) of this section may be calculated upon the assumption that a death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide the additions. Notwithstanding the provisions of (d) of this section, certain additional benefits and premiums for those additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this section, and no additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. The benefits to be disregarded are those paid

(1) in the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means;

(2) in the event of total and permanent disability;

(3) as a reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits;

(4) as term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this section would not apply;

(5) as term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if the term insurance expires before the child's age is 26, is uniform in amount after the child's age is one, and has not become paid-up by reason of the death of a parent of the child; and

(6) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits.

(z) This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this section, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1987. The cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two-tenths of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years, from the sum of the greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified and the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness of the insurer under the policy. The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value on the policy anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors as defined in this subsection, corresponding to the premiums which would have fallen due on and after the policy anniversary. Provided, however, that the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage as described in subsection (d) or (j), whichever is applicable, be the same as are the effects specified in (d) or (j) of this section, whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values as defined in that subsection. The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in (h), (i), (j) and (m) of this section, whichever is applicable. Except as is required by the next succeeding sentence of this subsection, the percentage (1) must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of (A) the fifth policy anniversary and (B) the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness of at least two-tenths of one percent of either the amount, of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years; and (2) must be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in (1) of this subsection may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years. Provided, that no basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, defined in (h), (i), and (j) of this section or in (m) of this section, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subsection shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy compliance with the other subsections of this section. The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall include all endowment benefits provided for by the policy. Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary, and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manner specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in (b)§(g), (m), and (y) of this section. The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed as items (1) through (6) in (y) of this section shall conform with the principles of this subsection.

(aa) This section does not apply to any of the following:

(1) reinsurance;

(2) group insurance;

(3) pure endowment;

(4) annuity or reversionary annuity contract;

(5) term policy of uniform amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, or renewal thereof, of 20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;

(6) term policy of decreasing amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, on which each adjusted premium, calculated as specified in (h)§(w) of this section is less than the adjusted premiums calculated, on a policy of uniform amount or renewal thereof, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, issued at the same age and for the same initial amount of insurance for a term defined as follows: for ages at issue 50 and under, the term shall be 15 years; thereafter, the term decrease one year for each year of age beyond 50, and for a term of 20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;

(7) policy, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, for which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, at the beginning of any policy year, calculated as specified in (d)§(w) of this section, exceeds two and one-half percent of the amount of insurance at the beginning of the same policy year;

(8) policy which shall be delivered outside this state through an agent or other representative of the insurer issuing the policy.

(bb) For purposes of determining the applicability of subsection (aa), the at expiry for a joint term life insurance policy shall be the age at expiry of the oldest life.

(cc) The operative date of this section is January 1, 1968 except that an insurer may elect to comply with this section before that date by filing a written notice of election with the director. A written notice of election is not effective unless the insurer specifies in the notice

(1) the date upon which this section is to be operative, which date must be later than the date on which the notice is filed;

(2) the policies to which this section applies.

(dd) In this section, "operative date of the valuation manual" means January 1 of the first calendar year that the valuation manual described in AS 21.18.112 is effective.

###### Sec. 21.45.305.   Standard nonforfeiture law for individual deferred annuities.

(a) This section does not apply to any reinsurance, group annuity purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under  26 U.S.C. 408 (Internal Revenue Code), as amended, premium deposit fund, variable annuity, investment annuity, immediate annuity, any deferred annuity contract after annuity payments have commenced, or reversionary annuity, nor to any contract that shall be delivered outside this state through an agent or other representative of the company issuing the contract.

(b) In the case of contracts issued on or after the operative date of this section as defined in (k) of this section, no contract of annuity, except as stated in (a) of this section, may be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions that, in the opinion of the director, are at least as favorable to the contract holder, upon cessation of payment of considerations under the contract: (1) that, upon cessation of payment of considerations under a contract or upon the written request of the contract holder, the company will grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the contract of the value specified in (d)§(g) and (i) of this section; (2) if a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that, upon surrender of the contract at or before the commencement of any annuity payments, the company will pay, in lieu of any paid-up annuity benefit, a cash surrender benefit of the amount specified in (d), (e), (g) and (i) of this section; the company may reserve the right to defer the payment of that cash surrender benefit for a period not to exceed six months after demand for the payment with surrender of the contract after making a written request that addresses the necessity and equitableness to all contract holders of the deferral and after receiving written approval by the director; (3) a statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of those benefits; (4) a statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which those benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the company to the contract, any indebtedness to the company on the contract, or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract. Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, any deferred annuity contract may provide that, if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of two full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from considerations paid before that period would be less than $20 monthly, the company may, at its option, terminate the contract by payment in cash of the then present value of the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis of the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by that payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under the contract.

(c) The minimum values as specified in (d)§(g) and (i) of this section of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based upon minimum nonforfeiture amounts as defined in this section:

(1) The minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or before the commencement of any annuity payments shall be equal to an accumulation up to that time at a rate of interest established under (2) of this subsection of the net considerations as defined in this paragraph paid before that time, decreased by the sum of (A) any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at a rate of interest established under (2) of this subsection; (B) the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued; (C) an annual contract charge of $50, accumulated at a rate of interest established under (2) of this subsection; and (D) any premium tax paid by the company for the contract, accumulated at a rate of interest established under (2) of this subsection. The net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be an amount equal to 871/2 percent of the corresponding gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year.

(2) The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of three percent a year or the following, which shall be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset: (A) the five-year constant maturity treasury rate reported by the federal reserve as of a date, or average over a period, rounded to the nearest  1/  20 of one percent, specified in the contract not more than 15 months before the contract issue date or redetermination date under (D) of this paragraph; (B) reduced by 125 basis points; (C) where the resulting interest rate is not less than one percent; and (D) the interest rate must apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods; the redetermination date, basis, and period, if any, must be stated in the contract; the basis is the date or average over a specified period that produces the value of the five-year constant maturity treasury rate to be used at each redetermination date.

(3) During the period or term that a contract provides substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit, the contract may increase the reduction described in (2)(B) of this subsection by up to an additional 100 basis points to reflect the value of the equity index benefit. The present value at the contract issue date, and at each following redetermination date, of the additional reduction may not exceed the market value of the benefit. The director may require a demonstration of the present value of the additional reduction and may disallow or limit the additional reduction if the demonstration does not prove that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit.

(4) The director may by regulation provide for further adjustments to the calculation of minimum nonforfeiture amounts for contracts that provide substantive participation in an equity index benefit or for other contracts that the director determines require adjustment. An adjustment to the calculation of minimum nonforfeiture amounts authorized under this subsection may not result in an interest rate of less than one percent.

(d) Any paid-up annuity benefit available under a contract shall be such that its present value on the date annuity payments are to commence is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on that date.  Such present value shall be computed using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate specified in the contract for determining the minimum paid-up annuity benefits guaranteed in the contract.

(e) For contracts that provide cash surrender benefits, the cash surrender benefits available before maturity may not be less than the present value as of the date of surrender of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit that would be provided under the contract at maturity arising from considerations paid before the time of cash surrender reduced by the amount appropriate to reflect any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract. The present value shall be calculated on the basis of an interest rate not more than one percent higher than the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating considerations to determine the maturity value, unless a higher rate is approved by the director under  AS 21.42.120, decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract. In no event may any cash surrender benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. The death benefit under those contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit.

(f) For contracts which do not provide cash surrender benefits, the present value of any paid-up annuity benefit available as a nonforfeiture option at any time before maturity may not be less than the present value of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit provided under the contract arising from considerations paid before the time the contract is surrendered in exchange for, or changed to, a deferred paid-up annuity.  The present value shall be calculated for the period before the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine the maturity value, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract.  For contracts which do not provide any death benefits before the commencement of any annuity payments, the present values shall be calculated on the basis of the interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit.  However, in no event may the present value of a paid-up annuity benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time.

(g) For the purpose of determining the benefits calculated under (e) and (f) of this section,

(1) the maturity date shall be the latest date for which election is permitted by the contract, but not later than the anniversary of the contract next following the annuitant's 70th birthday or the 10th anniversary of the contract, whichever is later;

(2) a surrender charge may not be imposed on or past the maturity date of the contract, except that, for annuity contracts with one or more renewable guaranteed periods, a new surrender charge schedule may be imposed for each new guaranteed period if

(A) the surrender charge is zero at the end of each guaranteed period and remains zero for at least 30 days;

(B) the contract provides for continuation of the contract without surrender charges, unless the contract holder specifically elects a new guaranteed period with a new surrender charge schedule; and

(C) the renewal period does not exceed 10 years and the maturity date complies with (1) of this subsection;

(3) a contract that provides for flexible considerations may have separate surrender charge schedules associated with each consideration; for purposes of determining the maturity date, the 10th anniversary of the contract is determined separately for each consideration.

(h) Any contract which does not provide cash surrender benefits or does not provide death benefits at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount before the commencement of any annuity payments shall include a statement in a prominent place in the contract that such benefits are not provided.

(i) Any paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefits available at any time, other than on the contract anniversary under any contract with fixed scheduled considerations, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of any scheduled considerations beyond the beginning of the contract year in which cessation of payment of considerations under the contract occurs.

(j) For any contract which provides, within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provision, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding the provisions of (d)§(g) and (i) of this section, additional benefits payable (1) in the event of total and permanent disability, (2) as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits, or (3) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment, and annuity benefits, and considerations for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender, and death benefits that may be required by this section.  The inclusion of such additional benefits is not required in any paid-up benefits, unless those additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender, and death benefits.

(k) After July 6, 1978, any company may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date before July 6, 1980. After the filing of the notice, then upon the specified date, which shall be the operative date of this section for the company, this section shall become operative with respect to annuity contracts thereafter issued by the company.  If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this section for the company shall be July 6, 1980.

###### Sec. 21.45.310.   Prohibited policy plans.

(a) An insurer may not issue for delivery or deliver in this state a life insurance policy or annuity contract issued under any plan for the segregation of policyholders into mathematical groups and providing benefits for a surviving policyholder of a group arising out of the death of another policyholder of that group or under another similar plan.

(b) An insurer may not issue for delivery or deliver in this state a life insurance policy or annuity contract providing benefits or values for surviving or continuing policyholders contingent upon the lapse or termination of the policies of other policyholders, whether by death or otherwise.  This provision does not prohibit the payment or allowance of regular annual dividends or savings under participating forms of policies or contracts, or prohibit the annual distribution to policyholders or beneficiaries of sums representing in part gains to the insurer from lapses, surrenders, or mortality either in general or as resulting from particular classifications of policies.

## Chapter 48. Group Life Insurance.

###### Sec. 21.48.010.   Group requirements for group contracts.

(a) A group life insurance policy may not be issued for delivery in this state unless the group is a bona fide association or the group was formed for purposes other than obtaining insurance or is a trust established, adopted, or participated in by one or more employers or labor unions or by one or more employers and labor unions, and

(1) the policy covers at least two individuals at the date of issue;

(2) an individual eligible for coverage is subject to uniformly applied standards of insurability as may be imposed by the insurer;

(3) amounts of group life insurance are determined based on some plan that will preclude individual selection;

(4) the group life insurance policy is in compliance with the other applicable provisions of this chapter; and

(5) the group meets other requirements established by the director in regulation.

(b) This section does not apply to life insurance policies

(1) insuring only individuals related by blood, marriage, or legal adoption;

(2) insuring only individuals having a common interest through ownership of a business enterprise, or a substantial legal interest or equity in a business enterprise, and who are actively engaged in its management; or

(3) insuring only individuals otherwise having an insurable interest in each other's lives.

(c) Insurance under a group life insurance policy may be extended to insure dependents.  Notwithstanding AS 21.48.170, only one certificate need be issued for delivery to an insured person if a statement concerning a dependent's coverage is included in the certificate.

(d) In this section, "dependents" means the spouse and dependent children of an employee or member of the group.

(e) A group life insurance policy may be issued to a group that does not meet one or more of the requirements under (a) of this section only if the director finds that issuance

(1) is in the best interests of the public;

(2) results in economies of acquisition or administration; and

(3) meets other requirements established by the director in regulation.

(f) An insurer shall submit to the director information satisfactory to the director that the group meets the requirements of (a) or (e) of this section, and the director must affirmatively approve of the group before an insurer may issue a group life policy to a group under (a) or (e) of this section.

###### Sec. 21.48.060.   Debtor groups.

The lives of a group of individuals may be insured under a policy issued to a creditor, who shall be considered the policyholder, to insure the debtors of the creditor, subject to the following requirements:

The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from the accidental injury that may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to the sickness that may begin more than 10 days after that date. In all other respects, the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement.

"Subject to the qualifications set out below, if the insured suffers loss of time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least two years, the insured shall, at least once in every six months after having given notice of the claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of the disability, except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of six months following a filing of proof by the insured or a payment by the insurer on account of the claim or a denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision.  Delay in the giving of notice shall not impair the insured's right to indemnity which would otherwise have accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which the notice is actually given."

###### Sec. 21.51.090.   Claim forms.

There shall be a provision as follows:

"Claim Forms: The insurer, within 10 working days after receipt of a notice of claim, will furnish to the claimant forms that are usually furnished by it for filing proofs of loss.

Failure to furnish proof within the time required shall not invalidate or reduce a claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within that time, provided that the proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise required."

###### Sec. 21.51.110.   Time of payment of claims. [Repealed,§49 ch 80 SLA 2006.]

###### Sec. 21.51.120.   Payment of claims.

(a) A health insurance policy delivered or issued for delivery must contain the following provisions:

(1) indemnity for loss of life shall be paid according to the beneficiary designation and payment provisions contained in the policy that are effective at the time of payment; if a beneficiary has not been designated, indemnity shall be paid to the estate of the insured; accrued indemnities unpaid at the insured's death shall be paid to either the beneficiary or the estate, at the option of the insurer; all other indemnities shall be paid to the insured;

(2) the insurer may, and upon written request of the insured shall, pay indemnities for hospital, nursing, medical, dental, or surgical services directly to the provider of the services; an insurer who pays indemnities to an insured, after the insured has given the insurer written notice in the proof of loss statement of an election of direct payment of indemnities to the provider of the services, shall also pay indemnities to the provider of the services; this paragraph does not require that services be provided by a particular hospital or person;

(3) a covered person may revoke an election of direct payment of indemnities made under this subsection by giving written notice of the revocation to the insurer and to the provider of the services; the written notice of revocation given to the insurer must certify that the covered person has given written notice of revocation to the provider of the services; revocation of an election of direct payment is not effective until the notice of revocation is received by the insurer and the provider of the services;

(4) the right of the insured to request payment of indemnities for hospital, nursing, medical, dental, or surgical services directly to the provider of the services or to another person may be transferred to a person who is not the insured by a qualified domestic relations order; rights under the qualified domestic relations order do not take effect until the order is received by the insurer; in this paragraph, "qualified domestic relations order" means an order or judgment in a divorce or dissolution action under AS 25.24 that designates a person to determine to whom indemnities for a named beneficiary should be paid under a health insurance policy.

(b) A health insurance policy delivered or issued for delivery may, at the option of the insurer, require that an indemnity in an amount not to exceed $1,000 that is payable to the estate of the insured, an insured or beneficiary who is a minor, or an insured who is not competent to give a valid release, be paid to a relative by blood or marriage, or a beneficiary that the insured determines is equitably entitled to the payment. A good faith payment by the insurer under this subsection fully discharges the insurer to the extent of the payment.

###### Sec. 21.51.150.   Change of beneficiary.

There shall be a provision as follows:

"Change of Beneficiary: Unless the insured makes an irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change a beneficiary is reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to a change of beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy." (The first clause of this provision, relating to the irrevocable designation of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer's option.)

###### Sec. 21.51.160.   Optional policy provisions.

Except as provided in AS 21.51.030(b), a policy delivered or issued for delivery to a person in this state may not contain provisions respecting the matters set out in AS 21.51.170§21.51.260 unless the provisions are in the words in which the same appear in the applicable section, except that the insurer may, at its option, use in lieu of the provision a corresponding provision of different wording approved by the director that is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary.  The provision contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate caption or, at the option of the insurer, by the appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the director may approve.

###### Sec. 21.51.170.   Change of occupation.

There may be a provision as follows:

"Change of Occupation: If the insured is injured or contracts sickness after changing occupations to one classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer will pay only the portion of the indemnities provided in this policy which the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by the insurer for the more hazardous occupation.  If the insured changes occupations to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of the change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of the proof, whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those which have been last filed by the insurer before the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or before the date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued; but if the filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in the state before the occurrence of the loss or before the date of proof of change in occupation."

###### Sec. 21.51.180.   Misstatement of age.

There may be a provision as follows:

"Misstatement of Age: If the age of the insured has been misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be that which the premium paid would have purchased at the correct age."

###### Sec. 21.51.190.   Other insurance in this insurer.

(a) There may be a provision as follows:

"Other Insurance in this Insurer: If an accident or sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the insurer to the insured is in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate indemnity for ........ (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $....... (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for the excess shall be returned to the insured or to the estate of the insured."

(b) In lieu of the provision in (a) of this section, there may be a provision as follows:

"Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or policies in this insurer is limited to the one policy elected by the insured, the beneficiary or the estate of the insured, as the case may be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such policies."

###### Sec. 21.51.200.   Insurance with other insurers providing benefits for loss on a provision of service or expense incurred basis.

(a) There may be a provision as follows:

"Insurance With Other Insurers: If there is other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice before the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability under an expense incurred coverage of this policy shall be for the proportion of the loss that the amount that would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like amounts under all the other valid coverages for the same loss of which this insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for the loss and for the return of the portion of the premiums paid that exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined.  For the purpose of applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis, the 'like amount' of the other coverage shall be taken as the amount which the services rendered would have cost in the absence of the coverage."

(b) If the policy provision in (a) of this section is included in a policy that also contains the policy provision set out in AS 21.51.210 there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase§" Expense Incurred Benefits."

For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to an insured, an amount of benefit provided for the insured under a compulsory benefit statute (including a workers' compensation or employer's liability statute), whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise, shall in all cases be considered to be "other valid coverage" of which the insurer has had notice.

"Insurance With Other Insurers: If there is other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice before the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability for the benefits under this policy shall be for the proportion of the indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for the loss that the like indemnities of which the insurer has notice (including the indemnities under this policy) bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for the loss, and for the return of the portion of the premium paid which exceeds the pro rata portion for the indemnities thus determined."

(b) If the policy provision in (a) of this section is included in a policy that also contains the policy provision set out in AS 21.51.200, there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase§" Other Benefits."  The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of "other valid coverage," approved as to form by the director, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or a province of Canada, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the director.  In the absence of this definition the term shall not include group insurance, or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.  For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to an insured, an amount of benefit provided for such insured under any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute), whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise, shall in all cases be considered to be "other valid coverage" of which the insurer has had notice.  In applying the foregoing policy provision no third-party liability coverage shall be included as "other valid coverage."

###### Sec. 21.51.220.   Relation of earnings to insurance.

(a) There may be a provision as follows:

(b) The policy provision in (a) of this section may be inserted only in a policy that the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50, or (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of "valid loss of time coverage," approved as to form by the director, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or another state of the United States or a province of Canada, or to any other coverage that may be approved for inclusion by the director or a combination of these coverages. In the absence of this definition the term may not include coverage provided for the insured under a compulsory benefit statute, including a workers' compensation or employer's liability statute, or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.

#### Article 1. Group and Blanket Health Insurance.

## Chapter 54. Health Insurance.

###### Sec. 21.54.010.   Required provisions of group policies.

Each group health insurance policy must contain in substance the following provisions:

(1) a provision that, in the absence of fraud, all statements made by applicants or the policyholder or by an insured person shall be considered representations and not warranties, and that a statement made for the purpose of effecting insurance may not void the insurance or reduce benefits unless contained in a written instrument signed by the policyholder or the insured person, a copy of which has been furnished to the policyholder or to the insured person or the beneficiary of the insured person;

(2) a provision that the insurer will furnish to the policyholder for delivery to each employee or member of the insured group, a statement in summary form of the essential features of the insurance coverage of the employee or member and to whom benefits are payable; if dependents are included in the coverage, only one certificate need be issued for each family unit;

(3) a provision that to the group originally insured may be added from time to time eligible new employees or members or dependents, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of the policy.

###### Sec. 21.54.015.   Rate requirements; filings; regulations; health care insurance restrictions.

(a) Rates charged for a group health insurance policy may not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.

(b) A health care insurer may decline to cover or may restrict the coverage offered to a self-employed individual under an association plan authorized under AS 21.54.060(a)(6).

(c) Except for large employer health care insurance plan premium rates exempted by the director by regulation under (d) of this section, an insurer shall file with the director the premium rates charged for each health care insurance plan before using them. A premium rate or premium rate change must be on file with the director for a waiting period of at least 45 days before the effective date of the premium rate. That period may be extended by the director or the insurer for an additional 15 days if, during the initial 45-day waiting period, notice is given stating that additional time for consideration of the filing is needed. A filing may become effective at the end of the waiting period unless disapproved by the director during the waiting period. If an insurer fails to provide information requested by the director during the waiting period, the filing is considered withdrawn by the insurer, and the premium rate does not become effective.

(d) The director shall adopt regulations

(1) establishing procedures for the filing and use of rates; and

(2) specifying information that must be submitted in a filing required under (c) of this section.

###### Sec. 21.54.020.   Direct payment to providers.

(a) On the written request of a covered person, a health care insurer shall pay amounts due under a health insurance policy directly to the provider of medical care services. A health insurance policy may not contain a provision that requires services be provided by a particular hospital or person, except as applicable to a health maintenance organization under AS 21.86. If a health care insurer makes a claim payment to the covered person after the covered person has given written notice electing direct payment to the provider of the service, the health care insurer shall also pay that amount to the provider of the service.

(b) A covered person may revoke an election of direct claim payment made under (a) of this section by giving written notice of the revocation to the health care insurer and to the provider of the service. The written notice of revocation to the health care insurer must certify that the covered person has given written notice of revocation to the provider of the service. Revocation of direct claim payment is not effective until the later of the date the health care insurer received the notice of revocation or the date the provider of the service received the revocation.

(c) The right of the covered person to request payment of indemnities under a blanket health insurance policy directly to the provider of the services or to another person may be transferred by a qualified domestic relations order to a person who is not the covered person. Rights under the qualified domestic relations order do not take effect until the order is received by the health care insurer. In this subsection, "qualified domestic relations order" means an order or judgment in a divorce or dissolution action under AS 25.24 that designates a person to determine to whom indemnities for a covered person should be paid under a health insurance policy.

(d) This section does not prohibit a health care insurer from recovering an amount mistakenly paid to a provider or a covered person.

###### Sec. 21.54.030.   Required provisions of blanket policies.

An insurer authorized to write health insurance in this state shall have the power to issue blanket health insurance. A blanket policy may not be issued or delivered in this state unless a copy of the form of the policy has been filed in accordance with AS 21.42.120. Each blanket policy must contain provisions that in the opinion of the director are at least as favorable to the policyholder and the individual insured as the following:

(1) a provision that the policy, including endorsements and a copy of the application, if any, of the policyholder and the persons insured shall constitute the entire contract between the parties, and that any statement made by the policyholder or by a person insured shall in the absence of fraud be considered a representation and not a warranty, and that a statement may not be used in defense to a claim under the policy, unless contained in a written application; the person, a beneficiary, or assignee, shall have the right to make written request to the insurer for a copy of the application and the insurer shall, within 15 days after the receipt of the request at its home office or a branch office of the insurer, deliver or mail to the person making the request a copy of the application;

(2) a provision that written notice of sickness or of injury must be given to the insurer within 20 days after the date when the sickness or injury occurred; failure to give notice within that time may not invalidate or reduce a claim if it is shown that it was not reasonably possible to give the notice and that notice was given as soon as was reasonably possible;

(3) a provision that the insurer will furnish to the policyholder the forms that are usually furnished by it for filing proof of loss; if the forms are not furnished before the expiration of 15 days after the giving of the notice, the claimant shall be considered to have complied with the requirements of the policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proof of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss for which claim is made;

(4) a provision that in the case of claim for loss of time for disability, written proof of the loss must be furnished to the insurer within 90 days after the beginning of the period for which the insurer is liable, and that subsequent written proofs of the continuance of the disability must be furnished to the insurer at the intervals that the insurer may reasonably require, and that in the case of claim for any other loss, written proof of the loss must be furnished to the insurer within 90 days after the date of the loss; failure to furnish the proof within that time does not invalidate or reduce a claim if it is shown that it was not reasonably possible to furnish the proof and that the proof was furnished as soon as was reasonably possible;

(5) a provision that all benefits payable under the policy other than benefits for loss of time will be payable immediately upon receipt of written proof of the loss, and that, subject to proof of loss, all accrued benefits payable under the policy for loss of time will be paid not later than at the expiration of each period of 30 days during the continuance of the period for which the insurer is liable, and that any balance remaining unpaid at the termination of the period will be paid immediately upon receipt of the proof;

(6) a provision that the insurer at its own expense shall have the right and opportunity to examine the person of the insured when and so often as it may reasonably require during the pendency of claim under the policy and also the right and opportunity to make an autopsy in case of death if it is not prohibited by law;

(7) a provision that a civil action may not be brought to recover under the policy before the expiration of 60 days after written proof of loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of the policy and that an action may not be brought after the expiration of three years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished.

###### Sec. 21.54.040.   Application and certificates not required.

An individual application may not be required from a person covered under a blanket health insurance policy or contract, nor is it necessary for the insurer to furnish each person a certificate.

###### Sec. 21.54.050.   Payment of blanket health policy benefits.

(a) All benefits under a blanket health insurance policy shall be paid to (1) the person insured; (2) the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of the person insured; (3) the estate of the person insured; (4) the parent, guardian, or other person actually supporting the person insured, if the person insured is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release; or (5) the employer, if the entire cost of the insurance has been paid by the employer. An insurer may, and upon written request of the covered person shall, within 30 working days after receiving a proof of loss statement, pay benefits directly to the provider of the hospital, nursing, medical, dental, or surgical services. The policy may not contain a provision requiring that services be provided by a particular hospital or person, except as applicable to a health maintenance organization under AS 21.86. If the insurer pays indemnities to the insured after the covered person has given the insurer written notice in the proof of loss statement of an election of direct payment of indemnities to the provider of the service, the insurer shall also pay those indemnities to the provider of the service.

(b) A covered person may revoke an election of direct payment of benefits made under (a) of this section by giving written notice of the revocation to the insurer and to the provider of the services. The written notice of revocation given to the insurer must certify that the covered person has given written notice of revocation to the provider of the services. Revocation of an election of direct payment is not effective until the notice of revocation is received by the insurer and the provider of the services.

(c) The right of the covered person to request payment of indemnities under a group health insurance policy directly to the provider of the services or to another person may be transferred to a person who is not the covered person by a qualified domestic relations order. Rights under the qualified domestic relations order do not take effect until the order is received by the insurer. In this subsection, "qualified domestic relations order" means an order or judgment in a divorce or dissolution action under AS 25.24 that designates a person to determine to whom indemnities for a covered person should be paid under a health insurance policy.

(d) This section does not prohibit an insurer from recovering an indemnity mistakenly paid to a provider or a covered person.

(b) A small employer insurer offering health care insurance is not required to offer or accept applications under AS 21.56.140(a) if

(1) the small employer insurer is only maintaining in-force business and has ceased enrolling new employer groups on or before January 1, 1993; or

(2) the certificate of authority or bylaws of an insurer does not permit the insurer to issue coverage on a marketwide basis; however, an insurer described in this paragraph shall comply with AS 21.56.140 regarding small employers that meet the requirements of the insurer's certificate of authority or bylaws.

(c) A small employer insurer who denies health care insurance coverage in a service area under (a) of this section may not offer coverage in the small employer market within that service area for a period of 180 days after the date the coverage is denied.

The small employer insurer may not reenter the small employer group market until the director has determined that the insurer has sufficient financial reserves to underwrite additional coverage.

(a) An insurance policy, certificate of insurance, notice of proposed insurance, insurance disclosure notice, application for insurance, endorsement, and rider delivered or issued for delivery in this state, and the applicable schedules of premium rates shall be filed with the director before being used.

(b) A document required to be filed under (a) of this section must be on file for a waiting period of 30 days before it is used or becomes effective, unless the director gives prior written approval. This period may be extended for an additional 30 days if the director gives written notice within the waiting period to the insurer making the filing. The director shall disapprove a filing if the premium rate charged is not reasonable in relation to benefits or if it contains provisions that are unjust, unfair, inequitable, misleading, deceptive, encourage misrepresentation of the policy, or are contrary to a provision of this title or a regulation adopted under this title. A filing is considered to be approved unless it is disapproved by the director within the waiting period. In determining the reasonableness of premium rates in relation to benefits, the director may consider claim costs, general and administrative expenses, reasonable compensation to producers, profit, or other relevant data.

(c) If the director notifies the insurer that a document required to be filed under (a) of this section is disapproved, the insurer may not issue or use any part of the document. In providing notice of disapproval to the insurer, the director shall specify the reason for disapproval and indicate that the insurer is entitled to a hearing.

(d) The director may, at any time after a hearing, withdraw approval of a filing on the grounds specified under (b) of this section.

(g) Consumer credit insurance forms used for insurance described under (f) of this section shall be approved by the director if they conform with the requirements specified in this section and if the schedules of premium rates applicable to the insurance evidenced by the certificate or notice are in accordance with the insurer's schedules of premium rates filed with the director. An item required to be filed under (a) of this section shall also be filed as specified in this chapter unless the item relates to a group policy that is delivered in another state and the director has determined that the other state has substantially similar statutes or regulations to this chapter. Upon this determination, the items required to be filed under (a) of this section shall be filed for informational purposes. If the director subsequently determines that the informational filing is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, the insurer may not use the insurance policy, form, certificate, notice of proposed insurance, disclosure notice, advertisement, application for insurance, endorsement, or rider.

The formula to be used in computing refunds shall be filed with and approved by the director.

(c) If a creditor requires a debtor to make a payment for consumer credit insurance and an individual policy or group certificate of insurance is not issued, the creditor shall immediately give written notice to the debtor and shall promptly make an appropriate credit to the account or issue a refund.

(d) The amount charged to a debtor for consumer credit insurance may not exceed the premium charged by the insurer, as computed at the time the charge to the debtor is determined.

(e) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to authorize a payment for insurance prohibited under other provisions of law governing credit transactions.

The purpose of this deposit is to provide a guaranty fund for payment of claims under title guaranties and policies issued in Alaska in the event of the insolvency of the title insurer.

(b) When a title insurance company holding a certificate of authority under this chapter is found to be insolvent by a proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction, the director shall take control of deposits made by the title insurance company and held in this state.

Evidence of the determination shall be preserved and retained in the files of the title insurance company or its agent for a period of not less than 15 years after the policy or contract of title insurance has been issued. In lieu of retaining the original evidence, the title insurance company or the title insurance limited producer, may, in the regular course of business, establish a system by which all or part of these writings are recorded, copied, or reproduced by any photographic, photostatic, microfilm, microcard, miniature photographic, or other process that accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for reproducing the original.

It shall also directly or through its agent own and maintain a comparable title plant for each additional recording district in which it or its agent maintains an office to transact a title insurance business.

###### Sec. 21.66.210.   Joint plant companies.

(a) Two or more title insurance companies or two or more title insurance limited producers, or a combination of title insurance companies and title insurance limited producers, may apply to the director of insurance to form an association, corporation, or other legal entity, for the purpose of engaging in the business of preparing abstracts of title searches from public records or from records to be owned by the entity, upon the basis of which a title insurance limited producer or a title insurance company will issue title policies. The owners or participants are considered to be in compliance with the provisions of this section and AS 21.66.200 if the title plant of the association, corporation, or other legal entity complies with the provisions of this section. The application must contain

(1) a copy of the proposed articles of incorporation or association and the bylaws or agreement governing the operation of the entity;

(2) a list of the owners or participants;

(3) the names and addresses of the persons who will operate the entity, with a description of their experience and qualifications;

(7) basic information, including the joint title plant name, the physical address, the mailing address, the electronic mailing address, and telephone numbers.

(b) If the director finds that (1) the entity will be adequately financed, (2) the persons who will be operating the entity are qualified and (3) the rules of operation as expressed in the articles of incorporation or association and the bylaws will promote the efficiency of the operation of the subscribing owners or participants and will not unduly restrict competition, the director shall issue a certificate of authority to the entity and permit it to organize.  Each application under this section shall be granted or denied in whole or in part by the director within 60 days from the date it is filed.  A certificate of authority issued under this section remains in effect until suspended or revoked by the director.  The fee for the certificate of authority is set under AS 21.06.250.  The certificate of authority is subject to annual continuation. The fee for continuation is set under AS 21.06.250.  A certificate of authority issued under this section may be suspended or revoked by the director after hearing upon notice if the entity ceases to operate as provided in the application or if the director determines that the operation has become a restraint on competition and is not in the interests of the public.  Every entity issued a certificate of authority under this section shall notify the director promptly of every change occurring under this section.

###### Sec. 21.66.220.   Net retained liability.

(a) The net retained liability of a title insurance company under a single title insurance risk assumed in this state may not exceed 50 percent of the net amount remaining after deducting from the sum of its capital, surplus, unearned premium reserve, and voluntary reserves, the value, if any, assigned in the summation to its title plants, as shown in its most recent report on file with the director.  The same limitation applies to any secondary risk assumed by means of reinsurance or to a policy of excess co-insurance.  Upon application by a title insurance company and the showing of good cause, the director may waive the limitation in connection with the assumption of a particular risk.

(b) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the amount of a single insurance risk, as defined in AS 21.66.480, that may be written or assumed by a title insurance company, if (1) it cedes to one or more other title insurance companies, on or before the effective date of the writing or assumption, the portion, or portions, of the risk sufficient to bring its net retained liability within the limits provided in this section; and (2) each cession of risk is also within the limits of this section as applied to the sum of the capital, surplus, unearned premium reserve, and voluntary reserves, less the value, if any, assigned in the summation to the title plants of the assuming and reinsuring title insurance company, as shown by its most recent report on file with the director or commissioner of insurance in the state of its domicile.

###### Sec. 21.66.230.   Power to reinsure.

A title insurance company authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state may cede reinsurance of all or any part of its liability under one or more of its policies or contracts of reinsurance agreements to a title insurance company authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this or any other state or the District of Columbia.  However, no larger amount of reinsurance may be assumed by a title insurance company on a single policy, or contract of title insurance, or on any single title insurance risk as defined in AS 21.66.480, than the title insurance company would be permitted to retain if authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state.  It may also reinsure policies of title insurance issued by other companies on risks whether located in or out of this state.  A title insurance company authorized to transact business in this state shall pay to this state taxes required on all business taxable in this state and reinsured, as provided in this section, with any foreign or alien company not authorized to do business in this state.  Issuance of contracts of reinsurance by a title insurance company not authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in a state or the District of Columbia, reinsuring a title insurance company authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state on property located in this state, does not of itself constitute the doing of business in this state by the reinsuring company.

###### Sec. 21.66.240.   Title plants.

A title insurance company may invest in title plants if it complies at all times with the minimum capital investment requirements under this chapter.  A title plant shall be considered an asset at its fair value.  In determining the fair value of a title plant, no value may be attributed to furniture and fixtures, and the real estate in which the title plant is housed shall be carried as real estate. The value of title abstracts, title briefs, copies of conveyances or other documents, indices, and other records comprising the title plant shall be determined by considering the expenses incurred in obtaining them, the age of them, the cost of replacements less depreciation, and all other relevant factors. Once the value of a title plant is determined under this section, the value may be increased only by the acquisition of another title plant by purchase, consolidation, or merger; however, in no event may the value of the title plant be increased by additions made to it as part of the normal course of abstracting and insuring titles to real estate.  Subject to the limitations in this section and with the approval of the director as provided by AS 21.66.210, a title insurance company may enter into agreements with other title insurance companies to participate in the use, ownership, management, and control of a title plant in order to service the needs of all the title insurance companies, or the title insurance companies may hold stock of a corporation owning and operating a title plant for this purpose.

###### Sec. 21.66.250.   Trust funds.

Except as provided in AS 34.80, trust funds or assets held in a fiduciary capacity by a title insurance company that is authorized to do a trust business shall be invested in accordance with AS 06.26.

###### Sec. 21.66.270.   Title insurance limited producers to be licensed.

A title insurance limited producer shall be licensed in the manner provided for in AS 21.27. A title insurance limited producer may not obtain a license unless the producer is a resident of the state. A title insurance limited producer may not be licensed to sell insurance other than title insurance.

###### Sec. 21.66.280.   Title insurance limited producers, books, and records.

(a) In addition to any other requirement of this title, a title insurance limited producer licensee shall maintain books of accounts and records and vouchers pertaining to the business of title insurance in a manner that the director, or an authorized representative, may readily ascertain whether the licensee has complied with the provisions of this chapter.

(b) A title insurance limited producer licensee may engage in the business of handling escrows, settlements, and closings in connection with the business of title insurance; however,

(1) the licensee shall maintain a separate record of all receipts and disbursements of escrow funds and may not commingle the funds with personal funds or with funds held by the licensee in any other capacity;

(2) the licensee shall comply with the standards of solvency that the director requires; and

(3) the licensee shall submit financial statements that the director requires.

(c) In addition to any other penalty provided by law, if the director determines that a title insurance limited producer licensee has failed to comply with a provision of this section, the director may, after a hearing, revoke the limited producer license.

###### Sec. 21.66.290.   Title insurance limited producer replies to director inquiries.

A title insurance limited producer shall reply in writing promptly, with a copy of the reply mailed to each title insurance company for which the licensee is acting, to an inquiry of the director relating to the licensee's acts as a title insurance limited producer. In addition to any other penalty provided by law, failure to reply is a ground for revocation of the license. A copy of the inquiry shall be sent by the director to each title insurance company for which the licensee is acting.

###### Sec. 21.66.300.   Certain names prohibited.

A title insurance limited producer for a title insurance company may not adopt a firm name containing the words "title insurance", "title guaranty", or "title guarantee", unless the words are followed by the words "agent" or "agency" in the same size and type as the words preceding them. This section does not apply to a title insurance company acting as an agent for another title insurance company.

###### Sec. 21.66.310.   Rebates prohibited.

(a) A title insurer, or officer, employee, attorney, or title insurance limited producer of a title insurer, may not pay, allow, or give or offer to pay, allow, or give, directly or indirectly, as an inducement to obtaining a title insurance business, a rebate, reduction, or abatement of a rate or charge made incident to the issuance of the title insurance, a special favor or advantage, money consideration, or other inducement. A charge made incident to the issuance of the insurance is construed to include, without limitation, escrow, settlement, and closing charges.

(b) An insured named in a title insurance policy or any other person directly or indirectly connected with the transaction involving the issuance of a title insurance policy, including a mortgage lender, real estate broker, builder, or attorney, or an officer, employee, agent, representative, or solicitor of a mortgage lender, real estate broker, builder, attorney, or other person, may not knowingly receive or accept, directly or indirectly, a rebate, reduction, or abatement of a charge or premium or a special favor or advantage, or a monetary consideration or inducement.

(c) Nothing in this section prohibits

(1) the payment of fees for services actually rendered as a result of a title insurance transaction; or

(2) the payment of a commission to a legally appointed title insurance limited producer who issues the policy of title insurance.

###### Sec. 21.66.330.   Examination of records.

If the director has reason to believe that a title insurance limited producer has violated or is in violation of AS 21.66.310, the director shall immediately examine the title insurance limited producer's books of account and record and vouchers pertaining to the business of title insurance. The title insurance limited producer shall pay to the director the cost of an examination conducted under this section.

###### Sec. 21.66.340.   Additional penalty for rebates.

A person who violates AS 21.66.310 is liable to the state for five times the amount or value of the rebate, reduction, or abatement of any rate or charge made incident to the issuance of title insurance, or a special favor or advantage, or a monetary consideration or inducement.

###### Sec. 21.66.350.   Division of rates.

Nothing in this chapter prohibits the division of rates and charges between or among a title insurance company and its agent, two or more title insurance companies, one or more title insurance companies and one or more title insurance limited producers, or two or more title insurance limited producers if the division of rates and charges does not constitute an unlawful rebate and is not in payment of a forwarding fee or finder's fee.

###### Sec. 21.66.360.   Purpose of title insurance rate regulation.

The purpose of AS 21.66.370§21.66.400 is to promote the public welfare by regulating title insurance rates so that they are not excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory, and to authorize cooperative action between or among title insurance companies in rate making and other matters within the scope of this chapter.  Nothing in this chapter is intended to prohibit or discourage uniformity in title insurance rates, rating systems, and rating plans and practices.

###### Sec. 21.66.370.   Rate filing.

(a) A title insurance company shall file with the director its schedules of rates, manuals of classifications, rules and plans relating to schedules of rates or manuals of classification, and every modification of the schedules or manuals that it proposes to use in this state. A filing under this section must contain the effective dates of the documents filed, and indicate the character and extent of the coverage contemplated.

(b) The director shall review the filings as necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.

(c) Subject to the provisions of (e) of this section, a filing shall be on file for a period of 30 days before it becomes effective. The director may, upon written notice given within the 30-day period to the person making the filing, extend the waiting period for an additional period, not to exceed 30 days, in order to complete the review of the filing. Additional extensions of the waiting period may also be made with the consent of the title insurance company. Upon written application by the title insurance company, the director, after review of the application, may authorize a filing or any part of it to become effective upon the expiration of the waiting period or its extension.

(d) Except for rates filed under (e) of this section, a filing that has become effective is considered to meet the requirements of this chapter.

(e) When the director finds that a rate for a particular kind or class of risk cannot practicably be filed before it is used, or any contract or kind of title insurance, by reason of rarity or peculiar circumstances, does not lend itself to advance determination and filing of rates, the director may, under appropriate regulations, permit the rate to be used without a previous filing and waiting period.

(f) A title insurance company or title insurance limited producer may not charge a rate for a policy or contract of title insurance except in accordance with filings or rates that are in effect for the title insurance company as provided in this chapter.

(g) The director may not regulate, or require the filing of, rates paid by title insurance companies for reinsurance contracts or agreements, or policies of excess co-insurance.

###### Sec. 21.66.380.   Justification for rates.

(1) the experience or judgment of the title insurance company making the filing;

(2) its interpretation of any statistical data relied upon;

(3) the experience of other title insurance companies making the filings; or

(4) any other factors that the title insurance company considers relevant.

###### Sec. 21.66.390.   Making of rates.

(a) A title insurance company shall make rates that are not excessive or inadequate, that do not unfairly discriminate between risks in this state that involve essentially the same exposure to loss and expense elements, and that give due consideration to

(1) the desirability for stability of rate structures;

(2) the necessity of assuring the financial solvency of title insurance companies in periods of economic depression by encouraging growth in assets of title insurance companies in periods of high business activity;

(3) the necessity for assuring a reasonable margin of underwriting and operating profit; and

(4) investment income.

(b) A title insurance company shall adopt basic classifications of policies or contracts of title insurance that shall be used as the basis for rate-making.

###### Sec. 21.66.400.   Disapproval of filings.

(a) If within the waiting period provided for in AS 21.66.370(c) the director finds that a filing does not meet the requirements of this chapter, the director shall send to the title insurance company that made the filing written notice of disapproval of the filing specifying in what respects the director finds the filing fails to meet the requirements of this chapter and stating that the filing may not become effective.

(b) If at any time after the applicable review period provided for in AS 21.66.370(c) the director finds that a filing does not meet the requirements of this chapter, the director shall, before issuing an order of disapproval, hold a hearing upon not less than 10 days written notice, specifying in reasonable detail the matters to be considered at the hearing. Notice of hearing shall be given to each title insurance company that made the filing, and if, after the hearing, the director finds that the filing or a part of the filing does not meet the requirements of this chapter, the director shall issue an order specifying how it is deficient, and when, within a reasonable period thereafter, the filing or a part of it is considered no longer effective. A title insurance company has the right to withdraw a filing or a part of a filing. Copies of the order issued under this section shall be sent to every title insurance company affected. The order does not affect a contract or policy made or issued before the expiration of the period set out in the order.

(c) A person or organization aggrieved with respect to a filing that is in effect may make a written application to the director for a hearing on the filing. The title insurance company that made the filing may not proceed under this subsection. The application shall specify in reasonable detail the grounds to be relied on by the applicant. If the director finds that the application is made in good faith, that the applicant would be aggrieved if the applicant's grounds are established, and that the applicant's grounds otherwise justify holding a hearing, the director shall, within 60 days after receipt of the application, hold a hearing upon not less than 10 days written notice to the applicant and to each title insurance company that made such a filing. If, after the hearing, the director finds that the filing or a part of it does not meet the requirements of this chapter, the director shall issue an order specifying how the filing or a part of it fails to meet the requirements of this chapter, stating when, within a reasonable period after the order is issued, the filing or a part of it is considered no longer effective. Copies of the order shall be sent to the applicant and to every affected title insurance company. The order does not affect a contract or policy made or issued before the expiration of the period set out in the order.

(d) A title insurance company to which the director has issued an order made without a hearing may, within 30 days after notice to it of the order, make a written request to the director for a hearing. The director shall hear the party or parties within 60 days after receipt of the request and shall give not less than 10 days written notice of the time and place of the hearing.

(c) The plan and agreement for the reinsurance must be approved by a vote of not less than two-thirds of each domestic mutual insurer's members voting on the plan or agreement at meetings of members called for the purpose, after reasonable notice and under procedures that the director may approve.  If a life insurer, the right to vote may be limited to members whose policies are other than term or group policies, and have been in effect for more than one year.

(d) If the agreement is for reinsurance in a stock insurer of all or substantially all of the insurance in force of a mutual insurer, the agreement must provide for payment in cash to each member of the insurer entitled thereto of the member's equity in the business reinsured as determined under a fair formula approved by the director, as based upon the reserves, assets, whether or not "admitted" assets, and surplus, if any, of the mutual insurer to be taken over by the stock insurer.

The insurer may, and if a life insurer shall, make a reasonable classification of its policies held by the members, and a formula based upon the classification, for determining the equitable distributive share of each member.  The classification and formula is subject to the approval of the director.

The specific purpose of AS 21.69.650§21.69.690 is to facilitate the continued operation of domestic insurers in the event that a national emergency is caused by an attack on the United States or by a nuclear, atomic, or other disaster which makes it impossible or impracticable for an insurer to conduct its business in strict accord with applicable provisions of law, its bylaws, or its charter.

By a majority vote the emergency board of directors may elect other directors.  If there are not at least three surviving vice presidents, the director of insurance or designated person exercising the powers of director of insurance shall appoint three persons as directors who shall possess all of the powers of the previous board of directors and the powers that are granted herein or by subsequently enacted legislation, and these persons by majority vote may elect other directors.

(2) a person representing the attorney-in-fact or an employee, officer, director, affiliate, or other person having a financial interest in the attorney-in-fact; a person shall be treated as having a financial interest in the attorney-in-fact if the person

(B) has an outstanding loan from the attorney-in-fact; or

(C) earns a commission or other compensation as a producer for the reciprocal insurer.

The contingent liability may be at the rate of not less than one or more than ten times the premium deposit stated in the policy, and the maximum aggregate shall be computed in the manner set out in AS 21.75.190.

(c) Each assessable policy issued by the insurer must contain a statement of the contingent liability.

###### Sec. 21.75.190.   Subscribers' liability on judgment.

(a) An action may not lie against a subscriber upon an obligation claimed against the insurer until a final judgment has been obtained against the insurer and remains unsatisfied for 30 days.

(b) Each subscriber's share of a deficiency for which an assessment is made, but not exceeding the aggregate contingent liability of the subscriber as stated in accordance with AS 21.75.180, shall be computed by applying to the premium earned on the subscriber's policy or policies during the period to be covered by the assessment, the ratio of the total deficiency to the total premiums earned during the period upon all policies subject to the assessment.

(c) In computing the earned premiums for the purposes of this section, the gross premium received by the insurer for the policy shall be used as a base, deducting only charges not recurring upon the renewal or extension of the policy.

(2) an order to show cause why a receiver, conservator, rehabilitator, or liquidator of the insurer should not be appointed is issued while the subscriber's policy is in force or within one year after its termination.

###### Sec. 21.75.220.   Aggregate liability.

A single policy or subscriber as to the policy may not be assessed or charged with an aggregate of contingent liability as to obligations incurred by a domestic reciprocal insurer in any one calendar year, in excess of the amount provided for in the power of attorney or in the subscribers' agreement, computed solely upon premium earned on the policy during that year.

###### Sec. 21.75.230.   Nonassessable policies.

(a) If a reciprocal insurer has a surplus of assets over all liabilities at least equal to the minimum capital and surplus required of a domestic stock insurer authorized to transact like kinds of insurance, upon application of the attorney-in-fact and as approved by the subscribers' advisory committee, the director shall issue a certificate authorizing the insurer to extinguish the contingent liability of subscribers under its policies then in force in this state, and to omit provisions imposing contingent liability in all policies delivered or issued for delivery in this state for as long as all the surplus remains unimpaired.

(b) Upon impairment of the surplus, the director shall immediately revoke the certificate.  The revocation shall not render subject to contingent liability a policy then in force and for the remainder of the period for which the premium has theretofore been paid; but after the revocation a policy may not be issued or renewed without providing for contingent assessment liability of the subscriber.

(c) The director may not authorize a domestic reciprocal insurer to extinguish the contingent liability of any of its subscribers or in any of its policies to be issued, unless it qualifies to and does extinguish the liability of all its subscribers and in all the policies for all kinds of insurance transacted by it.  Except, that if required by the laws of another state in which the insurer is transacting insurance as an authorized insurer, the insurer may issue policies providing for the contingent liability of those subscribers which may acquire the policies in that state, and need not extinguish the contingent liability applicable to policies theretofore in force in that state.

(d) Notwithstanding (a)§(c) of this section, a reciprocal insurer that provides marine insurance may issue policies that are nonassessable.

###### Sec. 21.75.240.   Distribution of savings.

A reciprocal insurer may from time to time return to its subscribers any unused premiums, savings, or credits accruing to their accounts. The distribution may not unfairly discriminate between classes of risks, or policies, or between subscribers, but this does not prevent retrospective rating, or distribution on a retrospective plan, or distribution varying as to classes of subscribers based on the experience of the subscribers.

###### Sec. 21.75.250.   Subscribers' share in assets.

Upon the liquidation of a domestic reciprocal insurer, its assets remaining after discharge of its indebtedness and policy obligations, the return of contributions of the attorney-in-fact or other persons to its surplus made as provided in AS 21.75.140, and the return of an unused premium, savings, or credits then standing on subscribers' account, shall be distributed to its subscribers who were subscribers within the 12 months before the last termination of its certificate of authority, according to a reasonable formula that the director may approve.

###### Sec. 21.75.260.   Merger or conversion.

(a) A domestic reciprocal insurer, upon affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of its subscribers who vote on the merger after due notice and the approval of the director of the terms therefor, may merge with another reciprocal insurer or be converted to a stock or mutual insurer.

(b) The stock or mutual insurer is subject to the same capital or surplus requirements and has the same rights as a like domestic insurer transacting like kinds of insurance.

(c) The director may not approve a plan for a merger or conversion which is inequitable to subscribers, or which, if for conversion to a stock insurer, does not give each subscriber preferential right to acquire stock of the proposed insurer proportionate to the subscriber's interest in the reciprocal insurer as determined in accordance with AS 21.75.250 and a reasonable length of time within which to exercise the right.

###### Sec. 21.75.270.   Financial impairment; determination of insolvency.

(b) If the attorney-in-fact fails to make up the deficiency or to make the assessment within 30 days after the director orders the attorney-in-fact to do so, or if the deficiency is not fully made up within 60 days after the date the assessment was made, the insurer shall be considered insolvent and shall be proceeded against as authorized by this title.

(c) If liquidation of an insurer is ordered, an assessment shall be levied upon the subscriber for an amount, subject to limits as provided by this chapter, that the director determines to be necessary to discharge all liabilities of the insurer, exclusive of any funds contributed by the attorney-in-fact or other persons, but including the reasonable cost of the liquidation.

(d) If liquidation of a domestic reciprocal insurer is ordered, the receiver appointed under the order has a right to recover on behalf of the reciprocal insurer a payment in the form of a bonus, termination settlement, or extraordinary lump-sum compensation adjustment made by the reciprocal insurer or its subscribers to the attorney-in-fact if the distribution or payment is made during the 12 months preceding the order of liquidation, unless it can be shown that the payment was lawful and reasonable and that the reciprocal insurer did not know and, using due diligence, could not have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the reciprocal insurer to fulfill its subscriber's contractual obligation.

(d) An order issued under this section must require an accounting to the court by the receiver.  Accountings must be at the intervals that the court specifies in its order.

(e) Entry of an order of rehabilitation does not constitute an anticipatory breach of contracts of the issuer.

(f) A court in this state before which an action or proceeding is pending in which the insurer is a party or in which the insurer is obligated to defend a party shall stay the action or proceeding when a rehabilitation order against the insurer is entered.  The stay shall be imposed for that period of time necessary for the receiver to obtain proper representation and prepare for further proceedings.

A court of this state shall give full faith and credit to an injunction against the receiver or the company, or against the continuation of an existing action against the receiver or the company, if an injunction is included in an order to liquidate an insurer that is issued under corresponding provisions in another state.  If, in the receiver's judgment, protection of the estate of the insurer necessitates intervention in an action against the insurer that is pending outside this state, the receiver may intervene in the action.  The receiver may defend an action in which the receiver intervenes under this section at the expense of the estate of the insurer.

(i) The receiver may, within two years after an order for liquidation, or within the additional time that applicable law permits, institute an action or proceeding on behalf of the estate of the insurer if the period of limitation applicable to the action or proceeding fixed by law has not expired at the time of the filing of the petition upon which the liquidation order is entered.  If, by agreement, a period of limitation is fixed for instituting a suit or proceeding upon a claim, or for filing a claim, proof of claim, proof of loss, demand, or notice, or if in a judicial or other proceeding a period of limitation is fixed, either in the proceeding or by applicable law, for taking an action, filing a claim or pleading, or doing an act, and if the period had not expired as of the date of the filing of the petition for liquidation, the receiver may, for the benefit of the estate, take an action or do an act, required of or permitted to the insurer, within a period of 180 days after the entry of an order for liquidation, or within a longer period that is shown to the satisfaction of the court not to be unfairly prejudicial to the other party.

(j) A statute of limitations or defense of laches does not run with respect to an action against an insurer between the filing of a petition for liquidation against an insurer and the denial of the petition.  An action against the insurer that might have been commenced when the petition was filed may be commenced for at least 60 days after the petition is denied.

The compensation of the special deputies, counsel, clerks, or assistants and all expenses of taking possession of the insurer and of conducting the proceedings shall be fixed by the receiver, subject to the approval of the court, and shall be paid out of the funds or assets of the insurer.  Within the limits of duties imposed upon them, special deputies shall possess all the powers given to, and in the exercise of those powers shall be subject to all of the duties imposed upon, the receiver with respect to the proceedings.

(g) If it appears to the receiver that there has been a violation of civil or criminal law, or breach of a contractual or fiduciary obligation detrimental to the insurer by an officer, manager, insurance producer, employee, or other person, the receiver may pursue all appropriate legal remedies on behalf of the insurer.

(h) If the receiver determines that reorganization, consolidation, conversion, reinsurance, merger, or other transformation of the insurer is appropriate, the receiver shall prepare a plan to implement the changes.  Upon application of the receiver for approval of the plan, and after the notice and hearings that the court prescribes, the court may either approve or disapprove the plan proposed or may modify it and approve it as modified.  A plan approved under this section must be, in the judgment of the court, fair and equitable to all parties concerned.  If the plan is approved, the receiver shall carry out the plan.  In the case of a life insurer, the plan proposed may include the imposition of liens upon the policies of the company, if all rights of shareholders are first relinquished.  A plan for a life insurer may also propose imposition of a moratorium upon loan and cash surrender rights under policies, for the period, and to the extent, considered necessary.

Amounts advanced for expenses of administration must be repaid to the state out of the first available money of the insurer.

(1) upon a finding that there are sufficient assets of the insurer located in this state to justify the appointment of an ancillary receiver; or

(2) if 10 or more persons resident in this state having claims against the insurer file a petition with the director requesting the appointment of the ancillary receiver.

(b) The domiciliary receiver for the purpose of liquidating an insurer domiciled in a reciprocal state shall be vested by operation of law with the title to all of the property, contracts, and rights of action, and all of the books and records of the insurer located in this state, and has the immediate right to recover balances due from local agents and to obtain possession of any books and records of the insurer found in this state.  The domiciliary receiver shall also be entitled to recover the other assets of the insurer located in this state, except that upon the appointment of an ancillary receiver in this state, the ancillary receiver shall during the ancillary receivership proceedings have the sole right to recover the other assets.  The ancillary receiver shall, as soon as practicable, liquidate from their respective securities those special deposit claims and secured claims that are proved and allowed in the ancillary proceedings in this state, and shall pay the necessary expenses of the proceedings.  The ancillary receiver shall promptly transfer all remaining assets to the domiciliary receiver.

(1) be proved in the domiciliary state as provided by the law of that state; or

(2) if ancillary proceedings have been commenced in this state, be proved in those proceedings; in the event that a claimant elects to prove the claim in this state, the claimant shall file the claim with the ancillary receiver and shall give notice in writing to the receiver in the domiciliary state, either by registered mail or by personal service at least 40 days before the date set for hearing; the notice must contain a concise statement of the amount of the claim, the facts on which the claim is based, and the priorities asserted, if any; if the domiciliary receiver within 30 days after the giving of notice gives notice in writing to the ancillary receiver and to the claimant, either by registered mail or by personal service, of intention to contest the claim, the domiciliary receiver shall be entitled to appear or to be represented in any proceeding in this state involving adjudication of the claim; the final allowance of the claim by the courts of this state shall be accepted as conclusive as to its amount and its priority, if any, against special deposits or other security located in this state.

###### Sec. 21.78.170.   Form of claim.

(a) All claims against an insurer against which delinquency proceedings have been begun must set out in reasonable detail the amount of the claim, or the basis upon which the amount can be ascertained, the facts upon which the claim is based, and the priorities asserted, if any.  The claims shall be verified by the affidavit of the claimant, or someone authorized to act on behalf of the claimant and having knowledge of the facts, and shall be supported by documents that may be material to the claims.

(b) All claims filed in this state shall be filed with the receiver, whether domiciliary or ancillary, in this state, on or before the last date of filing as specified in this chapter.

(c) If a claim is denied in whole or in part by the receiver, written notice of the determination shall be given to the claimant or the claimant's attorney by first class mail at the address shown in the proof of claim.  An objection by the claimant must be filed with the receiver within 60 days after the date of mailing of the notice. If an objection is not filed, the claimant may not object to the determination.

(d) If an objection is filed with the receiver and the receiver does not alter the denial of the claim as a result of the objection, the receiver shall ask the court for a hearing as soon as practicable and give notice of the hearing by first class mail to the claimant or the claimant's attorney and to any other person directly affected, not less than 10 nor more than 30 days before the date of the hearing.

(e) A claim need not be considered or allowed if it does not contain all the information in (a) of this section that might be applicable. The receiver may require that a prescribed form be used and may require that other information and documents be included.

(f) At any time, the receiver may request the claimant to present information or evidence supplementary to that required under (a) of this section, and may take testimony under oath, require production of affidavits or depositions, or otherwise obtain additional information or evidence.

(g) A judgment or order against an insured or the insurer entered after the date of filing of a successful petition for liquidation, and a judgment or order against an insured or the insurer entered at any time by default or by collusion, need not be considered as evidence of liability or the amount of damages.  A judgment or order against an insured or the insurer entered within the four months before the filing of the petition need not be considered evidence of liability or of the amount of damages.

(h) A claim of a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association shall be in the form and contain the substantiation agreed to by the association and the receiver.

###### Sec. 21.78.180.   Priority of certain claims.

(a) In a delinquency proceeding against an insurer domiciled in this state, claims owing to residents of ancillary states shall be preferred claims if like claims are preferred under the laws of this state. Claims owing to residents or nonresidents shall be given equal priority of payment from general assets regardless of where the assets are located.

(b) In a delinquency proceeding against an insurer domiciled in a reciprocal state, claims owing to residents of this state shall be preferred if like claims are preferred by the laws of that state.

(c) The owners of special deposit claims against an insurer for which a receiver is appointed in this or any other state shall be given priority against their several special deposits in accordance with the provisions of the statutes governing the creation and maintenance of the deposits.  If there is a deficiency in a deposit so that the claims secured by it are not fully discharged from it, the claimants may share in the general assets, but the sharing shall be deferred until general creditors and also claimants against other special deposits who have received smaller percentages from their respective special deposits, have been paid percentages of their claims equal to the percentage paid from the special deposit.

(d) The determination of the value of a security held by a secured creditor shall be under the supervision and control of the court, with due regard for recommendations made by the receiver. The value determined must be credited upon the secured claim, and a deficiency must be treated as an unsecured claim.  If the claimant surrenders the security to the receiver, the entire claim shall be allowed as if unsecured.  The value of a security held by a secured creditor must be determined in one of the following ways, as the court directs:

(1) by converting the security into money according to the terms of the agreement under which the security was delivered to the creditor; or

(2) by agreement, arbitration, compromise, or litigation between the creditor and the receiver.

(e) If a creditor, whose claim against an insurer is secured in whole or in part by the undertaking of another person, fails to prove and file that claim, the other person may do so in the creditor's name, and is subrogated to the rights of the creditor, whether the claim was filed by the creditor or by the other person in the creditor's name, to the extent that the other person discharges the undertaking.  In the absence of an agreement with the creditor, the other person is not entitled to a distribution until the amount paid to the creditor on the undertaking plus the distributions paid on the claim from the insurer's estate to the creditor equals the amount of the entire claim of the creditor.  Any excess received by the creditor shall be held by the creditor in trust for the other person.  In this subsection, "other person" does not include a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association.

###### Sec. 21.78.190.   Attachment and garnishment of assets.

During the pendency of delinquency proceedings in this or a reciprocal state, an action or proceeding in the nature of an attachment, garnishment, or execution may not be commenced or maintained in the courts of this state against the delinquent insurer or its assets.  A lien obtained for the action or proceeding within four months before the commencement of the delinquency proceeding or at any time thereafter shall be void as against any rights arising in the delinquency proceeding.

###### Sec. 21.78.200.   Uniform Insurers Liquidation Act.

(a) AS 21.78.020, 21.78.030, 21.78.130§21.78.190 and 21.78.330(1)§(4) and (6)§(12) constitute and may be referred to as the Uniform Insurers Liquidation Act.

(b) The Uniform Insurers Liquidation Act shall be interpreted and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those states that enact it.  To the extent that its provisions when applicable conflict with other provisions of this chapter, the provisions of the Uniform Insurers Liquidation Act shall control.

###### Sec. 21.78.210.   Deposit of money collected.

The money collected by the director in a proceeding under this chapter shall be from time to time deposited in one or more state or national banks, savings banks, and in the case of the insolvency or voluntary liquidation of a depositary that is an institution organized and supervised under the laws of this state, the deposits shall be entitled to priority of payment on an equality with any other priority given by the banking laws of this state. The director may deposit the money or any part of it in a national bank or as a trust fund.

###### Sec. 21.78.220.   Exemption from fees.

The director shall not be required to pay a fee to a public officer in this state for filing, recording, issuing a transcript or certificate, or authenticating a paper or instrument pertaining to the exercise by the director of any of the powers or duties conferred upon the director under this chapter, whether or not the paper or instrument is executed by the director or the director's deputies, employees, or attorneys of record and whether or not it is connected with the commencement of an action or proceeding by or against the director, or with the subsequent conduct of the action or proceeding.

###### Sec. 21.78.230.   Borrowing on pledge of assets.

For the purpose of facilitating the rehabilitation, liquidation, conservation, or dissolution of an insurer under this chapter, the director may, subject to the approval of the court, borrow money and execute, acknowledge, and deliver notes or other evidences of indebtedness and secure the repayment of the same by the mortgage, pledge, assignment, transfer in trust, or hypothecation of any or all of the property, whether real, personal, or mixed, of the insurer, and the director, subject to the approval of the court shall have power to take any and all other action necessary and proper to consummate the loan and to provide for its repayment.  The director, shall be under no obligation personally or in an official capacity to repay a loan made under this section.

###### Sec. 21.78.240.   Date rights fixed on liquidation.

The rights and liabilities of the insurer and of its creditors, policyholders, stockholders, members, subscribers, and all other persons interested in its estate shall, unless otherwise directed by the court, be fixed as of the date on which the order directing the liquidation of the insurer is filed in the office of the clerk of the court that made the order, subject to the provisions of this chapter with respect to the rights of claimants holding contingent claims.

###### Sec. 21.78.250.   Fraudulent transfers before petition.

(a) A transfer made, or an obligation incurred, by an insurer within one year before the filing of a successful petition for rehabilitation or liquidation under this chapter is fraudulent as to then existing and future creditors if made or incurred without fair consideration, or with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud either existing or future creditors.  A transfer made, or an obligation incurred, by an insurer ordered to be rehabilitated or liquidated under this chapter that is fraudulent under this section, may be avoided by the receiver, unless the transfer or obligation was to a person who in good faith is a purchaser, lienor, or obligee for a present fair equivalent value. A purchaser, lienor, or obligee, who in good faith has given a consideration less than fair for the transfer, lien, or obligation may retain the property, lien, or obligation as security for repayment. The court may, on due notice, order a transfer or obligation to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, and in that event, the receiver shall succeed to and may enforce the rights of the purchaser, lienor, or obligee.

(b) A transfer

(1) of property other than real property is considered to be made when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a simple contract could become superior to the rights of the transferee under AS 21.78.252;

(2) of real property is considered to be made when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent bona fide purchaser from the insurer could obtain rights superior to the rights of the transferee;

(3) that creates an equitable lien is not considered to be perfected if there are available means by which a legal lien could be created;

(4) not perfected before the filing of a petition for liquidation is considered to be made immediately before the filing of the successful petition.

(c) The provisions of (b) of this section apply whether or not there is or was a creditor who might have obtained a lien or a person who might have become a bona fide purchaser.

(d) A transaction of the insurer with a reinsurer is considered fraudulent and may be avoided by the receiver under (a) of this section if

(1) the transaction consists of the termination, adjustment, or settlement of a reinsurance contract in which the reinsurer is released from a part of its duty to pay the originally specified share of losses that occurred before the time of the transaction, unless the reinsurer gives a present fair equivalent value for the release; and

(2) a part of the transaction took place within one year before the date of filing of the petition through which the receivership was commenced.

###### Sec. 21.78.251.   Fraudulent transfer after petition.

(a) After a petition for rehabilitation or liquidation has been filed, a transfer of the real property of the insurer made to a person acting in good faith is valid against the receiver if made for a present fair equivalent value, or, if not made for a present fair equivalent value, then to the extent of the present consideration actually paid, for which amount the transferee has a lien on the property transferred. The commencement of a proceeding in rehabilitation or liquidation is constructive notice upon the recording of a copy of the petition for, or order of, rehabilitation or liquidation with the recorder of deeds in the jurisdiction where the real property in question is located. The exercise by a court of the United States, or any state or jurisdiction, to authorize or effect a judicial sale of real property of the insurer in any county or borough in any state is not impaired by the pendency of a proceeding unless the copy is recorded in the county or borough before the consummation of the judicial sale.

(b) After a petition for rehabilitation or liquidation has been filed, and before either the receiver takes possession of the property of the insurer or an order of rehabilitation or liquidation is granted,

(1) a transfer of any of the property of the insurer, other than real property, made to a person acting in good faith is valid against the receiver if made for a present fair equivalent value, or, if not made for a fair equivalent value, then to the extent of the present consideration actually paid, for which amount the transferee has a lien on the property transferred;

(2) a person indebted to the insurer or holding property of the insurer may, if acting in good faith, pay the indebtedness or deliver the property, or any part of it, to the insurer or upon the insurer's order, with the same effect as if the petition were not pending;

(3) a person having actual knowledge of the pending rehabilitation or liquidation is considered not to have acted in good faith;

(4) a person asserting the validity of a transfer under this section has the burden of proof.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a transfer by or on behalf of the insurer after the date of the petition for liquidation by a person other than the receiver is not valid against the receiver.

(d) Nothing in this section impairs the negotiability of currency or negotiable instruments.

###### Sec. 21.78.252.   Voidable preferences and liens.

(a) A transfer of property of an insurer to or for the benefit of a creditor, for or on account of an antecedent debt, made by the insurer within one year before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation under this chapter, the effect of which might be to enable the creditor to obtain a greater percentage of the debt than another creditor of the same class would receive is considered a preference.  If a liquidation order is entered while the insurer is already subject to a rehabilitation order, then a transfer is considered a preference if it is made within one year before the filing of the successful petition for rehabilitation, or within two years before the filing of the successful petition for liquidation, whichever time is shorter.

(b) A preference may be avoided by the receiver if

(1) the insurer was insolvent at the time of the transfer;

(2) the transfer was made within the four months before the filing of the petition;

(3) the creditor receiving it or to be benefited by it or the creditor's agent had, at the time the transfer was made, reasonable cause to believe that the insurer was insolvent or was about to become insolvent; or

(4) the creditor receiving it was an officer, or was an employee, attorney, or other person who acted in that capacity whether or not the creditor held such a position, or was a shareholder holding directly or indirectly more than five percent of a class of an equity security issued by the insurer, or was another person, firm, corporation, association, or group of persons with whom the insurer did not deal at arm's length.

(c) If a preference is voidable, the receiver may recover the property or, if it has been converted, the value of the property, from a person who has received or converted the property, except that if a bona fide purchaser or lienor has given less than fair equivalent value, the person has a lien upon the property to the extent of the consideration actually given by the person. If a preference by way of lien or security title is voidable, the court may, after notice, order the lien or title to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, in event the lien or title passes to the receiver.

(d) The provisions of this subsection apply whether or not there are or were creditors who might have obtained liens or persons who might have become bona fide purchasers.  A transfer

(1) of property other than real property is considered to be made when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a contract could become superior to the rights of the transferee;

(2) of real property is considered to be made when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent bona fide purchaser from the insurer could obtain rights superior to the rights of the transferee;

(3) that creates an equitable lien is not considered to be perfected if there are available means by which a legal lien could be created; or

(4) not perfected before the filing of a petition for liquidation is considered to be made immediately before the filing of the successful petition.

(e) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings

(1) upon a contract is one arising in the ordinary course of a proceeding upon the entry or docketing of a judgment or decree, or upon attachment, garnishment, execution, or like process, whether before, upon, or after judgment or decree and whether before or upon levy; it does not include a lien that, under applicable law, is given a special priority over other liens that are prior in time; or

(2) could become superior to the rights of a transferee, or a purchaser could obtain rights superior to the rights of a transferee within the meaning of (d) of this section, if the consequences would follow only from the lien or purchase itself, or from the lien or purchase followed by a step completely within the control of the respective lienholder or purchaser, with or without the aid of ministerial action by public officials; a lien could not, however, become superior and a person could not create superior rights for the purpose of (d) of this section through acts subsequent to the obtaining of a lien or subsequent to a purchase that requires the agreement or concurrence of a third party or that requires further judicial action or ruling.

(f) A transfer of property for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration that is considered under (d) of this section to be made after the transfer because of delay in perfecting it, does not become a transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if acts required by the applicable law to be performed in order to perfect the transfer against a lien or bona fide purchaser's rights are performed within 21 days, or a period expressly allowed by the law, whichever is less. A transfer to secure a future loan, if a loan is actually made, or a transfer that becomes security for a future loan, has the same effect as a transfer for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration.

(g) If a lien that is considered voidable under (b) of this section has been dissolved by the furnishing of a bond or other obligation, and the bond or other obligation has been indemnified directly or indirectly by the transfer or creation of a lien upon property of an insurer before the filing of a petition under this chapter that results in a liquidation order, the indemnifying transfer or lien is also considered voidable.

(h) The property affected by a lien that is considered voidable under (b) and (g) of this section shall be discharged from the lien, and that property and the indemnifying property transferred to or for the benefit of a surety shall be transferred to the receiver, except that the court may order a lien to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, and the court may direct that a conveyance be executed as is proper or adequate to evidence the title of the receiver.

(i) The court has jurisdiction of a proceeding by the receiver to hear and determine the rights of parties under this section. Reasonable notice of a hearing in the proceeding shall be given to all parties in interest, including the obligee of a releasing bond or other like obligation.  If an order is entered for the recovery of indemnifying property in kind or for the avoidance of an indemnifying lien, the court, upon application of a party in interest, shall in the same proceeding determine the value of the property or lien, and if the value of the property is less than the amount of the indemnity or the amount of the lien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the property or lien upon payment of its value, as determined by the court, to the receiver, within the time that the court fixes.

(j) The liability of a surety under a releasing bond or other obligation shall be discharged to the extent of the value of the indemnifying property recovered or the indemnifying lien avoided by the receiver, or, if the property is retained under (i) of this section, to the extent of the amount paid to the receiver.

(k) If a creditor has been preferred, and afterward in good faith gives the insurer further credit without security of any kind, for property that becomes a part of the insurer's estate, the amount of the new credit remaining unpaid at the time of the petition may be set off against the preference that would otherwise be recoverable from the creditor.

(l) If an insurer, directly or indirectly, within four months before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation under this chapter or at any time in contemplation of a proceeding to liquidate it, pays money or transfers property to an attorney for services rendered or to be rendered, the transaction may be examined by the court on its own motion or shall be examined by the court on petition of the receiver. The transaction may be held valid only to the extent of a reasonable amount to be determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered by the receiver for the benefit of the estate, except that if the attorney is in a position of influence in the insurer or an affiliate, payment of money or the transfer of property to the attorney for services rendered or to be rendered is governed by (b)(4) of this section.

(m) An officer, manager, employee, shareholder, member subscriber, attorney, or other person acting on behalf of an insurer, who knowingly participates in giving a preference even though the person has reasonable cause to believe that the insurer is, or is about to become, insolvent at the time of the preference, is personally liable to the receiver for the amount of the preference.  It is a rebuttable presumption that a preference was given with reasonable cause to believe the insurer is or is about to become insolvent if the transfer was made within four months before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation.

(n) If a person receives property from the insurer, or the benefit of the property, and the preference for the property is found voidable under (b) of this section, the person is personally liable for the value of the property and shall account to the receiver for it.

(o) Nothing in (m) or (n) of this section affects any other claim by the receiver against any person.

###### Sec. 21.78.253.   Claims of holders of void or voidable rights.

(a) A claim of a creditor who has received or acquired a preference, lien, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or encumbrance that is voidable under this chapter may not be allowed unless the creditor surrenders the preference, lien, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or encumbrance.  If the avoidance is affected by a proceeding in which a final judgment has been entered, the claim may not be allowed unless the money is paid or the property is delivered to the receiver within 30 days after the date of the entering of the final judgment, except that the court having jurisdiction over the liquidation may allow further time if there is an appeal or other continuation of the proceeding.

(b) A claim allowable under (a) of this section by reason of avoidance, whether voluntary or involuntary, or a preference, lien, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or encumbrance, may be filed as an excused late filing under AS 21.78.292 if filed within 30 days after the date of avoidance, or within the further time allowed by the court under (a) of this section.

###### Sec. 21.78.260.   Priority of distribution.

The priority of distribution of claims from an insurer's estate is in accordance with the order in which each class of claims is set out in this section. Every claim in each class must be paid in full, or adequate money retained for payment, before the members of the next class may receive payment. A subclass may not be established within a class.  The order of distribution of claims is

(1) class 1:  the costs and expenses of administration during rehabilitation and liquidation, including

(A) the actual and necessary costs preserving or recovering the assets of the insurer;

(B) compensation for all services rendered in the rehabilitation and liquidation;

(C) any necessary filing fees;

(D) the fees and mileage payable to witnesses;

(E) reasonable attorney's fees and other professional services rendered in the rehabilitation and liquidation;

(F) the reasonable expenses of a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association that is handling claims;

(2) class 2:  reasonable compensation to employees for services performed, to the extent that the claim does not exceed two months of monetary compensation and represents payment for services performed within one year before the filing of the petition for liquidation or, if rehabilitation preceded liquidation, within one year before the filing of the petition for rehabilitation; principal officers and directors of the insurer are not entitled to the benefit of this priority except as otherwise approved by the receiver and the court; the priority in this paragraph is in place of any other similar priority that might be authorized by law as to wages or compensation of employees;

(3) class 3:  all claims under policies, including claims of the federal or a state or local government, for losses incurred, including third-party claims, and all claims of a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association; all claims under life insurance and annuity policies, whether for death proceeds, annuity proceeds, or investment values, shall be treated as loss claims; that portion of a loss for which indemnification is provided by other benefits or advantages recovered by the claimant, may not be included in this class, other than benefits or advantages recovered or recoverable in discharge of familial obligations or support, or by way of succession at death, or as proceeds of life insurance, or as gratuities; payment by an employer to an employee may not be treated as a gratuity;

(4) class 4:  claims under nonassessable policies for unearned premium or other premium refunds and claims of general creditors, including claims of ceding and assuming companies under contracts of reinsurance;

(5) class 5: claims of the federal or a state or local government, other than claims under (3) of this section; claims, including those of a government body for a penalty or forfeiture, shall be allowed in this class only to the extent of the pecuniary loss sustained from the act, transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose, along with reasonable and actual costs attributable to it; the remaining portion of the claims are in the class of claims set out in (7) of this section;

(6) class 6:  claims filed late, or any other claims other than claims under (7) and (8) of this section;

(7) class 7:  surplus or contribution notes, or similar obligations, and premium refunds on assessable policies; payments to members of domestic mutual insurance companies shall be limited in accordance with law;

(8) class 8:  the claims of shareholders or other owners, in their capacity as shareholders.

###### Sec. 21.78.270.   Setoffs and counterclaims.

(a) Except as provided in (b) of this section and in AS 21.78.271, a mutual debt or mutual credit between an insurer and another person in connection with an action or proceeding under this chapter shall be set off, and only the balance may be allowed or paid.

(b) A setoff or counterclaim may not be allowed in favor of a person if the obligation of the

(1) insurer to the person would not, at the date of the filing of a petition for liquidation, entitle the person to share as a claimant in the assets of the insurer;

(2) insurer to the person was purchased by or transferred to the person with a view to its being used as a setoff;

(3) person is to pay an assessment levied against the members or subscribers of the insurer, or is to pay a balance upon a subscription to the capital stock of the insurer, or is in any other way in the nature of a capital contribution; or

(4) person is to pay premiums, whether earned or unearned, to the insurer.

###### Sec. 21.78.271.   Recovery of premiums owed.

(a) An

(1) insurance producer, premium finance company, or any other person, other than the insured, responsible for the payment of a premium is obligated to pay an unpaid earned premium due the insurer at the time of the declaration of insolvency, as shown on the records of the insurer; neither a credit nor a setoff is allowed to an insurance producer or premium finance company for an amount advanced to the insurer by the insurance producer or premium finance company on behalf of, but in the absence of a payment by, the insured;

(2) insured is obligated to pay an unpaid earned premium due the insurer at the time of the declaration of insolvency, as shown on the records of the insurer.

(b) If there are grounds for believing that a person has violated this section, the director may initiate proceedings under AS 21.06.170§21.06.230.

(c) Upon a finding of a violation of this section, the director may order a penalty of not more than $1,000 for each act in violation of this section and may suspend or revoke the person's license issued under this title.

###### Sec. 21.78.272.   Reinsurer's liability.

The amount recoverable by the receiver from reinsurers may not be reduced as a result of delinquency proceedings, regardless of a provision in the reinsurance contract or other agreement. Payment made directly to an insured or other creditor does not diminish the reinsurer's obligation to the insurer's estate unless the reinsurance contract provided for direct coverage of a named insured and the payment was made in discharge of that obligation.

###### Sec. 21.78.280.   Special claims.

(a) A contingent and unliquidated claim may not share in a distribution of the assets of an insurer that has been adjudicated to be insolvent by an order made under this chapter, except that the claim shall be considered, if properly presented, and may be allowed to share if

(1) the claim becomes absolute against the insurer on or before the last day for filing claims against the assets of the insurer; or

(2) there is a surplus and the liquidation is, after that, conducted upon the basis that the insurer is solvent.

(b) The claim of a third party that is contingent only on the third party claimant first obtaining a judgment against the insured shall be considered and allowed as if there were not a contingency.

(c) A claim may be allowed even if contingent, if it is filed under AS 21.78.292.  It may be allowed and may participate in all distributions declared after it is filed to the extent that it does not prejudice the orderly administration of the liquidation.

(d) A claim that is due except for the passage of time shall be treated as an absolute claim is treated, except that the claim may be discounted at the legal rate of interest.

(e) A claim made under an employment contract by a director, principal officer, or person in fact performing similar functions or having similar powers, is limited to payment for services rendered before the issuance of an order of rehabilitation or liquidation under this chapter.

###### Sec. 21.78.281.   Special provisions for third-party claims.

(a) If a third party asserts a cause of action against an insured of an insurer in liquidation, the third party may file a claim with the receiver.

(b) Whether or not the third party files a claim, the insured may file a claim on the insured's own behalf in the liquidation. If the insured fails to file a claim by the date for filing claims specified in the order of liquidation or within 60 days after mailing of the notice required by AS 21.78.290, whichever is later, the insured is an unexcused late filer.

(c) The receiver shall make a recommendation to the court under AS 21.78.260 for the allowance of an insured's claim under (b) of this section after consideration of the probable outcome of a pending action against the insured on which the claim is based, the probable damages recoverable in the action, and the probable costs and expenses of defense.  After allowance by the court, the receiver shall withhold from the undistributed assets of the insurer as a reserve the amounts payable on the claim, pending the outcome of litigation and negotiation with the insured.  If appropriate, the receiver may reconsider the claim on the basis of additional information and may amend recommendations made to the court.  The insured shall be afforded the same notice and opportunity to be heard on all changes in the recommendations as in its initial determination.  The court may amend its allowance.  As claims against the insured are settled or barred, the insured shall be paid from the amount withheld the same percentage as was paid on other claims of like property, based on the lesser of (1) the amount actually recovered from the insured by action or paid by agreement plus the reasonable costs and expenses of defense, or (2) the amount allowed on the claims by the court.  After all claims are settled or barred, any sum remaining from the amount withheld reverts to the undistributed assets of the insurer.  Delay in final payment under this subsection is not a reason for unreasonable delay of the final distribution and discharge of the receiver.

(d) If several claims founded upon one policy are filed, whether by third parties or as claims by the insured under this section, and the aggregate allowed amount of the claims to which the same limit of liability in the policy is applicable exceeds that limit, each claim as allowed shall be reduced in the same proportion so that the total amount of the claims equals the policy limit. Claims by the insured shall be evaluated as in (c) of this section.  If an insured's claim is subsequently reduced under (c) of this section, the amount available shall be apportioned ratably among the claims that have been reduced under this subsection.

(e) A claim may not be presented under this section if it is or might be covered by a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association.

###### Sec. 21.78.290.   Notice to creditors and others.

(a) Unless the court directs otherwise, the receiver shall give or cause to be given notice of the liquidation order as soon as possible after the date of the entry of the order of liquidation

(1) by first class mail and telephone, to the insurance director, commissioner, or superintendent of each jurisdiction in which the insurer is doing business;

(2) by first class mail to a guaranty association or a foreign guaranty association that is or that might become obligated as a result of the liquidation;

(3) by first class mail to all insurance agents of the insurer;

(4) by first class mail to all persons known or reasonably expected to have claims against the insurer, including all policyholders, at the person's last known address as indicated by the records of the insurer; and

(5) by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the locale in which the insurer has its principal place of business and in other locations that the receiver considers appropriate.

(b) Notice to potential claimants under (a) of this section must state that a claimant shall file a claim with the receiver, along with the information required by AS 21.78.170(a), on or before the date specified in the notice.  The time specified in the notice may not be less than six months after the date the liquidation order was entered. The liquidation need not require a person claiming a cash surrender value or other investment value in life insurance and annuities to file a claim.  A claimant has a duty to keep the receiver informed of a change of address.

###### Sec. 21.78.291.   Duties of agents.

(a) A person who receives notice in the form prescribed in AS 21.78.290 that an insurer that the person represents as an agent is the subject of a liquidation order, shall, within 15 days after receipt of that notice, give written notice of the liquidation order as provided in this section.  The notice must be in writing and shall be sent by first class mail to each policyholder or other person named in a policy issued through the agent by the insurer, at the last address contained in the agent's records.  A policy is considered to be issued through an agent if the agent has a property interest in the expiration of the policy, or if the agent has had in the agent's possession a copy of the declarations of the policy at any time during the life of the policy, unless the ownership of the expiration of the policy has been transferred to another.  The written notice issued under this section must include the name and address of the insurer, the name and address of the agent, identification of the policy impaired and the nature of the impairment, including termination of coverage as specified in AS 21.78.100(d)§(g). Notice under this section by a general agent satisfies the notice requirement for an agent under contract to the general agent.  Each agent obligated to give notice under this section shall file a report of compliance with the receiver.

(b) An agent failing to give notice or file a report of compliance as required in (a) of this section is, after a proceeding under AS 21.06.070§21.06.240, subject to a penalty of not more than $1,000 and suspension or revocation of the agent's license issued under this title.

(c) The receiver may waive the duties imposed by this section if the receiver determines that other notice to policyholders of the insurer under liquidation is adequate.

###### Sec. 21.78.292.   Filing of claims.

(a) Proof of a claim shall be filed with the receiver, in the form required by AS 21.78.170, on or before the last day for filing specified in the notice required under this chapter, except that proof of a claim for cash surrender value or other investment value in life insurance and annuities need not be filed unless expressly required by the receiver.

(b) The receiver may, under the following circumstances, permit a claimant who makes a late filing to share in distributions, whether past or future, as if the claim was not late, to the extent that a payment does not prejudice the orderly administration of the liquidation:

(1) the existence of the claim was not known to the claimant and the claim was filed as promptly as was reasonably possible after learning of it;

(2) a transfer to a creditor was avoided under this chapter, or was voluntarily surrendered under this chapter, and the filing satisfies the conditions of AS 21.78.253; or

(3) the valuation under AS 21.78.180(d), of security held by a secured creditor, shows a deficiency, a claim for which is filed within 30 days after the valuation.

(c) The receiver shall permit late-filed claims to share in distributions, whether past or future, as if they were not late, if the claims are claims of a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association for reimbursement of covered claims paid or expenses incurred, or both, after the last day for filing, and if the payments were made and expenses were incurred as provided by law.

(d) The receiver may consider a claim that is filed late and that is not covered by (b) of this section and may permit it to receive distributions that are subsequently declared on any claims of the same or lower priority, if the payment does not prejudice the orderly administration of the liquidation. The late-filing claimant shall receive, at each distribution, the same percentage of the amount allowed on the claim as is then being paid to claimants of a lower priority, until the claim has been paid in full.

###### Sec. 21.78.293.   Receiver's recommendation to the court.

(a) The receiver shall review all claims filed in the liquidation and shall make further investigation that the receiver considers necessary.  The receiver may compound, compromise, or negotiate the amount for which a claim will be recommended to the court, unless the receiver is required by law to accept a claim as settled by a person or organization, including a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association. As soon as practicable, the receiver shall present to the court a report of the claims against the insurer, along with the receiver's recommendations.  The report must include the name and address of each claimant and the amount of the claim finally recommended, if any.  If the insurer has issued annuities or life insurance policies, the receiver shall report the persons to whom, according to the records of the insurer, amounts are owed as cash surrender values or other investment values, and the amounts owed.

(b) The court shall review and adopt the receiver's report on claims by approving those claims that are supported by substantial evidence and disapproving allowed claims that are not supported by substantial evidence. Claims in a report that are not disapproved by the court within a period of 120 days following submission by the receiver shall be treated by the receiver as allowed claims.

###### Sec. 21.78.294.   Distribution of assets.

Under the direction of the court, the receiver shall distribute assets in a manner that will assure the proper recognition of priorities and a reasonable balance between the expeditious completion of the liquidation and the protection of unliquidated and undetermined claims, including third-party claims.  Distribution of assets in kind may be made at valuations set by agreement between the receiver and the creditor, and approved by the court.

###### Sec. 21.78.295.   Unclaimed and withheld money.

(a) All unclaimed money that is subject to distribution and remains in the receiver's hands when the receiver is ready to apply to the court for discharge, including the amount distributable to a creditor, shareholder, member, or other person who is unknown and cannot be found, shall be deposited with the Department of Revenue and shall be paid, without interest, to the person entitled to receive it or to the person's legal representative upon proof satisfactory to the Department of Revenue of the person's right to it. Notwithstanding the provisions of AS 34.45, an amount on deposit with the Department of Revenue that is not claimed within six years after the discharge of the receiver is considered to be abandoned and shall, without further proceedings, be deposited in the general fund.

(b) All money retained for claims described in AS 21.78.280 and not distributed, shall, upon discharge of the receiver, be deposited with the Department of Revenue and paid in accordance with AS 21.78.260.  Any amount remaining that, under AS 21.78.260, would revert to the undistributed assets of the insurer, shall be transferred to the Department of Revenue.  Remaining amounts become the property of the state under (a) of this section, unless the director, in the director's discretion, petitions the court to reopen the liquidation under AS 21.78.297.

###### Sec. 21.78.296.   Termination of proceedings.

(a) When all assets justifying the expense of collection and distribution have been collected and distributed under this chapter, the receiver shall apply to the court for discharge. The court may grant the discharge and make additional orders the court considers appropriate.

(b) Any other person may apply to the court at any time for an order under (a) of this section.  If the application is denied, the applicant shall pay the receiver's costs and expenses incurred in resisting the application, including a reasonable attorney fee.

###### Sec. 21.78.297.   Reopening liquidation.

After the liquidation proceeding has been terminated and the receiver discharged, the director or an interested party may at any time petition the court to reopen the proceedings for good cause, including the discovery of additional assets.  If the court is satisfied that there is justification for reopening, it shall order the liquidation proceeding reopened.

###### Sec. 21.78.298.   Disposition of records during and after termination of liquidation.

If it appears to the director that the records of an insurer that is in the process of liquidation, or is completely liquidated, are no longer useful, the director may recommend to the court, and the court shall direct, which records should be retained for future reference and which should be destroyed.

###### Sec. 21.78.300.   Report and petition for assessment.

Within three years after the date of the entry of an order of rehabilitation or liquidation of a domestic mutual insurer or a domestic reciprocal insurer, the director may make and file a report and petition to the court setting out

(1) the reasonable value of the assets of the insurer;

(2) the liabilities of the insurer to the extent thus far ascertained by the director;

(3) the aggregate amount of the assessment, if any, that the director considers reasonably necessary to pay all claims, the costs and expenses of the collection of the assessments, and the costs and expenses of the delinquency proceedings in full;

(4) other information relative to the affairs or property of the insurer that the director considers material.

###### Sec. 21.78.310.   Order and levy of assessment.

(a) Upon the filing and reading of the report and petition provided for in AS 21.78.300, the court, ex parte, may order the director to assess all members or subscribers of the insurer who may be subject to the assessment, in the aggregate amount the court finds reasonably necessary to pay all valid claims as may be timely filed and proved in the delinquency proceedings, together with the costs and expenses of levying and collecting assessments and the costs and expenses of the delinquency proceedings in full. The order must require the director to assess each member or subscriber for a proportion of the aggregate assessment, according to the reasonable classification of the members or subscribers and formula that may be made by the director and approved by the court.

(b) The court may order additional assessments upon the filing and reading of any amendment or supplement to the report and petition referred to in (a) of this section, if the amendment or supplement is filed within three years after the date of the entry of the order of rehabilitation or liquidation.

(c) After the entry of the order to levy and assess members or subscribers of an insurer referred to in (a) or (b) of this section, the director shall levy and assess members or subscribers in accordance with the order.

(d) The total of all assessments against a member or subscriber with respect to a policy, whether levied under this chapter or under another provision of this title, shall be for no greater amount than that specified in the policy or policies of the member or subscriber and as limited under this title, except as to a policy that was issued at a rate of premium below the minimum rate lawfully permitted for the risk insured, in which event the assessment against the policyholder shall be upon the basis of the minimum rate for the risk.

(e) An assessment may not be levied against a member or subscriber with respect to a nonassessable policy issued in accordance with this title, when the insurer has a nonrevoked authority to issue nonassessable policies.

###### Sec. 21.78.320.   Assessment prima facie correct.

(a) An assessment of a subscriber or member of an insurer made by the director under the order of court fixing the aggregate amount of the assessment against all members or subscribers and approving the classification and formula made by the director under AS 21.78.310 shall be prima facie correct.

(b) Each member or subscriber shall be notified of the amount of assessment to be paid by the member or subscriber by written notice mailed to the address of the member or subscriber last of record with the insurer.  Failure of the member or subscriber to receive the notice so mailed, within the time specified therein for the payment of the assessment or at all, shall be no defense in a proceeding to collect the assessment.

(c) If the member or subscriber fails to pay the assessment within the period specified in the notice, which period may not be less than 20 days after mailing, the director may obtain an order in the delinquency proceedings requiring the member or subscriber to show cause at a time and place fixed by the court why judgment should not be entered against the member or subscriber for the amount of the assessment together with all costs, and a copy of the order and a copy of the petition shall be served upon the member or subscriber within the time and in the manner designated in the order.

(d) If the subscriber or member after due service of a copy of the order and petition referred to in (c) of this section is made upon the member or subscriber

(1) fails to appear at the time and place specified in the order, judgment shall be entered against the member or subscriber as prayed for in the petition; or

(2) appears in the manner and form required by law in response to the order, the court shall hear and determine the matter and enter a judgment in accordance with its decision.

(e) The director may collect the assessment through any other lawful means.

###### Sec. 21.78.325.   Recovery from affiliates.

(a) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a domestic insurer has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order has a right to recover on behalf of the insurer (1) from a parent corporation or holding company or person or affiliate who otherwise controlled the insurer, the amount of distributions, other than a distribution of shares of the same class of stock, paid by the insurer on the insurer's capital stock; or (2) a payment in the form of a bonus, termination settlement, or extraordinary lump sum salary adjustment made by the insurer or the insurer's subsidiary to a director, officer, or employee. If the distribution or payment is made during the 12 months preceding the petition for liquidation, conservation, or rehabilitation, the distribution or payment is subject to the limitations of (b)§(d) of this section.

(b) A distribution may not be recovered if the parent or affiliate shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.

(c) A person who was a parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate at the time the distribution was paid is liable up to the amount of the distribution or payment that the person received. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distribution, the persons are jointly and severally liable.

(d) The maximum amount recoverable under this section is the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer and to reimburse any guaranty funds that expended funds or incurred expenses or may expend funds or may incur expenses in connection with the impaired or insolvent insurer.

(e) To the extent that a person liable under (c) of this section is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay a claim due under (c) of this section, the person's parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled the parent corporation or holding company at the time the distribution was paid is jointly and severally liable for the resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the parent corporation or holding company or the person who otherwise controlled the parent corporation or holding company.

To provide this protection, an association of member insurers is created under AS 21.79.040 to pay benefits and continue coverages as limited by this chapter, and members of the association are subject to assessment to provide funds to carry out the purpose of this chapter.

The costs of the association's obligations under this chapter may be met by the use of assets attributable to covered policies or reimbursed to the association under its subrogation and assignment rights.

(c) In providing coverage required under AS 21.79.060, the association may not be required to guarantee, assume, reissue, reinsure, or perform, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reissued, reinsured, or performed, the contractual obligations of an insolvent or impaired insurer under a covered policy or contract when the obligations do not materially affect the economic values or economic benefits of the covered policy or contract.

(e) For purposes of this chapter, benefits provided by a long-term care rider to a life insurance policy or annuity contract will be considered the same type of benefits as the base life insurance policy or annuity contract to which the rider relates.

###### Sec. 21.79.030.   Construction.

(a) This chapter shall be construed to achieve the purposes set out in AS 21.79.010.

(b) This chapter is intended to provide coverage to a person who is a resident of this state and, in special circumstances, to a nonresident. In order to avoid duplicate coverage, if a person who would otherwise receive coverage under this chapter is provided coverage under the law of any other state, the person may not be provided coverage under this chapter. In determining the application of the provisions of this subsection, in situations where a person could be covered by the association of more than one state, whether as an owner, payee, beneficiary, or assignee, this chapter shall be construed in conjunction with other state laws to result in coverage by only one association.

###### Sec. 21.79.040.   Association established.

(a) There is established as a nonprofit legal entity the Alaska Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association. Each member insurer shall be a member of the association as a condition of the insurer's authority to transact insurance, a hospital or medical service corporation business, or a health maintenance organization business in this state. The association shall perform its functions under a plan of operation established and approved under AS 21.79.080 and shall exercise its powers through the Board of Governors established under AS 21.79.050.

(A) life insurance account;

(B) annuity account that must include annuity contracts owned by a governmental retirement benefit plan, or its trustee, qualified under 26 U.S.C. 401, 26 U.S.C. 403(b), or 26 U.S.C. 457 (Internal Revenue Code), but that otherwise excludes unallocated annuities; and

(C) unallocated annuity account that must exclude contracts owned by a governmental retirement benefit plan, or its trustee, qualified under 26 U.S.C. 401, 26 U.S.C. 403(b), or 26 U.S.C. 457 (Internal Revenue Code).

(b) The association is under the supervision of the director and is subject to the insurance laws of the state.  Except as provided in AS 21.79.110(b), meetings or records of the association may be open to the public upon majority vote of the Board of Governors of the association.

###### Sec. 21.79.050.   Board of governors.

(a) The Board of Governors of the association consists of not less than seven nor more than 11 representatives of member insurers. The director may appoint two individuals as members of the board to represent the public. Terms of office for board members shall be established in the plan of operation submitted under AS 21.79.080. Member insurers shall select the insurer board members, subject to the approval of the director. A vacancy in a board membership held by an insurer member shall be filled for the unexpired term by a majority vote of the remaining board members, subject to the approval of the director. A vacancy in a board membership held by a representative of the public shall be filled by the director. A board member who represents the public may not be an officer, director, or employee of an insurer, hospital or medical service corporation, or health maintenance organization and may not be engaged in the business of insurance.

(b) Before the director approves the selection of an insurer board member, the director shall consider whether all member insurers are fairly represented on the board.

(c) A board member is not entitled to compensation by the association. However, a board member may be reimbursed from the assets of the association for expenses incurred while performing duties as a member of the board.

###### Sec. 21.79.060.   Powers and duties of the association.

(a) If a member insurer becomes impaired, the association may, with the approval of the director and subject to any conditions imposed by the association that do not impair the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer,

(1) guarantee, assume, reissue, reinsure, or provide for the guarantee, assumption, reissuance, or reinsurance of the policies or contracts of the impaired insurer; and

(2) provide money, pledges, loans, notes, guarantees, or other means that are necessary to act under (1) of this subsection and to assure payment of the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer until those obligations are guaranteed, reinsured, or assumed.

(b) If a member insurer becomes insolvent, the association shall, in its discretion and with the approval of the director,

(1) guarantee, assume, reissue, reinsure, or provide for the guarantee, assumption, reissuance, or reinsurance of the covered policies or contracts of the insolvent insurer, or otherwise assure payment of the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer; and provide money, pledges, loans, notes, guarantees, or other means that are necessary to discharge the association's duties under this section; or

(2)  provide benefits and coverage in accordance with the following provisions:

(A)  with respect to policies and contracts, assure payment of benefits that would have been payable under a policy or contract of the insolvent insurer for claims incurred with respect to

(i)  a group policy or contract, not later than the earlier of the next renewal date under the policy or contract or 45 days, but in no event less than 30 days, after the date on which the association becomes obligated with respect to the policy or contract;

(ii)  an individual policy, contract, or annuity, not later than the earlier of the next renewal date, if any, under the policy or contract or one year, but in no event less than 30 days, after the date on which the association becomes obligated with respect to the policy or contract;

(B)  with respect to an individual or group policy or contract, make a diligent effort to provide a known insured, an enrollee, an annuitant, or a group policy owner or group contract owner 30 days' notice of the termination of the benefits provided;

(C)  with respect to an individual policy or contract, make available to each known insured, enrollee, or annuitant, or owner if other than an insured, enrollee, or annuitant, and with respect to an individual who was formerly an insured, enrollee, or annuitant under a group policy or contract who is not eligible for replacement group coverage, make available substitute coverage on an individual basis under (D) of this paragraph, if the insured, enrollee, or annuitant had a right under law or under the terminated policy or contract to convert coverage to individual coverage or to continue an individual policy or contract in force until a specified age, or for a specific time during which the insurer, hospital or medical service corporation, or health maintenance organization did not have the unilateral right to make changes in any provision of the policy or contract or had a right only to make changes in premium by class;

(D)  in providing the substitute coverage under (C) of this paragraph, the association

(i)  shall offer either to reissue the terminated coverage or to issue an alternate policy or contract at actuarially justified rates;

(ii)  shall offer an alternative or reissued policy or contract without requiring evidence of insurability and may not provide for a waiting period or exclusion that would not have applied under the terminated policy or contract; and

(iii)  may reinsure an alternative or reissued policy or contract;

(E)  an alternative policy or contract must

(i)  if adopted by the association, be subject to the approval of the director; the association may adopt alternative policies or contracts of various types for future issuance without regard to a particular impairment or insolvency;

(ii)  contain at least the minimum statutory provisions required in the state and provide benefits that may not be unreasonable in relation to the premium charged; the association shall set the premium under a table of rates that it shall adopt; the premium must reflect the amount of insurance to be provided and the age and class of risk of each insured, but may not reflect changes in the health of the insured after the original policy or contract was last underwritten;

(iii)  if issued by the association, provide coverage of a type similar to that of the policy or contract issued by the impaired or insolvent insurer, as determined by the association;

(F)  if the association elects to reissue terminated coverage at a premium rate different from that charged under the terminated policy or contract, the premium shall be actuarially justified and set by the association according to the amount of insurance or coverage provided and the age and class of risk;

(G)  the association's obligations with respect to coverage under a policy or contract of an impaired or insolvent insurer or under a reissued or alternative policy or contract stop on the date the coverage, policy, or contract is replaced by another similar policy or contract by the policy or contract owner, the insured, the enrollee, or the association;

(H)  when proceeding under this subsection with respect to a policy or contract carrying guaranteed minimum interest rates, the association shall assure the payment or crediting of a rate of interest consistent with AS 21.79.020(c)(4).

(c) Nonpayment of a premium within 31 days after the date required under the terms of a guaranteed, assumed, alternative or reissued policy or contract or substitute coverage terminates the obligations of the association under the policy, contract, or coverage except with respect to the claims incurred or the net cash surrender value that may be due under the provisions of this chapter.

(d) A premium due for coverage after entry of an order of liquidation of an insolvent insurer belongs to and is payable at the direction of the association. Upon request of a liquidator of an insolvent insurer, the association shall provide a report to the liquidator regarding the premium collected by the association. The association is liable for unearned premiums due to a policy or contract owner arising after the entry of the order.

(e) The protection provided by this chapter does not apply if guaranty protection is provided to residents of this state by the laws of another state or jurisdiction that is the domicile of the impaired or insolvent insurer.

(f) In carrying out its duties under (b) of this section, the association may impose a permanent policy or contract lien under a guarantee, assumption, or reinsurance agreement if the policy or contract lien is approved by a court and the association finds that

(1) the amount that may be assessed under this chapter is less than the amount needed to assure full and prompt performance of the association's duties under this chapter; or

(2) the economic or financial condition that affects member insurers is sufficiently adverse that the imposition of a policy or contract lien is in the public interest.

(g) In carrying out its duties under (b) of this section, the association may request the superior court to impose an injunction against the payment of a cash value and policy loan, or the exercise of another right to withdraw funds held in connection with a policy or contract, in addition to a contractual provision for deferral of a cash or policy loan value. In addition, if the receivership court imposes an injunction on payment of cash values or policy loans or on any other right to withdraw funds of an impaired or insolvent insurer held in conjunction with a policy or contract, the association may defer payment of cash values, policy loans, or other rights for the period of the injunction, except for claims covered by the association to be paid as required by a hardship procedure established by the liquidator or rehabilitator and approved by the receivership court.

(h) If the association fails to take action under (b) of this section within a reasonable period of time after a member insurer becomes insolvent, the director shall assume the powers of the association under (b) of this section.

(i) If requested by the director, the association may assist and advise the director concerning rehabilitation, payment of claims, continuance of coverage, or the performance of other contractual obligations of an impaired or insolvent insurer.

(j) The association is entitled to appear or intervene in a court or agency proceeding in this state involving an impaired or insolvent insurer that the association is or may be obligated to or involving a person or property against which the association may have rights. The standing conferred by this subsection extends to all matters germane to the powers and duties of the association, including proposals to reinsure or guarantee a covered policy of the impaired or insolvent insurer and the determination of a covered policy and a contractual obligation. The association also has the right to appear or intervene before a court or agency in another state in a proceeding involving an impaired or insolvent insurer that the association is or may be obligated to or involving a person or property against which the association may have rights.

(k) A person who receives benefits under this chapter is considered to have assigned the rights under, and any cause of action against a person for losses arising under, resulting from, or otherwise relating to, the covered policy to the association to the extent of the benefits received under this chapter, whether the benefits are payment of or on account of contractual obligations, continuations of coverage, or provisions of substitute or alternative policies, contracts, or coverages. The association may require an assignment to the association of those rights by the enrollee, payee, policy or contract owner, beneficiary, insured, or annuitant before a person receives the rights or benefits conferred by this chapter. The priority of the association's subrogation right to the assets of the insolvent insurer is the same as the priority of the person entitled to benefits under this chapter. In addition to the rights described in this subsection, the association has common law rights of subrogation and any other equitable or legal remedy that would have been available to the impaired or insolvent insurer or owner, beneficiary, enrollee, or payee of a policy or contract with respect to the policy or contract. These rights include, in the case of a structured settlement annuity, the rights of the enrollee, owner, beneficiary, or payee of the annuity, to the extent of benefits received under this chapter, against a person originally or by succession responsible for the losses arising from the personal injury relating to the annuity or annuity payment, except for a person responsible solely by reason of being an assignee in respect to a qualified assignment under 26 U.S.C. 130 (Internal Revenue Code). If the provisions of this subsection are invalid with respect to a person or claim, the amount payable by the association with respect to the related coverage obligation shall be reduced by the amount realized by another person from the person or claim covered by the association. If the association has provided benefits with respect to a covered obligation and a person recovers amounts to which the association has rights as described in this subsection, the person recovering the amounts shall pay to the association the portion of the recovery attributable to the policies or contracts covered by the association.

(l) In addition to the rights and powers otherwise established in this chapter, the association may

(1) enter into contracts that are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions of this chapter;

(2) sue or be sued, and take legal action necessary or proper for recovery of an unpaid assessment under AS 21.79.070 or settlement of a claim or potential claim;

(3) borrow money to carry out the purposes of this chapter; notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the association not in default are legal investments for domestic member insurers and may be carried as admitted assets;

(4) employ or retain those persons necessary to handle the financial transactions of the association and other functions under this chapter;

(5) negotiate and contract with a liquidator, rehabilitator, conservator, or ancillary receiver to carry out the powers and duties of the association;

(6) exercise, for the purposes of this chapter and to the extent approved by the director, the powers of a domestic life insurer, health insurer, hospital or medical service corporation, or health maintenance organization; however, the association may not issue policies or contracts other than those issued to perform its obligations under this chapter;

(7) take legal action to prevent or recover the payment of improper claims;

(8) join an organization of one or more other state associations with similar purposes;

(9) determine, using reasonable business judgment, the means by which the association is to provide the benefits of this chapter in an economical and efficient manner;

(10) request information from a person seeking coverage from the association in order to determine the obligations of the association under this chapter; a person receiving a request under this paragraph shall promptly comply with the request;

(11) request information from a member insurer in order to aid in the exercise of a power under this section; a member insurer receiving a request under this paragraph shall promptly comply with the request;

(12) unless prohibited by law, in accordance with the terms of the policy or contract, file for actuarially justified rates or premium increases for a policy or contract for which it provides coverage under this chapter; and

(13) perform all other acts necessary or proper to implement this chapter.

(m) When the association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits of this chapter to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association's obligations under this chapter, the covered person is not entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement.

(n) In carrying out its duties in connection with guaranteeing, assuming, or reinsuring a policy or contract, the association may, subject to approval of the receivership court, issue substitute coverage for a policy or contract that provides an interest rate, crediting rate, or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value by issuing an alternative policy or contract under the following provisions:

(1) in place of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contract provides for

(A) a fixed interest rate;

(B) payment of dividends with minimum guarantees; or

(C) a different method for calculating interest or changes in value;

(2) there is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period, or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract; and

(3) the alternative policy or contract is substantially similar to the replaced policy or contract in all other material terms.

(o) The rights and obligations of the association, reinsurers of an insolvent insurer, and the receiver of an insolvent insurer are governed by the following provisions:

(1) not later than 180 days after the date of the order of liquidation, the association may elect to succeed to the rights and obligations of the ceding member insurer that relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, in each case under any one or more reinsurance contracts entered into by the insolvent insurer and its reinsurers and selected by the association; an assumption is effective as of the date of the order of liquidation; the election shall be effected by the association or the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations on the association's behalf by written notice, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurers; to facilitate the earliest practicable decision about whether to assume any of the contracts of reinsurance and to protect the financial position of the estate, as soon as possible after commencement of formal delinquency proceedings, the receiver and each reinsurer of the ceding member insurer shall make available, upon request, to the association or the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations on the association's behalf

(A) copies of in-force contracts of reinsurance and all related files and records relevant to the determination of whether those contracts should be assumed; and

(B) notices of any defaults under the reinsurance contracts or any known event or condition that, with the passage of time, could become a default under the reinsurance contracts;

(2) as to reinsurance contracts assumed by the association under this subsection,

(A) the association is responsible for all unpaid premiums due under the reinsurance contracts for periods before, on, and after the date of the order of liquidation and is responsible for the performance of all other obligations to be performed on and after the date of the order of liquidation in each case that relates to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association; the association may charge policies, contracts, or annuities covered in part by the association, through reasonable allocation methods, the costs for reinsurance in excess of the obligations of the association and shall provide notice and an accounting of those charges to the liquidator;

(B) the association is entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods on and after the date of the order of liquidation and that relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, if, upon receiving those amounts, the association is obliged to pay to the beneficiary, under the policy, contract, or annuity for which the amounts were paid, a portion of the amount equal to the lesser of the amount

(i) received by the association; and

(ii) by which the amount received by the association exceeds the amount equal to the benefits paid by the association under the policy, contract, or annuity, less the amount retained by the insurer applicable to the loss or event;

(C) not later than 30 days after the association's election, the association and each reinsurer under contracts assumed by the association shall calculate the net balance due to or from the association under each reinsurance contract as of the election date with respect to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association; in making the calculation, the association and reinsurer shall give full credit to all items paid by either the member insurer or its receiver or the reinsurer before the election date; the reinsurer shall pay the receiver any amounts due for losses or events before the date of the order of liquidation, subject to any set-off for premiums unpaid for periods before the date, and the association or reinsurer shall pay any remaining balance due the other, in each case, not later than five days after the completion of the calculation; a dispute over the amount due to the association or reinsurer shall be resolved by arbitration under the terms of the affected reinsurance contract or, if the contract does not contain an arbitration clause, as otherwise provided by law; if the receiver has received an amount due to the association under (B) of this paragraph, the receiver shall remit the amount to the association as promptly as practicable;

(D) if the association or receiver on the association's behalf, not later than 60 days after the election date, pays the unpaid premiums due for periods both before and after the election date that relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, the reinsurer may not terminate the reinsurance contracts for failure to pay premium insofar as the reinsurance contracts relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, and may not set off an unpaid amount due under another contract or an unpaid amount due from a party other than the association against amounts due to the association;

(3) during the period from the date of the order of liquidation until the election date, or, if the election date does not occur, until 180 days after the date of the order of liquidation,

(A) neither the association nor the reinsurer shall have any rights or obligations under reinsurance contracts that the association has the right to assume, whether for periods before, on, or after the date of the order of liquidation; and

(B) the reinsurer, the receiver, and the association shall, to the extent practicable, provide to each other data and records reasonably requested, if, once the association has elected to assume a reinsurance contract, the parties' rights and obligations are governed by this subsection;

(4) if the association does not elect to assume a reinsurance contract by the election date, the association does not have rights or obligations, in each case for periods before, on, and after the date of the order of liquidation, with respect to the reinsurance contract;

(E) applies to a reinsurance agreement covering property or casualty risks.

###### Sec. 21.79.070.   Assessments.

(a) For the purpose of providing funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the Board of Governors shall by resolution assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at a time and for an amount that the board finds necessary. Assessments are authorized when a resolution is passed and are due not less than 30 days after prior written notice to the member insurers and accrue interest at 10 percent a year from the date payment is due. Authorized assessments become called when notice is mailed by the association to member insurers.

(b) There shall be two assessments as follows:

(1) class A assessments shall be authorized and called for the purpose of meeting administrative and legal costs and other expenses and examinations conducted under the authority of AS 21.79.060; class A assessments may be authorized and called whether or not related to a particular impaired or insolvent insurer;

(2) class B assessments shall be authorized and called only as necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association with regard to an impaired or an insolvent insurer.

(c) The amount of a class A assessment shall be determined by the board and may be made on a pro rata or non pro rata basis. If a pro rata assessment is made, the board may provide that it be credited against future class B assessments. The amount of a class B assessment, except for assessments related to long-term care insurance, shall be allocated for assessment purposes between the accounts and among the subaccounts of the life insurance and annuity account under an allocation formula that may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or by another standard determined by the board in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances. The amount of the class B assessment for long-term care insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer shall be allocated according to a methodology included in the association's plan of operation approved by the director. The methodology must provide for 50 percent of the assessment to be allocated to accident and health member insurers and 50 percent to be allocated to life and annuity member insurers.

(d) Class B assessments shall be based on the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each account in proportion to the premiums received on business in this state by all assessed member insurers during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the insolvency or impairment occurred.

(e) The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, a payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. The amount by which an assessment against a member insurer is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in (c) of this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral are removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were deferred under a repayment plan approved by the association.

(f) Except as provided in this subsection, the total of all assessments on a member insurer for each subaccount of the life and annuity account and for the health account may not in any one calendar year exceed two percent of the member insurer's average annual premiums received in this state on policies or contracts covered by the account or subaccount during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the member insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer. If two or more assessments are authorized in one calendar year with respect to member insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation imposed under this subsection shall be limited to the highest of the average annual premiums during the preceding three calendar years for the applicable subaccount or account as calculated under this section. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in an account, does not provide in any one year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon as permitted by this chapter.

(g) The board may provide in the plan of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one or more impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be insufficient to cover anticipated claims.

(h) If the maximum assessment for a subaccount of the life and annuity account in any one year does not provide an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the board shall, as provided under (d) of this section, access all subaccounts of the life and annuity account for the necessary additional amount, subject to the assessment limit provided in (f) of this section.

(i) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer may not be authorized or called until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. Classification of assessments under (b) of this section and computation of assessments under this section shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible. The association shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called within 180 days after the assessment is authorized.

(j) The board may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains, and income from investments. A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for future losses claims.

(k) A member insurer may, in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance, hospital or medical service corporation business, or health maintenance organization business within the scope of this chapter, consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this chapter.

(l) A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assessment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set out in the notice provided by the association. The payment shall be available to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or any subsequent appeal. If a payment is made under protest, payment must be accompanied by a statement in writing that the payment is made under protest and setting out a brief statement of the grounds for the protest. Within 60 days following the payment of an assessment under protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member insurer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is required to resolve the issues raised by the protest. Within 30 days after a final decision has been made, the association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of that final decision. Within 60 days after receipt of notice of the final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final action to the director. In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the association may refer protests to the director for a final decision with or without recommendation from the association. If a protest or appeal on an assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member insurer. Interest on a refund due a protesting member insurer shall be paid at the rate actually earned by the association.

###### Sec. 21.79.080.   Plan of operation.

(a) The association shall submit to the director a plan of operation and any amendments to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the association. The plan of operation and any amendments take effect on the written approval of the plan by the director or 30 days after receipt by the director if not disapproved by the director.

(b) If the association fails to submit suitable amendments to the plan, the director shall, after notice and hearing, adopt regulations to implement this chapter. These regulations remain in effect until amended or repealed by the director.

(c) A member insurer shall comply with the plan of operation. The plan of operation must

(1) establish procedures for handling assets of the association;

(d) The plan of operation may delegate the powers and duties of the association, other than those under AS 21.79.060(l)(3) and 21.79.070, to a corporation or other organization performing functions similar to those of the association, or its equivalent, in two or more states.  The association shall reimburse the corporation or organization for a payment made for the association and for performing a function of the association.  A delegation under this subsection takes effect only with the approval of the board and the director.

###### Sec. 21.79.090.   Powers and duties of the director.

(a) Upon request of the board, the director shall provide the association with a statement of the premiums in the appropriate states for each member insurer.

(b) The director may

(1) after notice and hearing as provided in AS 21.06.180§21.06.230, suspend or revoke the certificate of authority to transact business in this state of a member insurer that fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation;

(2) levy a penalty on a member insurer that fails to comply with the plan of operation; or

(3) levy a penalty on a member insurer that fails to pay an assessment when due; if the unpaid assessment is more than $2,000, the penalty may not exceed five percent of the unpaid assessment a month or be less than $100 a month; if the unpaid assessment is $2,000 or less, the penalty is $100 a month.

(c) A final action of the board or the association may be appealed to the director by a member insurer if the appeal is taken not later than 60 days after the date the notice of the action is mailed. Final action or order of the director may be reviewed by the superior court.

The report to the board must contain all significant details of the action taken or the report received from another insurance regulator.

(c) The director shall report to the board if there is reasonable cause to believe, during or after an examination of a member insurer, that the company may be impaired or insolvent.

###### Sec. 21.79.110.   Miscellaneous provisions.

(a) This chapter does not reduce the liability for unpaid assessments of an insured of an impaired or insolvent insurer operating under an insurance policy with assessment liability.

(b) The association shall keep records of meetings relating to its activities. Records of meetings may only be made public under AS 21.79.040(b)

(1) after the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding that involves the impaired or insolvent insurer;

(2) [Repealed,§58 ch 47 SLA 2018.]

(3) upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(c) The association is considered to be a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies that are reduced by an amount to which the association is entitled under AS 21.79.060(k). Assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer that are attributable to covered policies shall be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer as required by this chapter. Assets attributable to covered policies or contracts include those assets that should have been established as reserves for the covered policies or contracts. These assets are determined by multiplying the total assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount that should have been established as reserves for the covered policies or contracts of the impaired or insolvent insurer, and the denominator of which is the amount that should have been established as reserves for all policies or contracts of insurance issued in all states by that insurer. As a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer, the association and other similar entities in other states are entitled to receive a disbursement of assets out of the marshaled assets as a credit against contractual obligations under this chapter from time to time as the assets become available. If the liquidator has not, within 120 days after the date of a final determination of insolvency of a member insurer by the court, made an application to the court for the approval of a proposal to disburse assets, the association may make application to the court for the approval of the association's proposal to disburse assets.

(d) Before the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding, the court may consider the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, shareholders, contract owners, certificate holders, enrollees, and policyholders of the impaired or insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in distributing the ownership rights of the impaired or insolvent insurer. The court shall consider the welfare of policyholders, contract owners, certificate holders, and enrollees of the continuing or successor member insurer. A distribution to stockholders of an impaired or insolvent insurer may not be made until the total amount of valid claims of the association for money spent in carrying out its powers and duties under AS 21.79.060, with respect to the impaired or insolvent insurer, has been fully recovered by the association.

(e) [Repealed,§58 ch 47 SLA 2018.]

(f) A deposit in this state, held by law or required by the director for the benefit of creditors, including policy or contract owners, not turned over to the domiciliary liquidator upon the entry of a final order of liquidation or order approving a rehabilitation plan of a member insurer domiciled in this state or in a reciprocal state shall be promptly paid to the association. The association

(1) is entitled to retain a portion of any amount paid to it equal to the percentage determined by dividing the aggregate amount of policy or contract owners' claims related to that insolvency for which the association has provided statutory benefits by the aggregate amount of all policy or contract owners' claims in this state related to that insolvency; and

(2) shall remit to the domiciliary receiver the amount paid to the association and retained under (1) of this subsection; any amount paid to the association not retained by it under (1) of this subsection shall be treated as a distribution of state assets under AS 21.78.294 or a similar provision of the state of domicile of the impaired or insolvent insurer.

(g) The association may not be required to give an appeal bond in an appeal of a civil action arising under this chapter.

###### Sec. 21.79.120.   Examination of the association, annual report.

The association may be examined by the director. The board shall submit to the director, not later than July 1 of each year, a certified financial report for the preceding calendar year in a form approved by the director and a report of its activities during the preceding calendar year. Nothing in AS 21.79.110(b) limits the duty of the association to report under this section. Upon request, the association shall provide a copy of the report to a member insurer.

###### Sec. 21.79.130.   Tax exemption.

The association is exempt from payment of all fees and taxes levied by the state or its political subdivisions, other than real property taxes.

###### Sec. 21.79.140.   Civil immunity.

The association and its agents and employees, members of the Board of Governors, member insurers, and agents and employees of member insurers, and the director and the director's representatives are not civilly liable, and a cause of action of any nature may not arise, for an action or omission in performing duties under this chapter. The immunity extends to the participation in an organization of one or more other state associations of similar purposes and to that organization and its agents or employees.

###### Sec. 21.79.150.   Stay of proceedings; default judgment.

Proceedings involving an insolvent insurer shall be stayed at least 180 days after the date of a final order of liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation in order to allow the association to exercise a power or duty authorized under this chapter. If a default judgment is entered against an insolvent insurer, the association may apply to have the judgment set aside or may defend against the action on its merits.

###### Sec. 21.79.160.   Prohibited advertisement of insurance sales; required notice.

(a) A person, including a member insurer, agent, or affiliate of a member insurer, may not make, publish, disseminate, circulate, or place before the public, or cause, directly or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated, or placed before the public, in any newspaper, magazine, or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter, or poster, or over any radio station or television station, or in any other way, an advertisement, announcement, or statement, written or oral, that uses the existence of the association for the purpose of sales, solicitation, or inducement to purchase any form of insurance or other coverage covered by the association. However, this section does not apply to the association or any other entity that does not sell or solicit insurance, coverage by a hospital or medical service corporation, or coverage by a health maintenance organization.

(b) The association shall prepare a summary document describing the general purposes and current limitations of this chapter and complying with (c) of this section. This document shall be submitted to the director for approval. Beginning 60 days after the date on which the director approves the document, a member insurer may not deliver a policy or contract to a policy or contract owner, certificate holder, or enrollee unless the summary document is delivered to the policy or contract owner, certificate holder, or enrollee at the time of delivery of the policy or contract. The document shall also be available upon request by a policy or contract owner, certificate holder, or enrollee. The distribution, delivery, contents, or interpretation of this document does not guarantee that either the policy or the contract, or the policy or contract owner, certificate holder, or enrollee is covered in the event of the impairment or insolvency of a member insurer. The description document shall be revised by the association as amendments to this chapter may require. Failure to receive this document does not give the policy or contract owner, certificate holder, enrollee, or insured any greater rights than those stated in this chapter.

(c) The document prepared under (b) of this section must contain a clear and conspicuous disclaimer on its face. The director shall establish the form and content of the disclaimer. The disclaimer must

(1) state the name and address of the association and the division of insurance;

(2) prominently warn the policy or contract owner, certificate holder, or enrollee that the association may not cover the policy or, if coverage is available, that the policy will be subject to substantial limitations and exclusions and conditioned on continued residence in this state;

(3) state the types of policies or contracts for which guaranty funds will provide coverage;

(4) state that the member insurer and its agents are prohibited by law from using the existence of the association for the purpose of sales, solicitation, or inducement to purchase any form of insurance, hospital or medical service corporation coverage, or health maintenance organization coverage;

(5) state that the policy or contract owner, certificate holder, or enrollee should not rely on coverage under the association when selecting an insurer;

(6) explain rights available and procedures for filing a complaint to allege a violation of a provision of this chapter; and

(7) provide other information as required by the director, including sources for information about the financial condition of insurers if the information is not proprietary and is subject by law to disclosure.

(d) A member insurer shall retain evidence of compliance with (b) of this section for so long as the policy or contract for which the notice is given remains in effect.

###### Sec. 21.79.170.   Determination of principal place of business.

The principal place of business of a plan sponsor consisting of

(1) a single employer or an employee organization is that state in which the plan sponsor exercises the direction, control, and coordination of the operations of the entity, as determined by the association in its reasonable judgment by considering the following factors: (A) the state in which the primary executive and administrative headquarters of the entity are located; (B) the state in which the principal office of the chief executive officer of the entity is located; (C) the state in which the board of directors or a similar governing body of the entity conducts the majority of its meetings; (D) the state in which the executive or management committee of the board of directors or a similar governing body of the entity conducts the majority of its meetings; (E) the state from which the management of the overall operations of the entity is directed; and (F) in the case of a benefit plan sponsored by affiliated companies making up a consolidated corporation, the state in which the holding company or controlling affiliate has its principal place of business as determined using the factors described in (A)§(E) of this paragraph; however, if more than 50 percent of the participants in the benefit plan are employed in a single state, that state is considered to be the principal place of business of a plan sponsor that is a single employer or an employee organization;

(2) two or more employers or employee organizations is that state in which the employers or employee organizations have the largest investment in the benefit plan.

###### Sec. 21.79.180.   Determination of residency of certain individuals.

(A) to a policyholder or claimant in an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy from which the claim arises; or

(B) to pay a claim filed with the association after the final date set by the court for the filing of claims against the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer;

(2) is considered the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and to that extent has all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent;

(3) shall allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the three accounts separately, and assess member insurers separately for each account amounts necessary to pay the obligation of the association under (1) of this subsection subsequent to an insolvency, the expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency, and other expenses authorized by this chapter; under this paragraph,

(A) the assessments of each member insurer must initially be based on a uniform percentage, as determined by the association, of the net direct written premiums of each member insurer for the last year for which annual statements have been filed on the kinds of insurance in the account; this initial assessment shall be adjusted by applying the same uniform percentage as initially used to each member insurer's net direct written premiums for the calendar year following the year in which the initial assessment was issued; any difference between the initial assessment amount and the adjusted assessment amount allocated to a member insurer shall be levied against or credited back to the member insurer, as appropriate, by the association; the association shall calculate and issue all appropriate levies and credits as soon as practical after all member insurers have filed their annual statements for the calendar year following the year in which the initial assessment was issued;

(B) on an annual basis, the association shall determine if funding is required for any of the three accounts; based on this determination, the association shall, during November of each year, issue initial assessments as may be necessary to cover the projected reasonable costs of claims and expenses to administer the association for the following year; under this subparagraph,

(i) the association shall use the services of an independent actuary to assist the association to evaluate and make the projection; and

(ii) an initial assessment may be made at any other time if the association determines funding is necessary, except that a member insurer may not be assessed initial assessments on any account in an amount greater than two percent of the member insurer's net direct written premiums for the applicable calendar year;

(C) the association may pay claims in any order that it determines reasonable, including the payment of claims as they are received from claimants or in groups or categories of claims; however, if the maximum of all assessments made under this section, together with the other assets of the association in any account, does not provide, in any one year, in any account, an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from that account, the funds available shall be prorated, and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available;

(D) the association may defer, in whole or in part, an assessment of any member insurer if the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill the insurer's contractual obligations or cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance; however, during the period of deferment, the member insurer may not pay dividends to shareholders or policyholders; a deferred assessment may only be paid when the payment does not reduce capital or surplus below minimums required by law; a member insurer who pays a larger assessment as a result of a deferment given to another member insurer shall receive a refund when the deferment ends or, at the election of the member insurer, receive a credit against future assessments;

(E) each member insurer may set off against an assessment authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of these claims by the member insurer if they are chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made;

(4) shall investigate claims brought against the association, adjust, compromise, settle, and pay covered claims to the extent of the association's obligation, and deny all other claims, and may review settlements, releases, and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties to determine the extent to which settlements, releases, and judgments may be properly contested;

(5) may, subject to AS 21.96.100, appoint, substitute, or direct legal counsel retained under an insurance policy for the defense of a covered claim;

(6) shall handle claims through its employees or through one or more insurers or other persons designated as servicing facilities; a servicing facility shall operate and maintain its principal office in this state unless the use of a servicing facility located outside of the state would result in operating cost savings of at least 10 percent and would not result in material delay in claim payments; designation of a servicing facility is subject to the approval of the director, but designation may be declined by a member insurer;

(7) shall reimburse each servicing facility for obligations of the association paid by the facility and for expenses incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the association and shall pay the other expenses of the association authorized by this chapter.

(b) The association may

(1) employ or retain those persons necessary to handle claims and perform other duties of the association;

(2) borrow funds necessary to effect the purposes of this chapter in accord with the plan of operation and secure guarantees from the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority for association loans that are necessary to make the association financially able to meet cash flow needs;

(4) negotiate and become a party to those contracts that are necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter;

(5) perform all other acts necessary or proper to carry out the purposes of this chapter;

(6) retain amounts excess of claims, expenses, credits, and other liabilities in any account to be applied to reduce future assessments in that account, except that, if, in any year, the association determines that significant funds in excess of projected claims, expenses, credits, and other liabilities exist in an account, the association shall return amounts to policyholders, through procedures established by the association, whereby the association reimburses member insurers for providing uniform credits against rates and premiums charged for all policies applicable to the account issued during the next calendar year.

(2) upon request of the board of governors, provide the association with a statement of the net direct written premiums of each member insurer.

(b) The director may

(1) suspend or revoke, after notice and hearing, the certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state of any member insurer that fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation; as an alternative, the director may levy a fine on any member insurer that fails to pay an assessment when due; this fine may not exceed five percent of the unpaid assessment per month or portion of a month, except that a fine may not be less than $250 a month;

(2) revoke the designation of any servicing facility upon a finding that claims are being handled unsatisfactorily;

(3) upon a finding by the superior court that the board of governors has failed to comply with a requirement of this chapter or the plan of operation, assume the powers of the board of governors under AS 21.80.060.

###### Sec. 21.80.090.   Effect of paid claims.

(a) A person recovering under this chapter is considered to have assigned the person's rights under the policy to the association to the extent of the recovery from the association. Every insured or claimant seeking the protection of this chapter shall cooperate with the association to the same extent as the person would have been required to cooperate with the insolvent insurer. The association does not have a cause of action against the insured of the insolvent insurer for any sums the association has paid out except a cause of action the insolvent insurer would have had if the sums had been paid by the insolvent insurer and except as provided under (b) of this section. In the case of an insolvent insurer operating on a plan with assessment liability, payments of claims of the association do not operate to reduce the liability of insured to the receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor for unpaid assessments.

(b) The association or a similar organization in another state shall be recognized as a claimant in the liquidation of an insolvent insurer for amounts paid by the association or the similar organization on covered claims as determined by this chapter or a similar law of another state and shall receive distributions as provided under AS 21.78.260 or a similar law of another state. The receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor of an insolvent insurer shall be bound by settlements of covered claims by the association or a similar organization in another state to the extent the settlement satisfies obligations of the association. The receiver may not be bound in any way by a settlement of covered claims to the extent there remains a claim that exceeds the claims limit imposed under AS 21.80.060. The court having jurisdiction shall grant these claims priority against the assets of the insolvent insurer equal to the priority that the claimant would have been entitled to in the absence of this chapter. The expenses of the association or similar organization in handling claims shall be accorded the same priority as the liquidator's expenses.

(c) The association shall periodically file with the receiver or liquidator of the insolvent insurer statements of the covered claims paid by the association and estimates of anticipated claims on the association which shall preserve the rights of the association against the assets of the insolvent insurer.

###### Sec. 21.80.095.   Prohibited claims.

An insurer, reinsurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association may not assert a claim against a person insured under a policy issued by an insolvent insurer except for an amount not covered by the claims limit established under AS 21.80.060.

###### Sec. 21.80.100.   Nonduplication of recovery.

(a) A person having a claim against an insurer, whether or not the insurer is a member insurer, under a provision in an insurance policy other than a policy of an insolvent insurer that is also a covered claim is required to exhaust first the person's right under the policy. An amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of recovery under the insurance policy.

(b) A person having a claim which may be recovered under more than one insurance guaranty association or its equivalent shall seek recovery first from the association of the place of residence of the insured except that if it is a first party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, the person shall seek recovery first from the association of the location of the property, and if it is a workers' compensation claim, the person shall seek recovery first from the association of the residence of the claimant.  A recovery under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of recovery from any other insurance guaranty association or its equivalent.

###### Sec. 21.80.110.   Prevention of insolvencies.

The board of governors may

(1) upon a majority vote, make recommendations to the director regarding matters generally related to improving or enhancing regulation for insurer solvency; or

###### Sec. 21.80.120.   Examination of the association.

The association is subject to examination and regulation by the director. The board of governors shall submit, not later than June 30 of each year, a certified financial report for the preceding calendar year in a form approved by the director.

###### Sec. 21.80.130.   Tax exemption.

The association is exempt from payment of all fees and all taxes levied by the state or any of its subdivisions except taxes levied on real or personal property.

###### Sec. 21.80.140.   Recognition of assessments in surcharge rates.

The rates and premiums charged for insurance policies to which this chapter applies may include surcharge rates sufficient to offset the adjusted assessments made under this chapter and paid to the association by member insurers, and these surcharge rates may not be considered excessive because they contain an amount reasonably calculated to offset the full amounted of adjusted assessments paid by member insurers. The association shall notify the director of each surcharge percentage determined by the association, and this surcharge percentage shall be the maximum surcharge rate that may be applied by member insurers related to the assessment, except that a member insurer may make application to the director to apply a higher surcharge rate. The amount charged on a policy shall be shown separate from the premium for coverage on the policy. The surcharge rate is not considered a premium and is not subject to the premium tax imposed under AS 21.09.210.

###### Sec. 21.80.150.   Immunity.

There is no liability on the part of and a cause of action of any nature may not arise against a member insurer, the association or its agents or employees, the board of governors or a person serving as an alternate or substitute representative of a governor, or the director or representatives of the director for action taken or a failure to act by them in the performance of their powers and duties under this chapter. However, immunity from liability under this section does not apply to wilful or wanton misconduct.

###### Sec. 21.80.160.   Stay of proceedings and reopening of default judgments.

All proceedings in which the insolvent insurer is a party or is obligated to defend a party in a court in this state shall, subject to waiver by the board of governors of the association in specific cases involving covered claims, be stayed for 90 days or additional time as ordered by a court from the date the insolvency is determined or an ancillary proceeding is instituted in this state, whichever is later, to permit proper defense by the association for all pending causes of action as to any covered claims arising from a judgment under a decision, verdict, or finding based on the default of the insolvent insurer or its failure to defend an insured. The association, either on its own behalf or on behalf of the insured, may apply to have this judgment, order, decision, verdict, or finding set aside by the same court or administrator that made the judgment, order, decision, verdict, or finding and shall be permitted to defend against the claim on the merits.

The meetings of the supreme governing body of a society may be held in a state, district, province, or territory in which the society has at least one subordinate lodge or in another location as determined by the supreme governing body.

However, a society may not indemnify or reimburse a person in connection with a matter in an action, suit, or proceeding, or threat of an action, suit, or proceeding, that has been made the subject of a compromise settlement, or in which the person is adjudged to be guilty of breach of a duty as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society, unless the person acted in good faith for a purpose the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the society, and, in a criminal action or proceeding, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct constituted a violation of a criminal law of this state or another jurisdiction. The determination of whether the conduct of the person meets the standard required to justify indemnification and reimbursement may be made by the supreme governing body or the board of directors through a majority vote of a quorum consisting of persons who were not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding or by a court of competent jurisdiction. The termination of an action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or plea of no contest as to the person does not in itself create a conclusive presumption that the person did not meet the standard of conduct required to justify indemnification and reimbursement. The right of indemnification and reimbursement is not exclusive of other rights to which a person may be entitled as a matter of law and inures to the benefit of the person's heirs, executors, and administrators.

(c) A society may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society, or who is or was serving at the request of the society as a director, officer, employee, or agent of a firm, corporation, or organization, against a liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person arising out of that capacity, whether or not the society would have the power to indemnify the person against that liability under this section.

(d) A director, officer, employee, member, or volunteer of a society serving without compensation is not liable, and no cause of action may be brought against the person for damages resulting from the exercise of judgment or discretion in connection with the duties or responsibilities of the person for the society unless the act or omission involved reckless or intentional misconduct.

Unless the director disapproves the amendment within 60 days after it is filed, the amendment is considered approved. The approval or disapproval of the director shall be in writing and mailed to the secretary or corresponding officer of the society at its principal office. If the director disapproves the amendment, the reason for the disapproval shall be stated in the written notice.

(c) Within 90 days from the approval of the amendments by the director, all amendments, or a synopsis of them, shall be furnished to all members of the society, either by mail or by publication in full in the official publication of the society.

###### Sec. 21.84.255.   The benefit contract.

The certificate, together with any riders or endorsements attached to it, the laws of the society, the application for membership, the application for insurance, and the declaration of insurability, if any, signed by the applicant, and all amendments to each constitute the benefit contract, as of the date of issuance, between the society and the owner, and the certificate must so state.

All statements on the application shall be representations and not warranties. A waiver of this provision is void.

(b) Except as provided in AS 21.84.320(d)(3), changes, additions, or amendments to the laws of the society enacted subsequent to the issuance of the certificate shall bind the owner and the beneficiaries and shall govern and control the benefit contract in all respects as though the changes, additions, or amendments were made before and were in force at the time of the application for insurance, except that a change, addition, or amendment may not destroy or diminish benefits that the society contracted to give the owner as of the date of issuance.

The society may specify the manner of the election and the alternative that is to be presumed if no election is made.

(e) Copies of the documents mentioned in this section, certified by the secretary or corresponding officer of the society, shall be received in evidence of the terms and conditions of the document.

A filing is considered approved unless disapproved within 60 days after the date of filing. A life, accident, health, or disability insurance certificate and an annuity certificate issued on or after one year after January 1, 1998, must meet the standard contract provision requirements not inconsistent with this chapter for similar policies issued by life and health insurers in this state, except that a society may provide in a certificate for a grace period for payment of premiums of one full month. The certificate must also contain a provision stating the amount of premiums that are payable under the certificate and a provision reciting or setting out the substance of sections of the society's laws or rules in force at the time of issuance of the certificate that, if violated, will result in the termination or reduction of benefits payable under the certificate. If the laws of the society provide for expulsion or suspension of a member, the certificate must also contain a provision that any member expelled or suspended, except for nonpayment of a premium or within the contestable period for material misrepresentation in the application for membership or insurance, is entitled to maintain the certificate in force by continuing payment of the required premium.

A society may require approval of an application for membership in order to effect this transfer and may provide in all other respects for the regulation, government, and control of those certificates and all rights, obligations, and liabilities incident to and connected with those certificates. Ownership rights before transfer shall be specified in the certificate.

A filing shall be made not less than 30 days before the intended date of delivery or issuance.  The form of evidence of coverage, amendment, or endorsement is considered approved 30 days after it was filed, unless it is affirmatively approved or disapproved by an order of the director before the expiration of the 30-day period.  If the form of evidence of coverage, amendment, or endorsement is disapproved, the director's order must specify the reasons for disapproval.

The charges may not be excessive, inadequate, nor unfairly discriminatory.  Certification by an actuary who is a member in good standing of the American Academy of Actuaries or another person who is considered qualified by the director, as to the appropriateness of the application of the charges, based on reasonable assumptions, must accompany each filing under (e) of this section, along with adequate supporting information.

Within 10 days after an enrollee's first visit, a chiropractor shall transmit a report containing the enrollee's primary complaint, related history, examination findings, initial diagnosis, and treatment plan to the enrollee's health maintenance organization. If the enrollee and the enrollee's chiropractor determine that the condition of the enrollee has not improved within 30 days after the initial treatment, the chiropractor shall refer the enrollee back to the enrollee's health maintenance organization for examination and possible concurrent care.

(b) If the enrollee's chiropractor recommends chiropractic treatment beyond 30 days, the chiropractor shall conduct a second examination and transmit the findings to the enrollee's health maintenance organization.

If the treating chiropractor and the reviewing chiropractor disagree on the enrollee's continued treatment, the enrollee and the health maintenance organization shall jointly select a third chiropractor to review the enrollee's chiropractic treatment. Selection of a third chiropractor must occur not more than 60 days after the date of the enrollee's initial treatment by the enrollee's treating chiropractor. Until the third chiropractor's opinion is received in writing by the enrollee and the health maintenance organization, the enrollee may receive chiropractic treatment recommended by the treating chiropractor. The opinion of the third chiropractor as to continued chiropractic treatment is binding on the enrollee and the health maintenance organization. This subsection does not apply if a new documented injury or a substantial exacerbation of the enrollee's previous primary complaint occurs.

###### Sec. 21.86.078.   Choice of health care provider.

(a) A health maintenance organization shall offer to every enrollee a point-of-service plan option that would allow a covered person to receive covered services from an out-of-network health care provider without obtaining a referral or prior authorization from the health maintenance organization. The point-of-service plan option may require that an enrollee pay a higher deductible or copayment and higher premium for the plan.

(b) A health maintenance organization shall provide each enrollee with an opportunity at the time of enrollment and during the annual open enrollment period to enroll in the point-of-service plan option. The health maintenance organization shall provide written notice of the point-of-service plan option to each enrollee and shall include in that notice a detailed explanation of the financial costs to be incurred by an enrollee who selects that option.

###### Sec. 21.86.110.   Recovery of health care costs.

If a health maintenance organization determines that an enrollee has received health care services that the enrollee is not entitled to receive under the terms of the health maintenance agreement, the organization may not recover an amount above the actual cost of providing the health care service. This section does not apply if the enrollee gave or withheld information to the health maintenance organization with the intent to mislead or misinform the organization as to the enrollee's right to receive the health care services.

###### Sec. 21.86.120.   Return of agreement.

A person who enters into a health maintenance agreement may return the agreement to the health maintenance organization or the agent from whom it was purchased within 10 days of the delivery of the agreement to the person if the person is not satisfied for any reason.

(B) has, for each organization sponsored, a net worth at least equal to the capital and surplus requirement for a health insurer.

(f) All deposit income belongs to the depositing health maintenance organization, and shall be paid to it as it becomes available. A health maintenance organization that has made a deposit of securities may withdraw that deposit, or any part of it, after making a substitute deposit of cash, securities, or a combination of these or other means of equal amount and value. Substitution of securities must have prior approval by the director.

(g) In a year in which an annual deposit is not required of a health maintenance organization under this section, at the organization's request the director shall reduce the required, previously accumulated deposit by $100,000 for each $250,000 of net worth in excess of the amount that allows the organization not to make the annual deposit.  If the amount of an organization's net worth is reduced to less than the amount that allowed a reduction in accumulated deposit, the organization shall immediately redeposit $100,000 for each $250,000 of reduction in net worth, except that the total deposit need not exceed the maximum required under this section.

(2) a statement or item of information is considered to be misleading, whether or not it is untrue, if, in the total context in which the statement is made or the item of information is communicated, the statement or item of information might be understood by a reasonable person, not possessing special knowledge regarding health care coverage, as indicating a benefit or advantage or the absence of an exclusion, limitation, or disadvantage of possible significance to an enrollee of, or person considering enrollment in, a health maintenance organization if the benefit or advantage or absence of limitation, exclusion, or disadvantage does not exist;

(3) an evidence of coverage is considered to be deceptive if the evidence of coverage taken as a whole, and with consideration given to typography and format, as well as to language, might cause a reasonable person, not possessing special knowledge regarding health maintenance organizations or an evidence of coverage, to expect benefits, services, charges, or other advantages that the evidence of coverage does not provide or that the health maintenance organization issuing the evidence of coverage does not regularly make available for an enrollee covered under the evidence of coverage.

(c) AS 21.36 applies to health maintenance organizations and to an evidence of coverage except to the extent that the director determines that the nature of health maintenance organizations and the evidence of coverage renders that chapter clearly inappropriate.

(d) A health maintenance organization may not cancel or refuse to review an enrollee, except for

(1) reasons stated in the organization's regulations applicable to all enrollees;

(2) failure to pay the charge for the enrollee's coverage; or

(1) is applied uniformly without regard to a health status factor;

(2) does not exceed two months for new enrollees and three months for late enrollees;

(3) begins on the enrollment date; and

(4) runs concurrently with any waiting period under the plan.

(h) A health maintenance organization may use a method other than a preexisting condition exclusion or an affiliation period to lessen the risk of adverse selection only with prior written approval of the director.

(i) A health maintenance organization, including a health maintenance organization operating a managed care plan, or a representative of a health maintenance organization may not cause, request, or knowingly permit

(1) the imposition of limits regarding

(A) criticism by a health care provider of health care services provided by the health maintenance organization; or

(B) written or oral communications between a health care provider and an enrollee regarding health care services;

(2) the employment of a health care provider to be terminated unless the provider receives written notice of the cause for the termination before being terminated;

###### Sec. 21.86.160.   Regulation of agents.

(a) The director may adopt regulations necessary to provide for the licensing of health maintenance organization agents.

(b) The director may, by regulation, exempt certain classes of persons from the requirement of obtaining an agent license if

(a) An insurer licensed in this state, or a hospital or medical service corporation authorized to do business in this state, may, either directly or through a subsidiary or affiliate, organize and operate a health maintenance organization under the provisions of this chapter.  Two or more insurance companies, hospitals or medical service corporations, or subsidiaries or affiliates of them, may jointly organize and operate a health maintenance organization.  The business of insurance is considered to include providing health care by a health maintenance organization owned or operated by an insurer or subsidiary of an insurer.

(b) An insurer or hospital or medical service corporation may contract with a health maintenance organization to provide insurance or similar protection against the cost of care provided through a health maintenance organization and to provide coverage in the event of the failure of the health maintenance organization to meet its obligations.

The review required under this subsection shall be done by a review organization approved by the Department of Health and shall be done under regulations adopted by that department. The health maintenance organization shall pay the cost of the review.

(2) the health maintenance organization issues an evidence of coverage, or uses a schedule of charges for health care services, that does not comply with the requirements of AS 21.86.070;

(3) the health maintenance organization does not provide or arrange for the provision of basic health care services;

(4) the health maintenance organization is not in compliance with state and federal statutes and regulations as required under AS 21.86.010(b)(12), or is unable to fulfill its obligations to furnish health care services;

(5) the health maintenance organization is no longer financially responsible and may reasonably be expected to be unable to meet its obligations to enrollees or prospective enrollees;

(6) the health maintenance organization has failed to implement a mechanism affording the enrollees an opportunity to participate in matters of policy and operation under AS 21.86.040;

(7) the health maintenance organization has failed to implement the complaint system required by AS 21.86.100 in a reasonable manner to resolve valid complaints;

(9) the continued operation of the health maintenance organization would be hazardous to its enrollees;

(10) the health maintenance organization has otherwise failed substantially to comply with this chapter.

(b) If the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is suspended, the health maintenance organization may not, during the period of the suspension, enroll additional enrollees except newborn children or other newly acquired dependents of existing enrollees, and may not engage in advertising or solicitation.  The director may, by written order, specify limitations in the operation of the organization during the period of suspension as the director finds to be in the best interests of enrollees.

(c) If the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is revoked, the organization shall, immediately following the effective date of the order of revocation, proceed to wind up its affairs, and may not conduct further business except that essential to the orderly conclusion of the affairs of the organization.

The director may, by written order, permit continued operation of the organization as the director finds to be in the best interest of enrollees, so that enrollees will be afforded the greatest practical opportunity to obtain continuing health care coverage.

###### Sec. 21.86.200.   Administrative procedures.

(a) If the director has reason to believe that grounds for the denial, suspension, or revocation of a certificate of authority exist, the director shall notify the applicant or the health maintenance organization in writing, specifically stating the grounds for denial, suspension, or revocation. A person aggrieved by a decision of the director regarding denial, suspension, or revocation of a certificate of authority may request a hearing under AS 21.06.180. If a hearing is requested, it shall be held under the procedures in AS 21.06.170§21.06.220, except that AS 21.06.190 does not apply in the case of a hearing regarding denial of a certificate.

###### Sec. 21.86.210.   Rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation.

(a) A rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation of a health maintenance organization is considered to be a rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation of an insurer, and shall be conducted under AS 21.78.

(b) Enrollees of a health maintenance organization have the same priority in the event of liquidation or rehabilitation as AS 21.78 provides to policyholders of an insurer.  A claim made by a health care provider in a liquidation or rehabilitation that pertains to services provided to an enrollee, has the same priority as an enrollee if the provider agrees not to assert the claim against an enrollee and if any payment fully discharges the obligation of the enrollee.

###### Sec. 21.86.220.   Regulations.

(b) The director may issue an order directing a health maintenance organization or a person representing a health maintenance organization to stop engaging in an act or practice that is in violation of this chapter or a regulation adopted under this chapter. Within five days after service of a stop order under this subsection, the respondent may request, in writing, a hearing on the question of whether the act or practice has occurred in violation of this chapter or a regulation adopted by the director.  The hearing shall commence within 10 days after the written request for the hearing has been received by the director unless the respondent requests that the hearing take place at a later date and the director agrees to the later hearing date.

###### Sec. 21.86.260.   Statutory construction and relationship to other law.

(a) Except as provided in AS 21.36, AS 21.42, AS 21.54, AS 21.56, AS 21.79, and in this chapter, this title does not apply to a health maintenance organization that obtains a certificate of authority under this chapter. This subsection does not apply to an insurer licensed under AS 21.09 or a hospital or medical service corporation licensed under AS 21.87 except with respect to its health maintenance organization activities authorized by and regulated under this chapter.

If the appraisers fail to agree, the appraisers will promptly submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by one of the appraisers and the umpire will be binding upon the insured and insurer. All expenses and fees, not including counsel or adjuster fees, incurred because of the appraisal shall be paid as determined by the umpire.

###### Sec. 21.96.100.   Appointment of independent counsel; conflicts of interest; settlement.

(a) If an insurer has a duty to defend an insured under a policy of insurance and a conflict of interest arises that imposes a duty on the insurer to provide independent counsel to the insured, the insurer shall provide independent counsel to the insured unless the insured in writing waives the right to independent counsel. An insurance policy may contain a provision that provides a method of selecting independent counsel if the provision complies with this section.

(b) For purposes of this section, the following do not constitute a conflict of interest:

(1) a claim of punitive damages;

(2) a claim of damages in excess of the policy limits;

(3) claims or facts in a civil action for which the insurer denies coverage.

(c) Notwithstanding (b) of this section, if the insurer reserves the insurer's rights on an issue for which coverage is denied, the insurer shall provide independent counsel to the insured as provided under (a) of this section.

(d) If the insured selects independent counsel at the insurer's expense, the insurer may require that the independent counsel have at least four years of experience in civil litigation, including defense experience in the general subject area at issue in the civil action, and malpractice insurance. Unless otherwise provided in the insurance policy, the obligation of the insurer to pay the fee charged by the independent counsel is limited to the rate that is actually paid by the insurer to an attorney in the ordinary course of business in the defense of a similar civil action in the community in which the claim arose or is being defended. In providing independent counsel, the insurer is not responsible for the fees and costs of defending an allegation for which coverage is properly denied and shall be responsible only for the fees and costs to defend those allegations for which the insurer either reserves its position as to coverage or accepts coverage. The independent counsel shall keep detailed records allocating fees and costs accordingly. A dispute between the insurer and insured regarding attorney fees that is not resolved by the insurance policy or this section shall be resolved by arbitration under AS 09.43.

(e) If the insured selects independent counsel at the insurer's expense, the independent counsel and the insured shall consult with the insurer on all matters relating to the civil action and shall disclose to the insurer in a timely manner all information relevant to the civil action, except information that is privileged and relevant to disputed coverage. A claim of privilege is subject to review in the appropriate court. Information disclosed by the independent counsel or the insured does not waive another party's right to assert privilege.

(f) An insured may waive the right to select independent counsel by signing a statement that reads substantially as follows:

I have been advised of my right to select independent counsel to represent me in this lawsuit and of my right under state law to have all reasonable expenses of an independent counsel paid by my insurer. I have also been advised that the Alaska Supreme Court has ruled that when an insurer defends an insured under a reservation of rights provision in an insurance policy, there are various conflicts of interest that arise between an insurer and an insured. I have considered this matter fully and at this time I am waiving my right to select independent counsel. I have authorized my insurer to select a defense counsel to represent me in this lawsuit.
