If a taxpayer fails to file a return or report required by this title in the time required by law or regulation, or makes an erroneous or fraudulent return, the department shall proceed to assess the license fees, tax, penalties, or interest and make a return from information that it obtains. An assessment or a return subscribed by the department in accordance with this section is presumed sufficient for all legal purposes. However, nothing prevents a taxpayer from presenting evidence or other information in an informal conference under AS 43.05.240 or in an appeal under AS 43.05.241 in order to rebut the presumed sufficiency of an assessment or return subscribed by the department, nor does the presumption of sufficiency alter the parties' respective burdens of proof once the taxpayer has presented evidence or other material information to rebut that presumption. The assessment of license fees, tax, penalties, or interest under this section occurs when the department issues a notice and demand for payment of the license fees, tax, penalties, or interest. The notice and demand for payment is issued when the notice and demand is delivered to the taxpayer in person or placed in the United States mail, addressed to the last known address of the taxpayer. Penalties and interest assessed under this title shall be collected in the same manner as provided in this title for the collection of tax or license fees.

If the tax is not assessed before the expiration of the applicable period, proceedings may not be instituted in court for the collection of the tax.

(c) The following exceptions apply to the limitation period in (a) of this section:

## Chapter 19. Multistate Tax Compact.

###### Sec. 43.19.010.   Compact.

The Multistate Tax Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining in it, in the form substantially as follows:

The purposes of this compact are to:

1. Facilitate proper determination of state and local tax liability of multistate taxpayers, including the equitable apportionment of tax bases and settlement of apportionment disputes.

2. Promote uniformity or compatibility in significant components of tax systems.

3. Facilitate taxpayer convenience and compliance in the filing of tax returns and in other phases of tax administration.

4. Avoid duplicative taxation.

As used in this compact:

1. "State" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States.

2. "Subdivision" means any governmental unit or special district of a state.

3. "Taxpayer" means any corporation, partnership, firm, association, governmental unit or agency or person acting as a business entity in more than one state.

4. "Income tax" means a tax imposed on or measured by net income including any tax imposed on or measured by an amount arrived at by deducting expenses from gross income, one or more forms of which expenses are not specifically and directly related to particular transactions.

5. "Capital stock tax" means a tax measured in any way by the capital of a corporation considered in its entirety.

6. "Gross receipts tax" means a tax, other than a sales tax, which is imposed on or measured by the gross volume of business, in terms of gross receipts or in other terms, and in the determination of which no deduction is allowed which would constitute the tax an income tax.

7. "Sales tax" means a tax imposed with respect to the transfer for a consideration of ownership, possession or custody of tangible personal property or the rendering of services measured by the price of the tangible personal property transferred or services rendered and which is required by state or local law to be separately stated from the sales price by the seller, or which is customarily separately stated from the sales price, but does not include a tax imposed exclusively on the sale of a specifically identified commodity or article or class of commodities or articles.

8. "Use tax" means a nonrecurring tax, other than a sales tax, which (a) is imposed on or with respect to the exercise or enjoyment of any right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership, possession or custody of that property or the leasing of that property from another including any consumption, keeping, retention, or other use of tangible personal property and (b) is complementary to a sales tax.

9. "Tax" means an income tax, capital stock tax, gross receipts tax, sales tax, use tax, and any other tax which has a multistate impact, except that the provisions of Articles III, IV and V of this compact shall apply only to the taxes specifically designated therein and the provisions of Article IX of this compact shall apply only in respect to determinations pursuant to Article IV.

Taxpayers Option, State and Local Taxes.1. Any taxpayer subject to an income tax whose income is subject to apportionment and allocation for tax purposes pursuant to the laws of a party state or pursuant to the laws of subdivisions in two or more party states may elect to apportion and allocate the taxpayer's income in the manner provided by the laws of such state or by the laws of such states and subdivisions without reference to this compact, or may elect to apportion and allocate in accordance with Article IV.  This election for any tax year may be made in all party states or subdivisions thereof or in any one or more of the party states or subdivisions thereof without reference to the election made in the others.  For the purposes of this paragraph, taxes imposed by subdivisions shall be considered separately from state taxes and the apportionment and allocation also may be applied to the entire tax base.  In no instance wherein Article IV is employed for all subdivisions of a state may the sum of all apportionments and allocations to subdivisions within a state be greater than the apportionment and allocation that would be assignable to that state if the apportionment or allocation were being made with respect to a state income tax.

Taxpayer Option, Short Form.2. Each party state or any subdivision thereof which imposes an income tax shall provide by law that any taxpayer required to file a return, whose only activities within the taxing jurisdiction consist of sales and do not include owning or renting real estate or tangible personal property, and whose dollar volume of gross sales made during the tax year within the state or subdivision, as the case may be, is not in excess of $100,000 may elect to report and pay any tax due on the basis of a percentage of such volume, and shall adopt rates which shall produce a tax which reasonably approximates the tax otherwise due.  The Multistate Tax Commission, not more than once in five years, may adjust the $100,000 figure in order to reflect such changes as may occur in the real value of the dollar, and such adjusted figure, upon adoption by the commission, shall replace the $100,000 figure specifically provided herein.  Each party state and subdivision thereof may make the same election available to taxpayers additional to those specified in this paragraph.

Coverage.3. Nothing in this Article relates to the reporting or payment of any tax other than an income tax.

1. As used in this Article, unless the context otherwise requires:

(a) "Business income" means income arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business and includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer's regular trade or business operations.

(b) "Commercial domicile" means the principal place from which the trade or business of the taxpayer is directed or managed.

(c) "Compensation" means wages, salaries, commissions and any other form of remuneration paid to employees for personal services.

(d) "Financial organization" means any bank, trust company, savings bank, industrial bank, land bank, safe deposit company, private banker, savings and loan association, credit union, cooperative bank, small loan company, sales finance company, investment company, or any type of insurance company.

(e) "Nonbusiness income" means all income other than business income.

(f) "Public utility" means any business entity (1) which owns or operates any plant, equipment, property, franchise, or license for the transmission of communications, transportation of goods or persons, except by pipe line, or the production, transmission, sale, delivery, or furnishing of electricity, water or steam; and (2) whose rates of charges for goods or services have been established or approved by a federal, state or local government or governmental agency.

(g) "Sales" means all gross receipts of the taxpayer not allocated under paragraphs of this Article.

(h) "State" means any state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, and any foreign country or political subdivision thereof.

(i) "This state" means the state in which the relevant tax return is filed or, in the case of application of this Article to the apportionment and allocation of income for local tax purposes, the subdivision or local taxing district in which the relevant tax return is filed.

2. Any taxpayer having income from business activity which is taxable both within and outside this state, other than activity as a financial organization or public utility or the rendering of purely personal services by an individual, shall allocate and apportion net income as provided in this Article. If a taxpayer has income from business activity as a public utility but derives the greater percentage of income from activities subject to this Article, the taxpayer may elect to allocate and apportion the taxpayer's entire net income as provided in this Article.

3. For purposes of allocation and apportionment of income under this Article, a taxpayer is taxable in another state if (1) in that state the taxpayer is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, or a corporate stock tax, or (2) that state has jurisdiction to subject the taxpayer to a net income tax regardless of whether, in fact, the state does or does not.

4. Rents and royalties from real or tangible personal property, capital gains, interest, dividends or patent or copyright royalties, to the extent that they constitute nonbusiness income, shall be allocated as provided in paragraphs 5 through 8 of this Article.

5.(a) Net rents and royalties from real property located in this state are allocable to this state.

(b) Net rents and royalties from tangible personal property are allocable to this state: (1) if and to the extent that the property is utilized in this state, or (2) in their entirety if the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state and the taxpayer is not organized under the laws of or taxable in the state in which the property is utilized.

(c) The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in a state is determined by multiplying the rents and royalties by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property in the state during the rental or royalty period in the taxable year and the denominator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property everywhere during all rental or royalty periods in the taxable year.  If the physical location of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown or unascertainable by the taxpayer, tangible personal property is utilized in the state in which the property was located at the time the rental or royalty payer obtained possession.

6.(a) Capital gains and losses from sales of real property located in this state are allocable to this state.

(b) Capital gains and losses from sales of tangible personal property are allocable to this state if (1) the property had a situs in this state at the time of the sale, or (2) the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state and the taxpayer is not taxable in the state in which the property had a situs.

(c) Capital gains and losses from sales of intangible personal property are allocable to this state if the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state.

7. Interest and dividends are allocable to this state if the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state.

8.(a) Patent and copyright royalties are allocable to this state: (1) if and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the payer in this state, or (2) if and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the payer in a state in which the taxpayer is not taxable and the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state.

(b) A patent is utilized in a state to the extent that it is employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other processing in the state or to the extent that a patented product is produced in the state.  If the basis of receipts from patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the patent is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer's commercial domicile is located.

(c) A copyright is utilized in a state to the extent that printing or other publication originates in the state.  If the basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the copyright is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer's commercial domicile is located.

9. All business income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus the sales factor, and the denominator of which is three.

10. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this state during the tax period and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the tax period.

11. Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost.  Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental rate.  Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from subrentals.

12. The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the tax period but the tax administrator may require the averaging of monthly values during the tax period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayer's property.

13. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in this state during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period.

14. Compensation is paid in this state if:

(a) the individual's service is performed entirely within the state;

(b) the individual's service is performed both inside and outside the state, but the service performed outside the state is incidental to the individual's service within this state; or

(c) some of the service is performed in the state and (1) the base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in the state, or (2) the base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual's residence is in this state.

15. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period.

16. Sales of tangible personal property are in this state if:

(a) the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than the United States Government, within this state regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or

(b) the property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory, or other place of storage in this state and (1) the purchaser is the United States Government or (2) the taxpayer is not taxable in the state of the purchaser.

17. Sales, other than sales of tangible personal property, are in this state if:

(a) the income-producing activity is performed in this state; or

(b) the income-producing activity is performed both in and outside this state and a greater proportion of the income-producing activity is performed in this state than in any other state, based on costs of performance.

18. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this Article do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrator may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, if reasonable:

(a) separate accounting;

(b) the exclusion of any one or more of the factors;

(c) the inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly represent the taxpayer's business activity in this state; or

(d) the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income.

Tax Credit.1. Each purchaser liable for a use tax on tangible personal property shall be entitled to full credit for the combined amount or amounts of legally imposed sales or use taxes paid by the purchaser with respect to the same property to another state and any subdivision thereof.  The credit shall be applied first against the amount of any use tax due the state, and any unused portion of the credit shall then be applied against the amount of any use tax due a subdivision.

Exemption Certificates, Vendors May Rely.2. Whenever a vendor receives and accepts in good faith from a purchaser a resale or other exemption certificate or other written evidence of exemption authorized by the appropriate state or subdivision taxing authority, the vendor shall be relieved of liability for a sales or use tax with respect to the transaction.

Organization and Management.1.(a) The Multistate Tax Commission is hereby established. It shall be composed of one "member" from each party state who shall be the head of the state agency charged with the administration of the types of taxes to which this compact applies.  If there is more than one such agency the state shall provide by law for the selection of the commission member from the heads of the relevant agencies.  State law may provide that a member of the commission be represented by an alternate but only if there is on file with the commission written notification of the designation and identity of the alternate.  The attorney general of each party state or the designee of the attorney general, or other counsel if the laws of the party state specifically provide, shall be entitled to attend the meetings of the commission, but shall not vote. Such attorneys general, designees, or other counsel shall receive all notices of meetings required under paragraph 1(e) of this Article.

(b) Each party state shall provide by law for the selection of representatives from its subdivisions affected by this compact to consult with the commission member from that state.

(d) The commission shall adopt an official seal to be used as it may provide.

(e) The commission shall hold an annual meeting and such other regular meetings as its bylaws may provide and such special meetings as its executive committee may determine. The commission bylaws shall specify the dates of the annual and any other regular meetings, and shall provide for the giving of notice of annual, regular and special meetings. Notices of special meetings shall include the reasons therefor and an agenda of the items to be considered.

(f) The commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice-chairman and a treasurer.  The commission shall appoint an executive director who shall serve at its pleasure, and it shall fix the duties and compensation of the executive director.  The executive director shall be secretary of the commission. The commission shall make provision for the bonding of such of its officers and employees as it may deem appropriate.

(g) Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any party state, the executive director shall appoint or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the commission and shall fix their duties and compensation.  The commission bylaws shall provide for personnel policies and programs.

(h) The commission may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any state, the United States, or any other governmental entity.

Any donation or grant accepted by the commission or services borrowed shall be reported in the annual report of the commission, and shall include the nature, amount and conditions, if any, of the donation, gift, grant or services borrowed and the identity of the donor or lender.  The commission may make additional reports as it may deem desirable.

Committees.2.(a) To assist in the conduct of its business when the full commission is not meeting, the commission shall have an executive committee of seven members, including the chairman, vice-chairman, treasurer and four other members elected annually by the commission.  The executive committee, subject to the provisions of this compact and consistent with the policies of the commission, shall function as provided in the bylaws of the commission.

(b) The commission may establish advisory and technical committees, membership on which may include private persons and public officials, in furthering any of its activities. Such committees may consider any matter of concern to the commission, including problems of special interest to any party state and problems dealing with particular types of taxes.

(c) The commission may establish such additional committees as its bylaws may provide.

Powers.3. In addition to powers conferred elsewhere in this compact, the commission shall have power to:

(a) Study state and local tax systems and particular types of state and local taxes.

(b) Develop and recommend proposals for an increase in uniformity or compatibility of state and local tax laws with a view toward encouraging the simplification and improvement of state and local tax law and administration.

(c) Compile and publish information as in its judgment would assist the party states in implementation of the compact and taxpayers in complying with state and local tax laws.

(d) Do all things necessary and incidental to the administration of its functions pursuant to this compact.

Finance.4.(a) The commission shall submit to the governor or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that state for presentation to the legislature thereof.

(b) Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. The total amount of appropriations requested under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one-tenth in equal shares; and the remainder in proportion to the amount of revenue collected by each party state and its subdivisions from income taxes, capital stock taxes, gross receipts, taxes, sales and use taxes.  In determining such amounts, the commission shall employ such available public sources of information as, in its judgment, present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall indicate the sources used in obtaining information employed in applying the formula contained in this paragraph.

(c) The commission shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under paragraph 1(i) of this Article: provided that the commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the commission makes use of funds available to it under paragraph 1(i), the commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.

(d) The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the commission.

(e) The accounts of the commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the commission.

(f) Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to prevent commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the commission.

1. Whenever any two or more party states, or subdivisions of party states, have uniform or similar provisions of law relating to an income tax, capital stock tax, gross receipts tax, sales or use tax, the commission may adopt uniform regulations for any phase of the administration of such law, including assertion of jurisdiction to tax, or prescribing uniform tax forms. The commission may also act with respect to the provisions of Article IV of this compact.

2. Prior to the adoption of any regulation, the commission shall:

(a) As provided in its bylaws, hold at least one public hearing on due notice to all affected party states and subdivisions thereof and to all taxpayers and other persons who have made timely request of the commission for advance notice of its regulation-making proceedings.

(b) Afford all affected party states and subdivisions and interested persons an opportunity to submit relevant written data and views, which shall be considered fully by the commission.

3. The commission shall submit any regulations adopted by it to the appropriate officials of all party states and subdivisions to which they might apply. Each such state and subdivision shall consider any such regulations for adoption in accordance with its own laws and procedures.

1. This Article shall be in force only in those party states that specifically provide therefor by statute.

2. Any party state or subdivision thereof desiring to make or participate in an audit of any accounts, books, papers, records or other documents may request the commission to perform the audit on its behalf.  In responding to the request, the commission shall have access to and may examine, at any reasonable time, such accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents and any relevant property or stock of merchandise. The commission may enter into agreements with party states or their subdivisions for assistance in performance of the audit. The commission shall make charges, to be paid by the state or local government or governments for which it performs the service, for any audits performed by it in order to reimburse itself for the actual costs incurred in making the audit.

3. The commission may require the attendance of any person within the state where it is conducting an audit or part thereof at a time and place fixed by it within such state for the purpose of giving testimony with respect to any account, book, paper, document, other record, property or stock of merchandise being examined in connection with the audit.  If the person is not within the jurisdiction, the person may be required to attend for such purpose at any time and place fixed by the commission within the state of which the person is a resident: provided that such state has adopted this Article.

4. The commission may apply to any court having power to issue compulsory process for orders in aid of its powers and responsibilities pursuant to this Article and any and all such courts shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. Failure of any person to obey any such order shall be punishable as contempt of the issuing court. If the party or subject matter on account of which the commission seeks an order is within the jurisdiction of the court to which application is made, such application may be to a court in the state or subdivision on behalf of which the audit is being made or a court in the state in which the object of the order being sought is situated. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to courts in a state that has adopted this Article.

5. The commission may decline to perform any audit requested if it finds that its available personnel or other resources are insufficient for the purpose or that, in the terms requested, the audit is impracticable of satisfactory performance. If the commission, on the basis of its experience, has reason to believe that an audit of a particular taxpayer, either at a particular time or on a particular schedule, would be of interest to a number of party states or their subdivisions, it may offer to make the audit or audits, the offer to be contingent on sufficient participation therein as determined by the commission.

6. Information obtained by any audit pursuant to this Article shall be confidential and available only for tax purposes to party states, their subdivisions or the United States. Availability of information shall be in accordance with the laws of the states or subdivisions on whose account the commission performs the audit, and only through the appropriate agencies or officers of such states or subdivisions. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require any taxpayer to keep records for any period not otherwise required by law.

7. Other arrangements made or authorized pursuant to laws for cooperative audit by or on behalf of the party states or any of their subdivisions are not superseded or invalidated by this Article.

8. In no event shall the commission make any charge against a taxpayer for an audit.

9. As used in this Article, "tax," in addition to the meaning ascribed to it in Article II, means any tax or license fee imposed in whole or in part for revenue purposes.

1. Whenever the commission finds a need for settling disputes concerning apportionments and allocations by arbitration, it may adopt a regulation placing this Article in effect, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VII.

2. The commission shall select and maintain an arbitration panel composed of officers and employees of state and local governments and private persons who shall be knowledgeable and experienced in matters of tax law and administration.

3. Whenever a taxpayer who has elected to employ Article IV, or whenever the laws of the party state or subdivision thereof are substantially identical with the relevant provisions of Article IV, the taxpayer, by written notice to the commission and to each party state or subdivision thereof that would be affected, may secure arbitration of an apportionment or allocation, if the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the final administrative determination of the tax agency of the state or subdivision with respect thereto on the ground that it would subject the taxpayer to double or multiple taxation by two or more party states or subdivisions thereof. Each party state and subdivision thereof hereby consents to the arbitration as provided herein, and agrees to be bound thereby.

4. The arbitration board shall be composed of one person selected by the taxpayer, one by the agency or agencies involved, and one member of the commission's arbitration panel. If the agencies involved are unable to agree on the person to be selected by them, such person shall be selected by lot from the total membership of the arbitration panel. The two persons selected for the board in the manner provided by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall jointly select the third member of the board. If they are unable to agree on the selection, the third member shall be selected by lot from among the total membership of the arbitration panel. No member of a board selected by lot shall be qualified to serve if the member is an officer or employee or is otherwise affiliated with any party to the arbitration proceeding. Residence within the jurisdiction of a party to the arbitration proceeding shall not constitute affiliation within the meaning of this paragraph.

5. The board may sit in any state or subdivision party to the proceeding, in the state of the taxpayer's incorporation, residence or domicile, in any state where the taxpayer does business, or in any place that it finds most appropriate for gaining access to evidence relevant to the matter before it.

6. The board shall give due notice of the times and places of its hearings. The parties shall be entitled to be heard, to present evidence, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. The board shall act by majority vote.

7. The board shall have power to administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents, and issue commissions to take testimony. Subpoenas may be signed by any member of the board. In case of failure to obey a subpoena, and upon application by the board, any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction of the state in which the board is sitting or in which the person to whom the subpoena is directed may be found may make an order requiring compliance with the subpoena, and the court may punish failure to obey the order as a contempt. The provisions of this paragraph apply only in states that have adopted this Article.

(d) When distraint is made, as provided in this section,

(1) the deputy or agent charged with the collection shall make or have made an account of the property distrained, a copy of which, signed by the deputy or agent making the distraint, shall be left with the owner or possessor of the property, or at the dwelling or usual place of business of the owner or possessor, with a person of suitable age and discretion, if a person of suitable age and discretion can be found, or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, with an officer, manager, general agent, or agent for process, with a note of the amount demanded and the time and place of sale;

(2) the deputy or agent shall immediately publish a notice of the time and place of sale, together with a description of the property distrained, in a newspaper within the judicial district in which the distraint is made, and, in the discretion of the department, have the notice publicly posted in three public places within five miles of the place where the sale is to be held; and

If land sold is redeemed under this subsection, the commissioner shall cause entry of the fact to be made upon the record mentioned in (g)(6) of this section and the entry shall be evidence of such redemption.

(g) The following provisions apply to sale of property under this section.

(1) In the case of property sold under this section, the deputy or agent conducting the sale shall give to the purchaser a certificate of sale upon payment in full of the purchase price. In the case of real property, the certificate shall set out the real property purchased, for whose taxes the same was sold, the name of the purchaser, and the price paid for it.

(2) In the case of real property sold under this section and not redeemed in the manner and within the time provided in (f) of this section, the commissioner shall execute to the purchaser of the real property at the sale a deed of the real property so purchased, reciting the facts set out in the certificate.

(3) If real property is declared purchased by the deputy or agent for the state at a sale under (e) of this section, the deputy or agent shall at the proper time execute a deed for it after its preparation and the endorsement of approval as to its form by the attorney general and, without delay, cause the deed to be duly recorded in the proper registry of deeds.

(4) In all cases of sale of property under this section other than real property, the certificate of sale

(A) is prima facie evidence of the right of the deputy or agent to make the sale, and conclusive evidence of the regularity of the proceedings in making the sale;

(B) transfers to the purchaser all right, title, and interest of the delinquent in and to the property sold;

(C) where the property consists of stock, is notice, when received, to a corporation, company, or association of the transfer, and is authority to the corporation, company, or association to record the transfer on their books and records in the same manner as if the stock was transferred or assigned by the party holding the stock in lieu of an original or prior certificate, which is void, whether cancelled or not; and

(D) where the subject of sale is security or other evidence of debt, is a good and valid receipt to the person holding it, as against a person holding or claiming to hold possession of the security or other evidence of debt.

(A) the deed of sale given under (2) of this subsection is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in it; and

(B) if the proceedings of the commissioner or a deputy or agent of the commissioner as set out have been substantially in accordance with the provisions of law, the deed is considered and operates as a conveyance of all the right, title, and interest the party delinquent had in and to the real property thus sold at the time the lien of the state attached to it.

(6) The commissioner or a deputy or agent of the commissioner shall keep a record of all sales of real property under this section and of redemption of the property.  The record shall set out the tax for which the sale was made, the date of seizure and sale, the name of the party assessed and all proceedings in making the sale, the amount of expenses, the names of the purchasers, and the date of the deed.  A copy of the record or a part of it certified by the commissioner is evidence in any court of the truth of the facts stated in it.

(h) When property liable to distraint for taxes is not divisible, so as to enable the department by sale of a part of it to raise the whole amount of the tax or deficiency, with all costs and charges, the whole of the property shall be sold, and the surplus of the proceeds of the sale, after making allowance for the amount of the tax or deficiency, interest, penalties, and additions to it and for the costs and charges of the distraint and sale, shall be surrendered to the owner of the property.

(i) If property seized and sold under this section is not sufficient to satisfy the claim of the state for which distraint or seizure is made, the deputy or agent may, thereafter, and as often as is necessary, proceed to seize and sell in like manner any other property liable to seizure of the taxpayer against whom the claim exists until the amount due from the taxpayer, together with all expenses, is fully paid.

(j) A person in possession of property, or rights to property, which is subject to distraint, upon which a levy is made, shall, upon demand by the deputy or agent making the levy, surrender the property or rights to the deputy or agent, unless the property or right is, at the time of the demand, subject to an attachment under judicial process.  A person who fails or refuses to so surrender the property or rights is personally liable to the state in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights not so surrendered, but not exceeding the amount of the taxes or deficiencies, including penalties, and interest, for the collection of which levy is made, together with costs and interest from the date of the levy.

(k) All persons shall, on demand of an agent or deputy about to distrain or having distrained on property, or rights of property, exhibit all books containing evidence or statements relating to the subject of distraint, or the property or rights of property liable to distraint for the tax due.

(l) The department shall by regulation determine the fees and charges to be allowed in cases of distraint, and may determine whether an expense incurred in making a distraint or seizure is necessary.

(m) The period of limitation upon distraint is the same as provided under 26 U.S.C. 6501(c), 6502(a), and 6503(a) (Internal Revenue Code).  In determining the running of a period of limitation in respect of distraint, the distraint is considered to begin when the levy upon property is made.

(n) The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive but are in addition to all other existing remedies provided by law for the enforcement of the revenue laws of the state.

(o) The department may be made a party defendant in an action by a person aggrieved by the unlawful seizure or sale of the person's property, but only the state is responsible for a final money judgment secured against the department, and the judgment shall be satisfied out of the general fund of the state treasury.

(p) The department shall adopt and publish all necessary regulations for the enforcement of this section.

(q) In this section "person" includes an officer or employee of a corporation or a member or employee of a partnership, who as an officer, employee, or member is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.

(B) was eligible for hostile fire or imminent danger pay; and

(2) demonstrates a reasonable cause for the delay in applying for that dividend.

###### Sec. 43.23.015.   Application and proof of eligibility.

(a) The commissioner shall adopt regulations under the Administrative Procedure Act (AS 44.62) for determining the eligibility of individuals for permanent fund dividends. The commissioner may require an individual to provide proof of eligibility, and the commissioner may use other information available from other state departments or agencies to determine the eligibility of an individual. The commissioner shall consider all relevant circumstances in determining the eligibility of an individual. However, the residency of an individual's spouse may not be the principal factor relied upon by the commissioner in determining the residency of the individual.

(b)  The department shall prescribe and furnish an application form for claiming a permanent fund dividend. The application must include

(1) notice of the penalties provided for under AS 43.23.270;

(2) a statement of eligibility and a certification of residency;

(3) the means for an applicant eligible to vote under AS 15.05, or a person authorized to act on behalf of the applicant, to furnish information required by AS 15.07.060(a)(1)ยง(4) and (7)ยง(9), and an attestation that such information is true.

(c) Except as provided in (d) of this section or as may be provided by regulations adopted by the department, an individual must personally sign the application for permanent fund dividends, including the certification of residency required under (b) of this section.

(d) The application and certification of residency of an unemancipated individual under 18 years of age or of a disabled or an incompetent individual must be signed by the individual's parent, legal guardian, or other authorized representative. An individual may complete, sign, and file an application on behalf of a member of the armed forces of the United States who is serving on active duty outside of the United States if the individual has a power of attorney from the member of the armed forces that authorizes, in specific or general terms, the individual to file that application.

(e) If a public agency claims a permanent fund dividend on behalf of an individual, the public agency shall hold the dividend in trust for the individual. Money held in trust under this subsection shall be invested by the commissioner in accordance with AS 37.10.070.

(f) A minor or a disabled or an incompetent individual may not maintain a claim against the state or an officer or employee of the state based on the manner in which the parent, guardian, or authorized representative other than a public agency of the state managed or disposed of permanent fund dividends received on behalf of the minor or disabled or incompetent individual.

(g) If an individual is aggrieved by a decision of the department determining the individual's eligibility for a permanent fund dividend or the individual's authority to claim a permanent fund dividend on behalf of another, the individual may, upon payment of a $25 appeal fee, request the department to review its decision. Within 12 months after the administrative appeal is filed, the department shall provide the individual with a final written decision. If the individual is aggrieved by the decision of the department after all administrative proceedings, the individual may appeal that decision to the superior court in accordance with AS 44.62.560. An appeal to the court under this section does not entitle the aggrieved individual to a trial de novo. The appeal shall be based on the record of the administrative proceeding from which appeal is taken and the scope of appeal is limited to matters contained in the record of the administrative proceeding. If, as a result of an administrative proceeding or a court appeal, the individual prevails, the $25 appeal fee shall be returned to the individual by the department.

(h) The penalty and enforcement provisions of AS 43.23.270 apply to an individual who claims a permanent fund dividend on behalf of another.

(i) An indigent individual may apply for a waiver of the appeal fee required under (g) of this section. The department shall prescribe and furnish a form for that purpose. The department shall grant the waiver if, during the year immediately preceding the year the form is submitted to the department, the individual was a member of a family with an income equal to or less than the federal poverty guidelines for Alaska set by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.

(j) The application form for claiming a permanent fund dividend must include a place for the applicant to voluntarily indicate that the applicant is a veteran, the branch of service, including the Alaska Territorial Guard, and the dates of service. Notwithstanding AS 43.23.110, the department shall release information provided under this subsection to the Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs and may not otherwise release the information. The Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs may only release the information to congressionally chartered veterans service organizations in the state. The application form must contain notice that providing the information under this subsection is voluntary, that the information will be released as provided in this subsection, and that the veterans service organizations are not required to keep it confidential.

(c) A person who, without just cause, fails or refuses to produce books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, and other records, if it is in the person's power to do so, in obedience to a subpoena of the department or an authorized representative of it, upon conviction, is punishable by a fine of not more than $200, or by imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or by both. Each day the failure or refusal continues is a separate offense.

###### Sec. 43.23.270.   Penalties and enforcement.

(a) In addition to any criminal penalties imposed by state law, if an individual is convicted of a crime in connection with a false statement made in a certification required under AS 43.23.015, and the conviction is not reversed, that individual forfeits all permanent fund dividends paid and is not eligible for a future permanent fund dividend.

(b) If the commissioner determines that a permanent fund dividend should not have been claimed by or paid to an individual, the commissioner may use all collection procedures or remedies available for collection of taxes under this title to recover the payment of a permanent fund dividend that was improperly made. A notice of an improperly paid dividend must be sent to the individual within

(1) three years after the improper payment is sent; or

(2) six years after the improper payment is sent if the commissioner determines that the individual exercised gross negligence or recklessly disregarded a material fact in connection with a false statement made in an application.

(c) In addition to any criminal penalties imposed by state law, if the department finds that an individual, in claiming a permanent fund dividend, or an individual, in certifying another person's eligibility, wilfully misrepresents, exercises gross negligence with respect to, or recklessly disregards a material fact pertaining to, eligibility, the department may issue an order against the individual for the

(1) forfeiture of the dividend;

(2) imposition of a civil fine of up to $3,000; and

(3) loss of eligibility to receive the next five dividends following the forfeited dividend.

(d) If notice is not sent within the time required under (b) of this section, administrative or judicial proceedings may not be commenced for recovery of an improperly paid dividend. The time limitations of (b) of this section do not apply if a dividend is forfeited under (a) of this section or if it is more probable than not that an individual has committed a crime in connection with a false statement made in an application.

(e) The provisions of AS 43.23.015(g) and (i) apply to a request for review of, and to appeal of, a decision under (c) of this section by an individual aggrieved by the decision.

(1) Determine the amount of the credit allowable under the applicable federal revenue Act for estate, inheritance, legacy, and succession taxes actually paid to the several states.

(2) Determine for each of the other states the amount of all constitutionally valid estate, inheritance, legacy, and succession taxes, actually paid to each of the other states in respect to property owned by the decedent or subject to these taxes as a part of or in connection with the decedent's estate.

(a) A tax is imposed upon the transfer of real property situated and tangible personal property having an actual situs in this state and upon intangible personal property physically present in this state of a person who at the time of death was not a resident of the United States, the amount of which is a sum equal to that proportion of the credit allowable under the applicable federal revenue Act for estate, inheritance, legacy, and succession taxes actually paid to the several states, as the value of the property taxable in this state bears to the value of the estate taxable by the United States wherever situated.

The amount receivable as insurance upon the life of a decedent who at the time of death was not a resident of the United States, and any money deposited with a person carrying on the banking business by or for the decedent who was not engaged in business in the United States at the time of death, is not for the purpose of this section, considered to be physically present in this state.

###### Sec. 43.31.041.   Administration by Department of Revenue.

(b) If a person subpoenaed to appear under this chapter to testify, or to produce books, papers, or other data, refuses to do so, the superior court in the judicial district in which the person resides has jurisdiction by appropriate process to compel the attendance, testimony, or production of books, papers, or other data.

###### Sec. 43.31.061.   Appointment, bonds and credentials of agents.

(a) The department may appoint and remove examiners and appraisers it considers necessary, these persons to have those duties and powers the department prescribes.

###### Sec. 43.31.111.   Notice of death or tax return.

The executor, within two months after the decedent's death, or within a like period after qualifying as executor, shall submit a report of the death to the department on the form prepared and published by the department known as the preliminary notice and report. If a federal estate tax return is required by the applicable federal revenue Act, a copy of the preliminary notice filed with the federal government may be filed with the department in place of the preliminary notice and report.

###### Sec. 43.31.121.   Tax return in certain cases.

The executor of an estate required by the laws of the United States to file a federal estate tax return shall file with the department within 15 months from the date of death a return consisting of an executed copy of the federal estate tax return, and shall file with this return all supplemental data, if any, as may be necessary to determine and establish the correct tax under this chapter.  This return shall be made in the case of every decedent who at the time of death was not a resident of the United States and whose gross estate includes any real property situated and tangible personal property having an actual situs in the state and intangible personal property physically present in the state.

###### Sec. 43.31.131.   Failure to make return and extension.

If the federal taxing authorities grant an extension of time for filing a return the department shall allow a like extension of time for filing upon the filing by the executor of a copy of the federal extension with the department.  An extension of time for filing a return does not operate to extend the time for payment of the tax.  If a person fails to file a return at the time prescribed by law or files, wilfully or otherwise, a false or fraudulent return, the department shall make the return from its own knowledge and from information it can obtain through testimony or otherwise.  A return so made by the department shall be prima facie good and sufficient for all legal purposes.

###### Sec. 43.31.141.   When tax due, extension and interest.

The tax imposed by this chapter is due and payable 15 months after the decedent's death and shall be paid by the executor to the department. If the department finds that the payment on the due date of tax or any part of the tax would impose undue hardship upon the estate, the department may extend the time for payment of any part, but no extension may be for more than one year and the aggregate of extensions with respect to an estate may not exceed five years from the due date. In that case, the amount in respect of which the extension is granted shall be paid on or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension unless a further extension is granted. If the time for the payment is extended, there shall be collected, as part of this amount, interest on the tax as provided in AS 43.05.225(1) from the due date of the tax to the date the tax is paid.

###### Sec. 43.31.151.   Notice of deficiency in federal estate tax.

It is the duty of the executor to file with the department within 60 days after a final determination of a deficiency in federal estate tax has been made, written notice of the deficiency.  If, based upon this deficiency and the ground for it, it appears that the amount of tax previously paid is less than the amount of tax owing, the difference together with interest at the rate of seven percent a year from the due date of the tax shall be paid upon notice and demand by the department. If the executor fails to give the notice required by this section, any additional tax owing may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of the tax may be begun without assessment at any time before the filing of notice or within 30 days after the delinquent filing of notice, notwithstanding the provisions of AS 43.05.260.

###### Sec. 43.31.161.   Deficiency, hearing, and procedure. [Repealed,ยง3 ch 166 SLA 1976.  For taxpayer remedies, see AS 43.05.240.]

###### Sec. 43.31.181.   Receipts for taxes.

The department shall issue to the executor, upon payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, receipts in triplicate, any of which is sufficient evidence of payment, and shall entitle the executor to be credited and allowed the amount of the receipt by a court having jurisdiction to audit or settle the accounts of the executor.  If the executor files a complete return and makes written application to the department for determination of the amount of the tax and discharge from personal liability, the department, as soon as possible, and in any event within one year after receipt of the application, shall notify the executor of the amount of the tax, and upon payment of the tax the executor shall be discharged from personal liability for any additional tax thereafter found to be due, and is entitled to receive from the department a receipt in writing showing the discharge; however, the discharge does not operate to release the gross estate of the lien of additional tax that may thereafter be found to be due, while the title to the gross estate remains in the executor or in the heirs, devisees, or distributees; but after the discharge is given, no part of the gross estate is subject to lien or to any claim or demand for tax after the title to the estate has passed to a bona fide purchaser for value.

###### Sec. 43.31.191.   Failure to pay tax.

(a) If a tax imposed by this chapter or any portion of the tax is unpaid within 90 days after it becomes due, and the time for payment is not extended, the department shall collect the tax, penalty and interest by using the remedy of distraint on real and personal property as set out in AS 43.20.270 or by issuing a warrant directed to the commissioner of public safety commanding the commissioner to

(1) levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the estate found in the state for the payment of the amount of the unpaid tax with interest and penalties, if any, as may have accrued or been assessed against it, together with the cost of executing the warrant; and

(2) return the warrant to the department and pay to it the money collected under it by a time to be specified in the warrant, not less than 60 days from the date of the warrant.

(b) The commissioner of public safety shall proceed upon the warrant in all respects, with like effect, in the manner prescribed by law for executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record.  Alias and pluries warrants may issue from time to time as the department considers proper until the entire amount of the tax, deficiency, interest, penalties and costs have been recovered.

###### Sec. 43.31.201.   Tax payable from entire estates and third persons.

If the tax or a part of the tax is paid or collected out of that part of the estate passing to or in possession of a person other than the executor in the capacity of executor, the person is entitled to a reimbursement out of a part of the estate still undistributed or by a just and equitable contribution by the person whose interest in the estate of the decedent would have been reduced if the tax had been paid before the distribution of the estate or whose interest in the estate is subject to an equal or prior liability for the payment of tax, debts, or other charges against the estate, it being the purpose and intent of this section that so far as is practical and unless otherwise directed by the will of the decedent, the tax shall be paid out of the estate before its distribution; but the department is not charged with enforcing contribution from a person.

###### Sec. 43.31.211.   Lien for unpaid taxes. [Repealed,ยง4 ch 94 SLA 1976.  For current law, see AS 43.10.035(a).]

###### Sec. 43.31.221.   Personal liability of executor.

If an executor makes distribution either in whole or in part of any of the property of an estate to the heirs, next of kin, distributees, legatees or devisees without having paid or secured the tax due the state under this chapter, or obtained the release of the property from the lien of the tax the executor becomes personally liable for the tax so due the state, or so much of it as remains due and unpaid, to the full extent of the full value of any property belonging to the person or estate which may come into the hands, custody, or control of the executor.

###### Sec. 43.31.230.   Sale of real estate by executor to pay tax.

Every executor has the same right and power to take possession of or sell, convey and dispose of real estate as assets of the estate for the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter as the executor may have for the payment of the debts of the decedent.

###### Sec. 43.31.240.   Actions to enforce payment.

Actions may be brought within the time or times specified in this chapter by the department to recover the amount of taxes, penalties and interest due under this chapter.  The action shall be brought in the superior court where the estate is being or has been administered, or if no administration is had in this state, then in the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where any of the property of the estate is situated.

###### Sec. 43.31.250.   No discharge of executor until tax paid.

No final account of an executor of the estate of a nonresident, nor of the estate of a resident where the value of the gross estate wherever situated exceeds $60,000 may be allowed by any court until the account shows, and the judge of the court finds, that the tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter upon the executor, which has become payable, has been paid.  The certificate of the department of nonliability for tax or its receipt for the amount of tax certified is conclusive in proceedings as to the liability or the payment of the tax to the extent of the certificate.

###### Sec. 43.31.260.   Agreements as to tax due.

For the purpose of facilitating the settlement and distribution of estates held by executors, the department may, on behalf of the state, agree upon the amount of taxes at any time due or to become due from the executor under the provisions of this chapter, and payment in accordance with the agreement is full satisfaction of the taxes to which the agreement relates.

###### Sec. 43.31.270.   Time for assessment of tax. [Repealed,ยง4 ch 94 SLA 1976. For current law, see AS 43.05.260.]

###### Sec. 43.31.280.   Refunds of excess tax paid.

(a) When it appears upon the examination of a return made under this chapter or upon proof submitted to the department by the executor, that an amount of estate tax has been paid in excess of the tax legally due under this chapter, then the amount of overpayment, together with any overpayment of interest on it shall be refunded to the executor and this refund shall be made by the department as a matter of course regardless of whether the executor has filed a written claim for it, except that upon request of the department, the executor shall file with the department a conformed copy of any written claim for refund of federal estate tax which has been filed with the United States.

(b) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, no refund of estate tax may be made nor is any executor entitled to bring an action for refund of estate tax after the expiration of two years from the date of payment of the tax to be refunded unless there has been filed with the department written notice of administrative or judicial determination of the federal estate tax liability of the estate, whichever occurs last, and notice shall have been so filed not later than 60 days after determination has become final.

(c) In this section, an administrative determination shall be considered to have become final on the date of receipt by the executor or other interested party of the final payment to be made refunding federal estate tax or upon the last date on which the executor or any other interested party receives notice from the United States that an overpayment of federal estate tax has been credited by the United States against any liability other than federal estate tax of the estate.  A final judicial determination shall be considered to have occurred on the date on which a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction and determining that there has been an overpayment of federal estate tax becomes final.

(d) Nothing in this section prevents an executor from bringing or maintaining an action in a court of competent jurisdiction within a period otherwise prescribed by law to determine any question bearing upon the taxable situs of property, the domicile of a decedent, or otherwise affecting the jurisdiction of the state to impose an inheritance or estate tax with respect to a particular item of property.

The report shall contain any other information which the judge may have concerning the estate of these decedents.  The judge shall also furnish immediately further information, from the records and files of the judge's office in regard to the estates, which the department may from time to time require.

###### Sec. 43.31.300.   Corporate executors of nonresident decedents.

If the executor of the estate of a nonresident is a corporation duly authorized, qualified, and acting as an executor in the jurisdiction of the domicile of the decedent, it is under the duties and obligations as to the giving of notices and filing of returns required by this chapter, and may bring and defend actions and suits as authorized or permitted by this chapter, to the same extent as an individual executor, notwithstanding that the corporation may be prohibited from exercising, in this state, any powers as executor, but nothing in this section authorizes corporations not authorized to do business in this state to qualify or act as executor, administrator, or in any other fiduciary capacity, if otherwise prohibited by the laws of this state, except to the extent expressly provided.

###### Sec. 43.31.310.   Prima facie liability for tax.

The estate of each decedent whose property is subject to the laws of the state is considered prima facie liable for estate taxes under this chapter, and is subject to a lien for them in an amount which may be later determined to be due and payable on the estate as provided in this chapter.  The presumption of liability begins on the date of the death of the decedent and continues until the full settlement of all taxes which may be found to be due under this chapter, the settlement to be shown by receipts for all taxes due to be issued by the department as provided for in this chapter.  Whenever it appears to the department that an estate is not subject to a tax under this chapter the department shall issue to the executor, administrator, curator or other personal representative, or to the heirs, devisees, or legatees of the decedent, a certificate in writing to that effect, showing nonliability to tax, which certificate of nonliability has the same effect as a receipt showing payment.  The certificate of nonliability is subject to record and admissible in evidence in like manner as receipts showing payment of taxes.  There shall be paid to the department a fee of $2.50 for each certificate so issued.

###### Sec. 43.31.320.   Discharge of estate; notice of lien, limitation, etc.

(a) If no receipt for the payment of taxes, or no receipt of nonliability for taxes has been issued or recorded as provided for in this chapter, the property constituting the estate of the decedent in this state shall be considered fully acquitted and discharged of all liability for estate and inheritance taxes under this chapter after a lapse of 10 years from the date of the filing with the department of notice of the decedent's death, or after a lapse of 10 years from the date of the filing with the department of an estate tax return, whichever date is earlier, unless the department makes out, files and has recorded with the appropriate recorder wherein any part of the estate of the decedent may be situated in this state, a notice of lien against the property of the estate, specifying the amount or approximate amount of taxes claimed to be due to the state under this chapter, which notice of lien continues the lien in force for an additional period of five years or until payment is made. Notice of lien shall be filed and recorded; however, if no receipt for the payment of taxes, or no certificate of nonliability for taxes, has been issued or recorded as provided for in this chapter, the property constituting the estate of the decedent in this state, if the decedent was a resident of this state at the time of death, shall be considered fully acquitted and discharged of all liability for tax under this chapter after a lapse of 10 years from the date of the death of the decedent, unless the department makes out, files and has recorded notice of lien as provided in this chapter, which notice continues the lien in force against the property of the estate for an additional period of five years or until payment is made.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section or this chapter, no lien for estate and inheritance taxes under this chapter may continue for more than 20 years from the date of death of the decedent, whether the decedent is a resident or nonresident of this state.

A person who fails to comply with any duty imposed upon the person by this chapter, or who, having possession or control of any record, file or paper, containing or supposed to contain information concerning the estate of the decedent, or having possession or control of any property comprised in the gross estate of the decedent, fails to exhibit it upon request to the department or an examiner or appraiser, appointed under this chapter, who desires to examine it in the performance of official duties under this chapter, is liable to a penalty of not more than $1,000, with costs of suit, in a civil action in the name of the state.

###### Secs. 43.31.360 ยง43.31.390.   Failure to make return; false return or return statement; tax evasion. [Repealed,ยง46 ch 113 SLA 1980.  For criminal penalties, see AS 43.05.290.]

###### Sec. 43.31.400.   Effectiveness of chapter.

This chapter shall remain in force and effect so long as the government of the United States retains in full force and effect as a part of the revenue laws of the United States a federal estate tax, and this chapter shall cease to be operative when the government of the United States ceases to impose an estate tax of the United States.

###### Sec. 43.31.410.   Exemptions.

###### Sec. 43.55.014.   Payment in gas of tax for gas.

(a) For gas produced on and after January 1, 2022, other than gas described in (e) of this section, the department shall allow a producer to make an election, under regulations adopted by the department, to pay in gas the production tax levied by this section in lieu of the tax otherwise levied for the gas by AS 43.55.011(e). An election under this subsection applies only to gas produced from oil and gas leases modified under AS 38.05.180(hh) from which the commissioner of natural resources has determined to take royalty gas in kind under AS 38.05.182.

(b) A production tax levied by this section is equal to 13 percent of the gas otherwise taxable under AS 43.55.011(e)(3) produced from each oil and gas lease to which an effective election under (a) of this section applies, when and as that gas is produced. The producer shall pay the tax in gas by delivering that 13 percent of the gas to the state at the point of production.

(c) The Department of Natural Resources shall manage under AS 38.05.020(b)(14) the custody and disposition of gas delivered to the state under (b) of this section.

(d) An assessment under AS 43.05.245 against a producer for an underpayment of a tax levied by this section may be made in terms of an amount of gas or an amount of money, as determined under regulations adopted by the department. If the assessment is made in terms of money, the amount for a month of production for an oil and gas lease subject to an effective election under (a) of this section is the product of the number of units of gas by which the producer's delivery to the state was less than the amount required by (b) of this section, multiplied by the average gross value at the point of production for each unit of the gas produced by the producer from the lease during the month other than gas that was not subject to tax or gas that was delivered to the state under (b) of this section. The department may allow a credit or refund under AS 43.05.275 for an overpayment of a tax levied by this section that may be issued in the form of gas or money, as determined under regulations adopted by the department. If the credit or refund is allowed in terms of money, the amount of the credit or refund for a month of production for an oil and gas lease subject to an effective election under (a) of this section is the product of the number of units of gas by which the producer's delivery to the state was more than the amount required under (b) of this section, multiplied by the average gross value at the point of production for each unit of the gas produced by the producer from the lease during the month other than gas that was not subject to tax or gas that was delivered to the state under (b) of this section. Interest that is determined as a percentage of the amount of a tax underpayment or overpayment and a penalty that is a percentage of the amount of a tax underpayment are calculated as a percentage of the amount of money determined in this subsection. An amount of gas that was less than the amount required to be delivered to the state under (b) of this section or an amount of gas that was more than the amount required to be delivered to the state under (b) of this section that is adjusted as provided by a gas balancing agreement to which the state is a party under AS 38.05.020(b)(11) is not subject to assessment under AS 43.05.245 or a credit or refund under AS 43.05.275. In this subsection, "unit" means a unit of measurement for gas identified by the department under regulations adopted by the department and may be expressed as 1,000 cubic feet, 1,000,000 British thermal units, or another appropriate unit of measurement specified by the department under regulations adopted by the department.

(e) This section does not apply to gas that, under AS 43.55.020(e), is considered as gas produced from a lease or property for the purpose of AS 43.55.011ยง43.55.180.

(d) [Repealed, ยง33, ch. 10, SLA 2013.]

(e) Gas flared, released, or allowed to escape in excess of the amount authorized by the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission is considered, for the purpose of AS 43.55.011ยง43.55.180, as gas produced from a lease or property. Oil or gas used in the operation of a lease or property in the state in drilling for or producing oil or gas, or for repressuring, except to the extent determined by the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to be waste, is not considered, for the purpose of AS 43.55.011ยง43.55.180, as oil or gas produced from a lease or property.

(f) If oil or gas is produced but not sold, gas is produced but is stored in a gas storage facility, or oil or gas is produced and sold under circumstances where the sale price does not represent the prevailing value for oil or gas of like kind, character, or quality in the field or area from which the product is produced, the department may require the tax to be paid upon the basis of the value of oil or gas of the same kind, quality, and character prevailing for that field or area during the calendar month of production or sale.

(g) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of AS 43.05.225,

(1) before January 1, 2014, an unpaid amount of an installment payment required under (a)(1)ยง(3) of this section that is not paid when due bears interest (A) at the rate provided for an underpayment under 26 U.S.C. 6621 (Internal Revenue Code), as amended, compounded daily, from the date the installment payment is due until March 31 following the calendar year of production, and (B) as provided for a delinquent tax under AS 43.05.225 after that March 31; interest accrued under (A) of this paragraph that remains unpaid after that March 31 is treated as an addition to tax that bears interest under (B) of this paragraph; an unpaid amount of tax due under (a)(4) of this section that is not paid when due bears interest as provided for a delinquent tax under AS 43.05.225;

(2) on and after January 1, 2014, an unpaid amount of an installment payment required under (a)(3), (5), (6), or (7) of this section that is not paid when due bears interest (A) at the rate provided for an underpayment under 26 U.S.C. 6621 (Internal Revenue Code), as amended, compounded daily, from the date the installment payment is due until March 31 following the calendar year of production, and (B) as provided for a delinquent tax under AS 43.05.225 after that March 31; interest accrued under (A) of this paragraph that remains unpaid after that March 31 is treated as an addition to tax that bears interest under (B) of this paragraph; an unpaid amount of tax due under (a)(4) of this section that is not paid when due bears interest as provided for a delinquent tax under AS 43.05.225.

(h) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of AS 43.05.280,

(1) an overpayment of an installment payment required under (a)(1), (2), (3), (5), (6), or (7) of this section bears interest at the rate provided for an overpayment under 26 U.S.C. 6621 (Internal Revenue Code), as amended, compounded daily, from the later of the date the installment payment is due or the date the overpayment is made, until the earlier of

(A) the date it is refunded or is applied to an underpayment; or

(B) March 31 following the calendar year of production;

(2) except as provided under (1) of this subsection, interest with respect to an overpayment is allowed only on any net overpayment of the payments required under (a) of this section that remains after the later of March 31 following the calendar year of production or the date that the statement required under AS 43.55.030(a) is filed;

(3) interest is allowed under (2) of this subsection only from a date that is 90 days after the later of March 31 following the calendar year of production or the date that the statement required under AS 43.55.030(a) is filed; interest is not allowed if the overpayment was refunded within the 90-day period;

(4) interest under (2) and (3) of this subsection is paid at the rate and in the manner provided in AS 43.05.225(1).

(i) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of AS 43.05.225 or (g) or (h) of this section, if the amount of a tax payment, including an installment payment, due under (a)(1)ยง(4) of this section is affected by the retroactive application of a regulation adopted under this chapter, the department shall determine whether the retroactive application of the regulation caused an underpayment or an overpayment of the amount due and adjust the interest due on the affected payment as follows:

(1) if an underpayment of the amount due occurred, the department shall waive interest that would otherwise accrue for the underpayment before the first day of the second month following the month in which the regulation became effective, if

(A) the department determines that the producer's underpayment resulted because the regulation was not in effect when the payment was due; and

(B) the producer demonstrates that it made a good faith estimate of its tax obligation in light of the regulations then in effect when the payment was due and paid the estimated tax;

(2) if an overpayment of the amount due occurred and the department determines that the producer's overpayment resulted because the regulation was not in effect when the payment was due, the obligation for a refund for the overpayment does not begin to accrue interest earlier than the following, as applicable:

(A) except as otherwise provided under (B) of this paragraph, the first day of the second month following the month in which the regulation became effective;

(B) 90 days after an amended statement under AS 43.55.030(a) and an application to request a refund of production tax paid is filed, if the overpayment was for a period for which an amended statement under AS 43.55.030(a) was required to be filed before the regulation became effective.

(j) Cushion gas in a gas storage facility is not considered to be gas used in the operation of a lease or property or gas used for repressuring as described in (e) of this section. Gas withdrawn from a gas storage facility regulated under AS 42.05 is considered to be non-native gas until all non-native gas injected into the gas storage facility has been withdrawn from the gas storage facility. Non-native gas withdrawn from a gas storage facility is not considered to be gas produced for the purposes of AS 43.55.011ยง43.55.180. Gas withdrawn from a gas storage facility after all non-native gas previously injected into the gas storage facility has been withdrawn is gas considered to be produced from the lease or property for the purposes of AS 43.55.011ยง43.55.180. In this subsection, "native gas" and "non-native gas" have the meanings given in AS 31.05.032.

(k) For oil and gas produced on and after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2022, in making settlement with the royalty owner for oil and gas that is taxable under AS 43.55.011, the producer may deduct the amount of the tax paid on taxable royalty oil and gas, or may deduct taxable royalty oil or gas equivalent in value at the time the tax becomes due to the amount of the tax paid. If the total deductions of installment payments of estimated tax for a calendar year exceed the actual tax for that calendar year, the producer shall, before April 1 of the following year, refund the excess to the royalty owner. Unless otherwise agreed between the producer and the royalty owner, the amount of the tax paid under AS 43.55.011(e) on taxable royalty oil and gas for a calendar year, other than oil and gas the ownership or right to which constitutes a landowner's royalty interest, is considered to be the gross value at the point of production of the taxable royalty oil and gas produced during the calendar year multiplied by a figure that is a quotient, in which

(1) the numerator is the producer's total tax liability under AS 43.55.011(e)(2) for the calendar year of production; and

(2) the denominator is the total gross value at the point of production of the oil and gas taxable under AS 43.55.011(e) produced by the producer from all leases and properties in the state during the calendar year.

(l) For oil and gas produced on and after January 1, 2022, in making settlement with the royalty owner for oil and gas that is taxable under AS 43.55.011, the producer may deduct the amount of the tax paid on taxable royalty oil and gas, or may deduct taxable royalty oil or gas equivalent in value at the time the tax becomes due to the amount of the tax paid. If the total deductions of installment payments of estimated tax for a calendar year exceed the actual tax for that calendar year, the producer shall, before April 1 of the following year, refund the excess to the royalty owner. In making settlement with the royalty owner for gas that is taxable under AS 43.55.014, the producer may deduct the amount of the gas paid as in-kind tax on taxable royalty gas or may deduct the gross value at the point of production of the gas paid as in-kind tax on taxable royalty gas. Unless otherwise agreed between the producer and the royalty owner, the amount of the tax paid under AS 43.55.011(e) on taxable royalty oil for a calendar year, other than oil the ownership or right to which constitutes a landowner's royalty interest, is considered to be the gross value at the point of production of the taxable royalty oil produced during the calendar year multiplied by a figure that is a quotient, in which

(1) the numerator is the producer's total tax liability under AS 43.55.011(e)(3)(A) for the calendar year of production; and

(2) the denominator is the total gross value at the point of production of the oil taxable under AS 43.55.011(e) produced by the producer from all leases and properties in the state during the calendar year.

###### Sec. 43.55.023.   Tax credits for certain losses and expenditures.

(a) A producer or explorer may take a tax credit for a qualified capital expenditure as follows:

(1) notwithstanding that a qualified capital expenditure may be a deductible lease expenditure for purposes of calculating the production tax value of oil and gas under AS 43.55.160(a), unless a credit for that expenditure is taken under former AS 43.20.043 or AS 43.55.025, a producer or explorer that incurs a qualified capital expenditure may also elect to apply a tax credit against a tax levied by AS 43.55.011(e) in the amount of 10 percent of that expenditure;

(2) a producer or explorer may take a credit for a qualified capital expenditure incurred in connection with geological or geophysical exploration or in connection with an exploration well only if the producer or explorer

(A) agrees, in writing, to the applicable provisions of AS 43.55.025(f)(2); and

(B) submits to the Department of Natural Resources all data that would be required to be submitted under AS 43.55.025(f)(2);

(B) in the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin may be taken only if the expenditure is incurred before January 1, 2018.

(b) [Repealed,ยง30 ch 3 SSSLA 2017.]

(c) A credit or portion of a credit under this section

(1) may not be used to reduce a person's tax liability under AS 43.55.011(e) for any calendar year below zero;

(2)  may, if not used under this subsection, be applied in a later calendar year;

(3)  may, regardless of when the credit was earned, be used to satisfy a tax, interest, penalty, fee, or other charge that

(A)  is related to the tax due under this chapter for a prior year, except for a surcharge under AS 43.55.201ยง43.55.299 or 43.55.300 or the tax levied by AS 43.55.011(i) or 43.55.014; and

(B)  has not, for the purpose of art. IX, sec. 17(a), Constitution of the State of Alaska, been subject to an administrative proceeding or litigation.

(d) A person that is entitled to take a tax credit under this section that wishes to transfer the unused credit to another person or, for a credit for a lease expenditure incurred before July 1, 2017, obtain a cash payment under AS 43.55.028 may apply to the department for a transferable tax credit certificate. An application under this subsection must be in a form prescribed by the department and must include supporting information and documentation that the department reasonably requires. The department shall grant or deny an application, or grant an application as to a lesser amount than that claimed and deny it as to the excess, not later than 120 days after the latest of (1) March 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the qualified capital expenditure or carried-forward annual loss for which the credit is claimed was incurred; (2) the date the statement required under AS 43.55.030(a) or (e) was filed for the calendar year in which the qualified capital expenditure or carried-forward annual loss for which the credit is claimed was incurred; or (3) the date the application was received by the department. If, based on the information then available to it, the department is reasonably satisfied that the applicant is entitled to a credit, the department shall issue the applicant a transferable tax credit certificate for the amount of the credit. A certificate issued under this subsection does not expire.

(e) A person to which a transferable tax credit certificate is issued under (d) of this section may transfer the certificate to another person, and a transferee may further transfer the certificate. Subject to the limitations set out in (a)ยง(d) of this section, and notwithstanding any action the department may take with respect to the applicant under (g) of this section, the owner of a certificate may apply the credit or a portion of the credit shown on the certificate

(1) against a tax levied by AS 43.55.011(e); however, a credit shown on a transferable tax credit certificate may not be applied under this paragraph to reduce a transferee's total tax liability under AS 43.55.011(e) for oil and gas produced during a calendar year to less than 80 percent of the tax that would otherwise be due without applying that credit; any portion of a credit not used under this paragraph may be applied in a later period; or

(2)  regardless of when the credit was earned, to satisfy a tax, interest, penalty, fee, or other charge that

(A)  is related to the tax due under this chapter, except for a surcharge under AS 43.55.201ยง43.55.299 or 43.55.300 or the tax levied by AS 43.55.011(i) or 43.55.014;

(B)  is for a calendar year before the year in which the certificate is applied; and

(C)  has not, for the purpose of art. IX, sec. 17(a), Constitution of the State of Alaska, been subject to an administrative proceeding or litigation.

(f) [Repealed,ยง67 ch 1 SSSLA 2007.]

(g) The issuance of a transferable tax credit certificate under (d) of this section or former (m) of this section or the purchase of a certificate under AS 43.55.028 does not limit the department's ability to later audit a tax credit claim to which the certificate relates or to adjust the claim if the department determines, as a result of the audit, that the applicant was not entitled to the amount of the credit for which the certificate was issued. The tax liability of the applicant under AS 43.55.011(e) and 43.55.017ยง43.55.180 is increased by the amount of the credit that exceeds that to which the applicant was entitled, or the applicant's available valid outstanding credits applicable against the tax levied by AS 43.55.011(e) are reduced by that amount. If the applicant's tax liability is increased under this subsection, the increase bears interest under AS 43.05.225 from the date the transferable tax credit certificate was issued. For purposes of this subsection, an applicant that is an explorer is considered a producer subject to the tax levied by AS 43.55.011(e).

(h) Regulations adopted to implement this section must include provisions prescribing reporting, record keeping, and certification procedures and requirements to verify the accuracy of credits claimed and to ensure that a credit is not used more than once.

(k) An entity that is exempt from taxation under this chapter may not apply for a transferable tax credit certificate.

(l) A producer or explorer may apply for a tax credit for a well lease expenditure incurred in the state south of 68 degrees North latitude after June 30, 2010, as follows:

(1) notwithstanding that a well lease expenditure incurred in the state south of 68 degrees North latitude may be a deductible lease expenditure for purposes of calculating the production tax value of oil and gas under AS 43.55.160(a), unless a credit for that expenditure is taken under (a) of this section, AS 43.20.043, or AS 43.55.025, a producer or explorer that incurs a well lease expenditure in the state south of 68 degrees North latitude may elect to apply a tax credit against a tax levied by AS 43.55.011(e) in the amount of

(a) For a calendar year for which a producer's tax liability under AS 43.55.011(e) on oil and gas produced from leases or properties outside the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin, no part of which is north of 68 degrees North latitude, exceeds zero before application of any credits under this chapter, a producer that is qualified under (e) of this section may apply a tax credit against that liability of not more than $6,000,000.

(b) A producer may not take a tax credit under (a) of this section for any calendar year after the later of

(1) 2016; or

(2) the ninth calendar year after the calendar year during which the producer first has commercial oil or gas production before May 1, 2016, from at least one lease or property in the state outside the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin, no part of which is north of 68 degrees North latitude, if the producer did not have commercial oil or gas production from a lease or property in the state outside the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin, no part of which is north of 68 degrees North latitude, before April 1, 2006.

(c) For a calendar year for which a producer's tax liability under AS 43.55.011(e) exceeds zero before application of any credits under this chapter, other than a credit under (a) of this section but after application of any credit under (a) of this section, a producer that is qualified under (e) of this section and whose average amount of oil and gas produced a day and taxable under AS 43.55.011(e) is less than 100,000 BTU equivalent barrels a day may apply a tax credit under this subsection against that liability. A producer whose average amount of oil and gas produced a day and taxable under AS 43.55.011(e) is

(1) not more than 50,000 BTU equivalent barrels may apply a tax credit of not more than $12,000,000 for the calendar year;

(2) more than 50,000 and less than 100,000 BTU equivalent barrels may apply a tax credit of not more than $12,000,000 multiplied by the following fraction for the calendar year:

1 - [2 X (AP - 50,000)]ยง100,000 where AP = the average amount of oil and gas taxable under AS 43.55.011(e), produced a day during the calendar year in BTU equivalent barrels.

(d) A producer may not take a tax credit under (c) of this section for any calendar year after the later of

(1) 2016; or

(2) if the producer did not have commercial oil or gas production from a lease or property in the state before April 1, 2006, the ninth calendar year after the calendar year during which the producer first has commercial oil or gas production before May 1, 2016, from at least one lease or property in the state.

(e) On written application by a producer that includes any information the department may require, the department shall determine whether the producer qualifies for a calendar year under (a) and (c) of this section. To qualify under (a) and (c) of this section, a producer must demonstrate that its operation in the state or its ownership of an interest in a lease or property in the state as a distinct producer would not result in the division among multiple producer entities of any production tax liability under AS 43.55.011(e) that reasonably would be expected to be attributed to a single producer if the tax credit provisions of (a) or (c) of this section did not exist.

(f) A tax credit authorized by (a) of this section may not be applied to reduce a producer's tax liability for any calendar year under AS 43.55.011(e) on oil and gas produced from leases or properties outside the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin, no part of which is north of 68 degrees North latitude, below zero.

(g) A tax credit authorized by (c) of this section may not be applied to reduce a producer's tax liability for any calendar year under AS 43.55.011(e) below zero.

(h) An unused tax credit or portion of a tax credit under this section is not transferable and may not be carried forward for use in a later calendar year.

(i) A producer may apply against the producer's tax liability for the calendar year under AS 43.55.011(e) a tax credit of $5 for each barrel of oil taxable under AS 43.55.011(e) that receives a reduction in the gross value at the point of production under AS 43.55.160(f) or (g) and that is produced during a calendar year after December 31, 2013. A tax credit authorized by this subsection may not reduce a producer's tax liability for a calendar year under AS 43.55.011(e) below zero.

(j) A producer may apply against the producer's tax liability for the calendar year under AS 43.55.011(e) a tax credit in the amount specified in this subsection for each barrel of oil taxable under AS 43.55.011(e) that does not receive a reduction in the gross value at the point of production under AS 43.55.160(f) or (g) and that is produced during a calendar year after December 31, 2013, from leases or properties north of 68 degrees North latitude. A tax credit under this subsection may not reduce a producer's tax liability for a calendar year under AS 43.55.011(e) below the amount calculated under AS 43.55.011(f). The amount of the tax credit for a barrel of taxable oil subject to this subsection produced during a month of the calendar year is

(1) $8 for each barrel of taxable oil if the average gross value at the point of production for the month is less than $80 a barrel;

(2) $7 for each barrel of taxable oil if the average gross value at the point of production for the month is greater than or equal to $80 a barrel, but less than $90 a barrel;

(3) $6 for each barrel of taxable oil if the average gross value at the point of production for the month is greater than or equal to $90 a barrel, but less than $100 a barrel;

(4) $5 for each barrel of taxable oil if the average gross value at the point of production for the month is greater than or equal to $100 a barrel, but less than $110 a barrel;

(5) $4 for each barrel of taxable oil if the average gross value at the point of production for the month is greater than or equal to $110 a barrel, but less than $120 a barrel;

(6) $3 for each barrel of taxable oil if the average gross value at the point of production for the month is greater than or equal to $120 a barrel, but less than $130 a barrel;

(7) $2 for each barrel of taxable oil if the average gross value at the point of production for the month is greater than or equal to $130 a barrel, but less than $140 a barrel;

(8) $1 for each barrel of taxable oil if the average gross value at the point of production for the month is greater than or equal to $140 a barrel, but less than $150 a barrel;

(9) zero if the average gross value at the point of production for the month is greater than or equal to $150 a barrel.

(h) A producer that purchases a production tax credit certificate may apply the credits against its production tax levied by AS 43.55.011(e). Regardless of the price the producer paid for the certificate, the producer may receive a credit against its production tax liability for the full amount of the credit, but for not more than the amount for which the certificate is issued. A production tax credit or a portion of a production tax credit or a production tax credit certificate or a portion of a production tax credit certificate allowed under this section

(1) may not be applied more than once;

(2)  may be applied in a later calendar year;

(3)  may, regardless of when the credit was earned, be applied to satisfy a tax, interest, penalty, fee, or other charge that

(3) an amount of the production tax credit in excess of the amount that may be applied for a calendar or tax year under this subsection may be carried forward and applied against the taxpayer's tax liability under AS 43.55.011(e) in one or more later calendar years or under AS 43.20 in one or more later tax years.

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, of AS 31.05, or of AS 40.25.100, the department shall provide to the Department of Natural Resources information submitted with a claim under this section to support the eligibility of an exploration expenditure, including seismic exploration data and well data, and any information described in (f)(2) of this section received by the department.

(k) Subject to the terms and conditions of this section, if a claim is filed under (f)(1) of this section before January 1, 2016, a credit against the production tax levied by AS 43.55.011(e) is allowed in an amount equal to five percent of an eligible expenditure under this subsection incurred for seismic exploration performed before July 1, 2003. To be eligible under this subsection, an expenditure must

(1) have been for seismic exploration that

(A) obtained data that the commissioner of natural resources considers to be in the best interest of the state to acquire for public distribution; and

(B) was conducted outside the boundaries of a production unit; however, the amount of the expenditure that is otherwise eligible under this section is reduced proportionately by the portion of the seismic exploration activity that crossed into a production unit; and

(2) qualify under (b)(4) of this section.

(l) The first three unaffiliated persons that drill an offshore exploration well for the purpose of discovering oil or gas in Cook Inlet that penetrates and evaluates a prospect in the pre-Tertiary zone using a jack-up rig are eligible for the credit under this subsection. The person that drills the first exploration well is entitled to a credit in the amount of 100 percent of its exploration expenditures or $25,000,000, whichever is less; the person that drills the second exploration well using the same jack-up rig is entitled to a credit in the amount of 90 percent of its exploration expenditures or $22,500,000, whichever is less; and the person that drills the third exploration well using the same jack-up rig is entitled to a credit in the amount of 80 percent of its exploration expenditures or $20,000,000, whichever is less. A person or an affiliate of a person drilling an exploration well is not entitled to a credit for more than one exploration well under this subsection. The department shall make a determination of the order in which the wells are drilled based on the date and time that the drill bit first turns to the right against the seafloor for the purpose of drilling the well. Exploration expenditures eligible for the credit in this subsection may include the necessary and reasonable costs to modify an existing jack-up rig for use in Cook Inlet, may not include the cost to construct or manufacture a jack-up rig, and, notwithstanding (b) of this section, must be incurred for work performed after March 31, 2010. If the exploration well for which a credit is received under this subsection results in sustained production of oil or gas from a reservoir discovered by the exploration well, and notwithstanding that the credit may have been transferred under (g) of this section, 50 percent of the amount of the credit received shall be repaid to the department by the person that received the credit in equal monthly installments over a 10-year period commencing 60 days after the start of sustained production of oil or gas. Whether the exploration well for which a credit is requested under this subsection penetrated and evaluated a prospect in the pre-Tertiary zone and the exploration well resulted in sustained production of oil or gas from a reservoir discovered by the exploration well shall be determined by the commissioner of natural resources and reported to the commissioner. A taxpayer that obtains a credit under this subsection may not claim a tax credit under AS 43.55.023 or another provision in this section for the same exploration expenditure. In this subsection,

(1) "jack-up rig" means a mobile drilling platform with extendible legs for support on the ocean floor;

(2) "reservoir" means an oil and gas accumulation, discovered and evaluated by testing, that is separate from any other accumulation of oil and gas;

(3) "sustained production" means production of oil or gas from a reservoir into a pipeline or other means of transportation to market, but does not include testing, evaluation, or pilot production.

(m) The persons that drill the first four exploration wells in the state and within the areas described in (o) of this section on state lands, private lands, or federal onshore lands for the purpose of discovering oil or gas that penetrate and evaluate a prospect in a basin described in (o) of this section are eligible for a credit under (a)(6) of this section. A credit under this subsection may not be taken for more than two exploration wells in a single area described in (o)(1)ยง(6) of this section. Notwithstanding (b) of this section, exploration expenditures eligible for the credit in this subsection must be incurred for work performed after June 1, 2012, and before July 1, 2017, except that expenditures to complete an exploration well that was spudded but not completed before July 1, 2017, are eligible for the credit under this subsection. A person planning to drill an exploration well on private land and to apply for a credit under this subsection shall obtain written consent from the owner of the oil and gas interest for the full public release of all well data after the expiration of the confidentiality period applicable to information collected under (f) of this section. The written consent of the owner of the oil and gas interest must be submitted to the commissioner of natural resources before approval of the proposed exploration well. In addition to the requirements in (c)(1), (c)(2)(A), and (c)(2)(C) of this section and submission of the written consent of the owner of the oil and gas interest, a person planning to drill an exploration well shall obtain approval from the commissioner of natural resources before the well is spudded. The commissioner of natural resources shall make a written determination approving or rejecting an exploration well within 60 days after receiving the request for approval or as soon as is practicable thereafter. Before approving the exploration well, the commissioner of natural resources shall consider the following: the location of the well; the proximity to a community in need of a local energy source; the proximity of existing infrastructure; the experience and safety record of the explorer in conducting operations in remote or roadless areas; the projected cost schedule; whether seismic mapping and seismic data sufficiently identify a particular trap for exploration; whether the targeted and planned depth and range are designed to penetrate and fully evaluate the hydrocarbon potential of the proposed prospect and reach the level below which economic hydrocarbon reservoirs are likely to be found, or reach 12,000 feet or more true vertical depth; and whether the exploration plan provides for a full evaluation of the wellbore below surface casing to the depth of the well. Whether the exploration well for which a credit is requested under this subsection is located within an area and a basin described under (o) of this section shall be determined by the commissioner of natural resources and reported to the commissioner. A taxpayer that obtains a credit under this subsection may not claim a tax credit under AS 43.55.023 or another provision in this section for the same exploration expenditure.

(n) The persons that conduct the first four seismic exploration projects in the state and within the areas described in (o) of this section for the purpose of discovering oil or gas in a basin are eligible for the credit under (a)(7) of this section. A credit under this subsection may not be taken for more than one seismic exploration project in a single area described in (o)(1)ยง(6) of this section. Exploration expenditures eligible for the credit in this subsection must be incurred for work performed after June 1, 2012, and before July 1, 2016. A person planning to conduct a seismic exploration project on private land and to apply for a credit under this subsection shall obtain written consent from the owner of the oil and gas interest for the full public release of all geophysical data and compliance with the data submission requirements in (f)(2) of this section. Notwithstanding (f)(2)(C)(ii) of this section, to qualify for a credit under this subsection, a person shall submit the written consent of the owner of the oil and gas interest for the release of data if applicable, and all data required under (f)(2) of this section to the Department of Natural Resources and shall agree in writing that all seismic data requirements submitted under the requirements of (f)(2) of this section may be made public two years after receiving a credit under this subsection. A person intending to qualify for the tax credit under this subsection shall obtain approval from the commissioner of natural resources before the commencement of the seismic exploration activities. The commissioner of natural resources shall make a written determination approving or rejecting a seismic project within 60 days after receiving the request for approval or as soon as is practicable thereafter. Before approving a seismic exploration project, the commissioner shall consider the following: the location of the project; the projected cost schedule; the data acquisition and data processing plan; the reasons for choosing the particular area for seismic exploration; and the experience and safety record of the person in conducting seismic exploration operations in remote or roadless areas. Whether the seismic exploration project for which a credit is requested under this subsection is located in a basin described in (o) of this section shall be determined by the commissioner of natural resources and reported to the commissioner. A taxpayer that obtains a credit under this subsection may not claim a tax credit under AS 43.55.023 or another provision in this section for the same exploration expenditure.

(o) The activity that is the basis for a credit claimed under (a)(6) and (m) of this section or (a)(7) and (n) of this section must be for the exploration of a basin and within the following areas whose central points are determined using the World Geographic System of 1984 datum,

(1) 100 miles from 66.896128 degrees North, -162.598187 degrees West;

(2) 150 miles from 64.839474 degrees North, -147.72094 degrees West;

(6) 100 miles from 56.005988 degrees North, -160.56083 degrees West.

(p) In this section,

(1) "Cook Inlet prospect" means a location within the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin, as that term is defined by regulation adopted to implement AS 38.05.180(f)(4);

(2) "preexisting well" means a well that was spudded more than 540 days but less than 35 years before the date on which the exploration well to which it is compared is spudded.

(q) On the day on which an application for a tax credit certificate is submitted under (f) of this section, the department shall issue to the explorer a conditional tax credit certificate. For the purposes of AS 43.55.028(e), the department may, at the time of an application under AS 43.55.028(e), accept from an explorer a conditional tax credit certificate issued under this subsection; however, the department may not purchase a conditional tax credit certificate. A conditional tax credit certificate under this subsection

(1) may be used to apply for the purchase of a tax credit certificate under AS 43.55.028(e) if the conditional tax credit certificate is for exploration expenditures incurred before July 1, 2017;

(2) may not be sold, transferred, or conveyed;

(3) has no value; and

(4) expires on the day on which the department issues a transferable tax credit certificate under (f) of this section.

###### Sec. 43.55.028.   Oil and gas tax credit fund established; cash purchases of tax credit certificates.

(a) The oil and gas tax credit fund is established as a separate fund of the state. The purpose of the fund is to purchase transferable tax credit certificates issued under  AS 43.55.023 and production tax credit certificates issued under  AS 43.55.025 and to pay refunds and payments claimed under  AS 43.20.046,  43.20.047, or  43.20.053. The oil and gas tax credit fund established under this subsection may not be used to purchase a tax credit certificate for a credit earned under this chapter for activity occurring on or after July 1, 2017.

(b) The oil and gas tax credit fund consists of

(1) money appropriated to the fund, including any appropriation of the percentage provided under (c) of this section of all revenue from taxes levied by  AS 43.55.011 that is not required to be deposited in the constitutional budget reserve fund established in art. IX, sec. 17(a), Constitution of the State of Alaska,  less the amount described in (r) of this section; and

(2) earnings on the fund.

(c) The applicable percentage for a fiscal year under (b)(1) of this section is determined with reference to the average price or value forecast by the department for Alaska North Slope oil sold or otherwise disposed of on the United States West Coast during the fiscal year for which the appropriation of revenue from taxes levied by  AS 43.55.011 is made. If that forecast is

(1) $60 a barrel or higher, the applicable percentage is 10 percent;

(2) less than $60 a barrel, the applicable percentage is 15 percent.

(d) The department shall manage the fund.

(e) The department, on the written application of a person to whom a transferable tax credit certificate has been issued under  AS 43.55.023(d) or former AS 43.55.023(m) for an expenditure incurred before July 1, 2017, or to whom a production tax credit certificate has been issued under  AS 43.55.025(f) for an expenditure incurred before July 1, 2017, may use  either available money in the oil and gas tax credit fund  or, subject to appropriation by the  legislature, money disbursed to the commissioner, or both, to purchase, in whole or in part, the certificate. The department may not purchase  with money from the oil and gas tax credit fund a total of more than $70,000,000 in tax credit certificates from a person in a calendar year.  The total amount of purchases made by the department with money from the oil and gas tax credit fund from a person in a year may not exceed the assumed payment amount for each year, as calculated under (l) of this section without the discount provided in (m) of this section. Before purchasing a certificate or part of a certificate, the department shall find that

(1) the calendar year of the purchase is not earlier than the first calendar year for which the credit shown on the certificate would otherwise be allowed to be applied against a tax;

(2) the application is not the result of the division of a single entity into multiple entities that would reasonably be expected to apply as a single entity if the $70,000,000 limitation in this subsection did not exist;

(3) the applicant's total tax liability under  AS 43.55.011(e), after application of all available tax credits, for the calendar year in which the application is made is zero;

(4) the applicant's average daily production of oil and gas taxable under  AS 43.55.011(e) during the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the application is made was not more than 50,000 BTU equivalent barrels; and

(5) the purchase is consistent with this section and regulations adopted under this section.

(f) Money in the fund remaining at the end of a fiscal year does not lapse and remains available for expenditure in successive fiscal years.

(g) The department shall adopt regulations to carry out the purposes of this section, including standards and procedures to allocate available money among applications for purchases under this chapter and claims for refunds and payments under  AS 43.20.046,  43.20.047, or  43.20.053 when the total amount of the applications for purchase and claims for refund exceed the amount of available money in the fund. The regulations adopted by the department

(1) may not, when allocating available money in the fund under this section, distinguish an application for the purchase of a credit certificate issued under former AS 43.55.023(m) or a claim for a refund or payment under  AS 43.20.046,  43.20.047, or  43.20.053;

(2) must, when allocating available money in the fund under this section, grant a preference, between two applicants, to the applicant with a higher percentage of resident workers in the applicant's workforce, including workers employed by the applicant's direct contractors, in the state in the previous calendar year; in this paragraph, "resident worker" has the meaning given in  AS 43.40.092(b);

(3) must,  for a purchase from money in the  fund, provide for the purchase of the amount equal to the first 50 percent of the credit repurchase limit for each person under (e) of this section at a rate of 100 percent of the value of the certificate or portion of the certificate requested to be purchased and the amount equal to the next 50 percent of the credit repurchase limit for each person under (e) of this section at a rate of 75 percent of the value of the certificate or portion of the certificate requested to be purchased.

(h) Nothing in this section creates a dedicated fund.

(i) In this section,

(1)  "money disbursed to the commissioner"  means money disbursed to the commissioner from the Alaska Tax Credit Certificate Bond Corporation reserve fund established in AS 37.18.040;

(2) "qualified capital expenditure" has the meaning given in  AS 43.55.023;

(3)  "true interest cost" means the true interest  cost of the bonds anticipated to be issued under AS 37.18.

(j) If an applicant or claimant has an outstanding liability to the state directly related to the applicant's or claimant's oil or gas exploration, development, or production and the department has not previously reduced the amount paid to that applicant or claimant for a certificate or refund because of that outstanding liability, the department may purchase only that portion of a certificate or pay only that portion of a refund that exceeds the outstanding liability,  regardless of whether the purchase is made with money from the  fund or money disbursed to the commissioner. After notifying the applicant or claimant, the department may apply the amount by which the department reduced its purchase of a certificate or payment for a refund because of an outstanding liability to satisfy the outstanding liability. Satisfaction of an outstanding liability under this subsection does not affect the applicant's ability to contest that liability.  The department may enter into contracts or agreements with another department to which the outstanding liability is owed. In this subsection, "outstanding liability" means an amount of tax, interest, penalty, fee, rental, royalty, or other charge for which the state has issued a demand for payment that has not been paid when due and, if contested, has not been finally resolved against the state.

(k) The department may negotiate a purchase, refund, or payment under this section to be made from money disbursed to the commissioner. Before making a purchase, refund, or payment, the department shall calculate the maximum amount for a purchase, refund, or payment under (  l) of this section. An applicant or claimant that has requested a purchase, refund, or payment by the department from the fund shall provide a notice of interest to the department by the date determined by the commissioner if the applicant or claimant is interested in a purchase, refund, or payment from money disbursed to the commissioner instead. An applicant or claimant that requests a purchase, refund, or payment from the fund on or after July 1, 2018, shall include any notice of interest in a purchase, refund, or payment from money disbursed to the commissioner at the same time that the applicant or claimant requests a purchase, refund, or payment by the department from the fund. The department may not use money disbursed to the commissioner for a purchase, refund, or payment under this section if the applicant or claimant fails to provide the department with a notice of interest in a purchase, refund, or payment from money disbursed to the commissioner. A notice of interest for a purchase, refund, or payment from money disbursed to the commissioner must include all of the requests for purchases, refunds, or payments made by the applicant or claimant and, if applicable, a statement indicating whether the applicant intends to meet a condition in (m)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. An applicant or claimant may not include in a notice of interest a request for purchase, refund, or payment from the fund if the request could have been included in a previous notice of interest under this subsection. The department shall make an offer of purchase, refund, or payment with money disbursed to the commissioner to an applicant or claimant that provides the department with a timely notice of interest. The department shall make an offer of purchase, refund, or payment from money disbursed to the commissioner at a time based on the anticipated schedule for disbursement of money to the commissioner. The applicant or claimant shall notify the department of acceptance of the offer of purchase, refund, or payment within 10 days after the offer is made. An offer of purchase, refund, or payment must be conditioned on the disbursement of money to the commissioner. A transferable tax credit certificate issued under  AS 43.55.023, production tax credit certificate issued under  AS 43.55.025, or claim for a refund or payment under  AS 43.20.046,  43.20.047, or  43.20.053 is not eligible for purchase by the department with money disbursed to the commissioner if the applicant or claimant

(1) fails to provide the department with a notice of interest of an offer of purchase, refund, or payment from money disbursed to the commissioner by the date determined by the commissioner under this subsection; or

(2) declines an offer of purchase, refund, or payment by the department with money disbursed to the commissioner for that transferable tax credit certificate, production tax credit certificate, or refund or claim for payment.

(l) The department shall calculate the maximum amount for a purchase, refund, or payment with money disbursed to the commissioner. The maximum amount for a purchase, refund, or payment is the sum of the assumed payment amounts for purchases, refunds, and payments for each year discounted as provided in (m) of this section. The assumed payment amount for each year is the assumed appropriations to the fund multiplied by the assumed proration amount calculated in this subsection. The assumed appropriation to the fund each year is an amount equal to the percentage provided under (c) of this section of the total taxes levied by  AS 43.55.011 as forecast by the department before the application of tax credits. The assumed proration amount is that proportion of payments the department would have allocated from the fund, if money had not been disbursed to the commissioner, based on the date of the request for purchase, refund, or payment from the fund. When determining the assumed proration amount under this subsection, the department shall

(1) allocate requests received in the same year together;

(2) prioritize requests for payments from the earliest to the latest year; and

(3) assume that no purchases are made with money disbursed to the commissioner.

(m) For purposes of the calculation in (  l) of this section, the department shall discount the assumed payment amount each year after the first year by a discount rate. Unless another discount rate in this subsection applies, a discount rate of 10 percent applies to the assumed payment amount for a request for purchase of a transferable tax credit certificate issued under  AS 43.55.023 or a production tax credit certificate issued under  AS 43.55.025. An applicant's agreement to a discount rate under (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection is only consideration for the amount that the purchase exceeds the amount that would have been purchased in the absence of the agreement. For a refund or claim for payment under  AS 43.20.046,  43.20.047, or  43.20.053, the discount rate is the true interest cost plus 1.5 percent, but may not exceed 10 percent. For a purchase of a transferable tax credit certificate issued under  AS 43.55.023 or a production tax credit certificate issued under  AS 43.55.025, the discount rate is the true interest cost plus 1.5 percent, but may not exceed 10 percent, in total,

(1) for either a transferable tax credit certificate issued under  AS 43.55.023 for which the applicant submitted data required under  AS 43.55.025(f)(2) or a production tax credit certificate issued under  AS 43.55.025, if the applicant agrees as a condition of the purchase that the 10-year confidentiality period under  AS 43.55.025(f)(2)(C)(ii) that would otherwise apply to the seismic data or other geophysical data is waived by the applicant;

(2) if the applicant, or an entity related to the applicant with the applicant's consent, and the Department of Natural Resources agree to an overriding royalty interest agreement under  AS 44.37.230; or

(3) if the applicant commits to incur, not later than 24 months after the purchase of the certificate, qualified capital expenditures in an amount greater than or equal to the purchase amount, and

(A) the applicant provides to the department evidence of the commitment and a plan to

(i) use the qualified capital expenditures for the purpose of increasing production of oil or gas from leases or properties in the state; and

(ii) maximize the hiring of state residents and use of state businesses related to qualified capital expenditures;

(B) the applicant agrees in writing that, if the applicant does not incur qualified capital expenditures in an amount greater than or equal to the purchase amount within 24 months after the purchase of the certificate, the applicant shall pay the department the lesser of the difference between the purchase amount and the

(i) amount the applicant would have been paid had this subsection not applied; or

(ii) actual amount of qualified capital expenditures incurred by the applicant in the 24-month period; and

(C) after reviewing documents submitted under (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the commissioner approves the reduced discount rate for the purchase.

(n) An agreement under (m)(3)(B) of this section may require the applicant to pay the department interest on the amount due under (m)(3)(B) of this section. The interest rate must be consistent with the interest rate provided for a delinquent tax under  AS 43.05.225. Payment under (m)(3)(B) of this section and interest under this subsection is waived if the department determines that the applicant could not incur the qualified capital expenditures because of a natural disaster, injunction or other court order, or administrative order.

(o) An applicant or claimant may not use a transferable tax credit certificate issued under  AS 43.55.023, production tax credit certificate issued under  AS 43.55.025, or refund or claim for payment under  AS 43.20.046,  43.20.047, or  43.20.053 purchased by the department with money disbursed to the commissioner against tax liability, even if the purchase, refund, or payment amount was less than the total amount requested for purchase, refund, or payment.

(p) The department shall provide to the Department of Natural Resources the information necessary to evaluate an overriding royalty interest for the purposes of  AS 44.37.230.

(q) After bonds are first issued by the Alaska Tax Credit Certificate Bond Corporation established under  AS 37.18.010, the legislature may determine the amount of an appropriation under (b)(1) of this section by multiplying the percentage under (c) of this section by the net revenue from taxes levied by  AS 43.55.011.

(r) The legislature may reduce an appropriation made under (b)(1) of this section by an amount equal to the amount appropriated to the Alaska Tax Credit Certificate Bond Corporation for maintenance of the required debt service reserve in the Alaska Tax Credit Certificate Bond Corporation reserve fund, as calculated under  AS 37.18.040(g).

(s) The legislature may, for purposes of making purchases, refunds, and payments under this section, appropriate an amount equal to the amount disbursed to the commissioner by the Alaska Tax Credit Certificate Bond Corporation for purchases, refunds, and payments under this section.

###### Sec. 43.55.029.   Assignment of tax credit certificate.

(a) An explorer or producer that has applied for a production tax credit under AS 43.55.023(a) or (l) or 43.55.025(a) may make a present assignment of the production tax credit certificate expected to be issued by the department to a third-party assignee. The assignment may be made either at the time the application is filed with the department or not later than 30 days after the date of filing with the department. Once a notice of assignment in compliance with this section is filed with the department, the assignment is irrevocable and cannot be modified by the explorer or producer without the written consent of the assignee named in the assignment. If a production tax credit certificate is issued to the explorer or producer, the notice of assignment remains effective and shall be filed with the department by the explorer or producer together with any application for the department to purchase the certificate under AS 43.55.028(e).

(b) To be effective, the assignment does not require the approval or consent of the department. The assignment must, at a minimum,

(1) be made in writing and signed by an officer or legally qualified agent of the explorer or producer making the assignment and the assignee, respectively;

(2) identify the explorer or producer making the assignment, the assignee in whose favor the assignment is being made, and the production tax credit application that is the subject of the assignment;

(3) define the interest in the production tax credit being assigned, expressed as either an amount in dollars, which may not exceed 90 percent of the credit applied for, or a percentage of the credit to be issued by the department;

(4) specify an account with a bank located in the state, with sufficient information for the electronic transfer of funds, to receive any future proceeds from the purchase of the tax credit certificate under AS 43.55.028(e);

(5) cite this section and acknowledge that, once filed with the department, the assignment is irrevocable and cannot be modified without the written consent of the assignee.

(c) An assignment complying with this section creates a property interest owned by the assignee in the application and any production tax credit certificates issued by the department to the explorer or producer and any future proceeds resulting from the application, in the amount or to the extent set out in the assignment. An assignee may create a valid and enforceable security interest in that property as otherwise provided by law.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and to the maximum extent permitted under federal laws, an assignment complying with this section shall give the assignee a first priority claim, not dischargeable in bankruptcy, against the proceeds received by the explorer or producer, including its estate, trustee, or other representative, resulting from the production tax credit application that is the subject of the assignment under this section, if the assignee has taken the steps necessary under state and federal law to perfect a security interest in the assignment.

(e) Nothing in this section affects the terms and conditions otherwise required for an explorer or producer to qualify for a production tax credit or the determination by the department of the amount of credit the explorer or producer is qualified to receive.

(f) Neither the state nor the department, or any other agency, officer, or employee of the state, shall be subject to suit or any claim arising out of or in connection with an assignment made under this section, whether by act or omission.

(g) The department may adopt regulations to carry out the purposes of this section.

###### Sec. 43.55.030.   Filing of statements.

###### Sec. 43.55.140.   [Renumbered as AS 43.55.900.]

###### Sec. 43.55.150.   Determination of gross value at the point of production.

(a) For the purposes of AS 43.55.011ยง43.55.180, the gross value at the point of production is calculated using the actual costs of transportation of the oil or gas, except when the

(1) shipper of oil or gas is affiliated with the transportation carrier or with a person that owns an interest in the transportation facility;

(2) contract for the transportation of oil or gas is not an arm's length transaction; or

(3) method or terms of transportation of oil or gas are not reasonable in view of existing alternative transportation options.

(b) If the department finds that a condition in (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section is present, the gross value at the point of production is calculated using the actual costs of transportation, or the reasonable costs of transportation as determined under this subsection, whichever is lower. The department shall determine the reasonable costs of transportation, using the fair market value of like transportation, the fair market value of equally efficient and available alternative modes of transportation, or other reasonable methods. Transportation costs fixed by tariff rates that have been adjudicated as just and reasonable by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska or another regulatory agency and transportation costs in an arm's length transaction paid by parties not affiliated with an owner of the method of transportation shall be considered prima facie reasonable.

(c) In determining the gross value of oil under this section, the department may not allow as reasonable costs of transportation

(1) the amount of loss of or damage to, or of expense incurred due to the loss of or damage to, a vessel used to transport oil if the loss, damage, or expense is incurred in connection with a catastrophic oil discharge from the vessel into the marine or inland waters of the state;

(2) the incremental costs of transportation of the oil that are attributable to temporary use of or chartered or substituted service provided by another vessel due to the loss of or damage to a vessel regularly used to transport oil and that are incurred in connection with a catastrophic oil discharge into the marine or inland waters of the state; and

(3) the costs incurred to charter, contract, or hire vessels and equipment used to contain or clean up a catastrophic oil discharge.

(a) For oil and gas produced before January 1, 2022, except as provided in (b), (f), and (g) of this section, for the purposes of

(1) AS 43.55.011(e)(1) and (2), the annual production tax value of taxable oil, gas, or oil and gas produced during a calendar year in a category for which a separate annual production tax value is required to be calculated under this paragraph is the gross value at the point of production of that oil, gas, or oil and gas taxable under AS 43.55.011(e), less the producer's lease expenditures under AS 43.55.165 for the calendar year applicable to the oil, gas, or oil and gas in that category produced by the producer during the calendar year, as adjusted under AS 43.55.170; a separate annual production tax value shall be calculated for

(A) oil and gas produced from leases or properties in the state that include land north of 68 degrees North latitude, other than gas produced before 2022 and used in the state;

(B) oil and gas produced from leases or properties in the state outside the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin, no part of which is north of 68 degrees North latitude and that qualifies for a tax credit under AS 43.55.024(a) and (b); this subparagraph does not apply to

(i) gas produced before 2022 and used in the state; or

(ii) oil and gas subject to AS 43.55.011(p);

(D) gas produced during a month from a lease or property in the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin is the gross value at the point of production of the gas taxable under AS 43.55.011(e) and produced by the producer from that lease or property, less 1/12 of the producer's lease expenditures under AS 43.55.165 for the calendar year applicable to the gas produced by the producer from that lease or property, as adjusted under AS 43.55.170;

(E) gas produced during a month from a lease or property outside the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin and used in the state is the gross value at the point of production of that gas taxable under AS 43.55.011(e) and produced by the producer from that lease or property, less 1/12 of the producer's lease expenditures under AS 43.55.165 for the calendar year applicable to that gas produced by the producer from that lease or property, as adjusted under AS 43.55.170.

(b) A production tax value calculated under this section may not be less than zero.

(c) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of AS 43.55.150, for purposes of calculating a monthly production tax value under (a)(2) of this section, the gross value at the point of production of the oil and gas is calculated under regulations adopted by the department that provide for using an appropriate monthly share of the producer's costs of transportation for the calendar year.

(d) Irrespective of whether a producer produces taxable oil or gas during a calendar year or month, the producer is considered to have generated a positive production tax value if a calculation described in (a) of this section yields a positive number because the producer's adjusted lease expenditures for a calendar year under AS 43.55.165 and 43.55.170 are less than zero as a result of the producer's receiving a payment or credit under AS 43.55.170. An explorer that has obtained a transferable tax credit certificate under AS 43.55.023(d) for the amount of a tax credit under former AS 43.55.023(b) is considered a producer, subject to the tax levied by AS 43.55.011(e), to the extent that the explorer generates a positive production tax value as the result of the explorer's receiving a payment or credit under AS 43.55.170.

(e) Any adjusted lease expenditures under AS 43.55.165 and 43.55.170 incurred to explore for, develop, or produce oil or gas from a lease or property outside the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin that would otherwise be deductible by a producer in a calendar year but whose deduction would cause an annual production tax value calculated under (a)(1) or (h) of this section of taxable oil or gas produced during the calendar year to be less than zero may be used to establish a carried- forward annual loss under AS 43.55.165(a)(3). A reduction under (f) or (g) of this section must be added back to the calculation of production tax values for that calendar year before the determination of a carried-forward annual loss under this subsection. However, the department shall provide by regulation a method to ensure that, for a period for which a producer's tax liability is limited by AS 43.55.011(o) or (p), any adjusted lease expenditures under AS 43.55.165 and 43.55.170 that would otherwise be deductible by a producer for that period but whose deduction would cause a production tax value calculated under (a)(1)(E) or (F) or (h)(3) of this section to be less than zero are accounted for as though the adjusted lease expenditures had first been used as deductions in calculating the production tax values of oil or gas subject to any of the limitations under AS 43.55.011(o) or (p) that have positive production tax values so as to reduce the tax liability calculated without regard to the limitation to the maximum amount provided for under the applicable provision of AS 43.55.011(o) or (p). Only the amount of those adjusted lease expenditures remaining after the accounting provided for under this subsection may be used to establish a carried-forward annual loss under AS 43.55.165(a)(3). In this subsection, "producer" includes "explorer."

(f) On and after January 1, 2014, in the calculation of an annual production tax value of a producer under (a)(1)(A) or (h)(1) of this section, the gross value at the point of production of oil or gas produced from a lease or property north of 68 degrees North latitude meeting one or more of the following criteria is reduced by 20 percent: (1) the oil or gas is produced from a lease or property that does not contain a lease that was within a unit on January 1, 2003; (2) the oil or gas is produced from a participating area established after December 31, 2011, that is within a unit formed under AS 38.05.180(p) before January 1, 2003, if the participating area does not contain a reservoir that had previously been in a participating area established before December 31, 2011; (3) the oil or gas is produced from acreage that was added to an existing participating area by the Department of Natural Resources on and after January 1, 2014, and the producer demonstrates to the department that the volume of oil or gas produced is from acreage added to an existing participating area. This subsection does not apply to gas produced before 2022 that is used in the state or to gas produced on and after January 1, 2022. For oil and gas first produced from a lease or property after December 31, 2016, a reduction allowed under this subsection applies from the date of commencement of regular production of oil and gas from that lease or property and expires after three years, consecutive or nonconsecutive, in which the average annual price per barrel for Alaska North Slope crude oil for sale on the United States West Coast is more than $70 or after seven years, whichever occurs first. For oil and gas first produced from a lease or property before January 1, 2017, a reduction allowed under this subsection expires on the earlier of January 1, 2023, or January 1 following three years, consecutive or nonconsecutive, in which the average annual price per barrel for Alaska North Slope crude oil for sale on the United States West Coast is more than $70. The Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission shall determine the commencement of regular production of oil and gas for purposes of this subsection. A reduction under this subsection may not reduce the gross value at the point of production below zero. In this subsection, "participating area" means a reservoir or portion of a reservoir producing or contributing to production as approved by the Department of Natural Resources.

(g) On and after January 1, 2014, in addition to the reduction under (f) of this section, in the calculation of an annual production tax value of a producer under (a)(1)(A) or (h)(1) of this section, the gross value at the point of production of oil or gas produced from a lease or property north of 68 degrees North latitude that does not contain a lease that was within a unit on January 1, 2003, is reduced by 10 percent if the oil or gas is produced from a unit made up solely of leases that have a royalty share of more than 12.5 percent in amount or value of the production removed or sold from the lease as determined under AS 38.05.180(f). This subsection does not apply if the royalty obligation for one or more of the leases in the unit has been reduced to 12.5 percent or less under AS 38.05.180(j) for all or part of the calendar year for which the annual production tax value is calculated. This subsection does not apply to gas produced before 2022 that is used in the state or to gas produced on and after January 1, 2022. For oil and gas first produced from a lease or property after December 31, 2016, a reduction allowed under this subsection applies from the date of commencement of regular production of oil and gas from that lease or property and expires after three years, consecutive or nonconsecutive, in which the average annual price per barrel for Alaska North Slope crude oil for sale on the United States West Coast is more than $70 or after seven years, whichever occurs first. For oil and gas first produced from a lease or property before January 1, 2017, a reduction allowed under this subsection expires on the earlier of January 1, 2023, or January 1 following three years, consecutive or nonconsecutive, in which the average annual price per barrel for Alaska North Slope crude oil for sale on the United States West Coast is more than $70. The Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission shall determine the commencement of regular production for purposes of this subsection. A reduction under this subsection may not reduce the gross value at the point of production below zero.

(h) For oil produced on and after January 1, 2022, except as provided in (b), (f), and (g) of this section, for the purposes of AS 43.55.011(e)(3), the annual production tax value of oil taxable under AS 43.55.011(e) produced by a producer during a calendar year

(1) from leases or properties in the state that include land north of 68 degrees North latitude is the gross value at the point of production of that oil, less the producer's lease expenditures under AS 43.55.165 for the calendar year incurred to explore for, develop, or produce oil and gas deposits located in the state north of 68 degrees North latitude or located in leases or properties in the state that include land north of 68 degrees North latitude, as adjusted under AS 43.55.170;

(2) before or during the last calendar year under AS 43.55.024(b) for which the producer could take a tax credit under AS 43.55.024(a), from leases or properties in the state outside the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin, no part of which is north of 68 degrees North latitude, other than leases or properties subject to AS 43.55.011(p), is the gross value at the point of production of that oil, less the producer's lease expenditures under AS 43.55.165 for the calendar year incurred to explore for, develop, or produce oil and gas deposits located in the state outside the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin and south of 68 degrees North latitude, other than oil and gas deposits located in a lease or property that includes land north of 68 degrees North latitude or that is subject to AS 43.55.011(p) or, before January 1, 2027, from which commercial production has not begun, as adjusted under AS 43.55.170;

(3) from leases or properties subject to AS 43.55.011(p) is the gross value at the point of production of that oil, less the producer's lease expenditures under AS 43.55.165 for the calendar year incurred to explore for, develop, or produce oil and gas deposits located in leases or properties subject to AS 43.55.011(p) or, before January 1, 2027, located in leases or properties in the state outside the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin, no part of which is north of 68 degrees North latitude from which commercial production has not begun, as adjusted under AS 43.55.170;

(4) from leases or properties in the state no part of which is north of 68 degrees North latitude, other than leases or properties subject to (2) or (3) of this subsection, is the gross value at the point of production of that oil less the producer's lease expenditures under AS 43.55.165 for the calendar year incurred to explore for, develop, or produce oil and gas deposits located in the state south of 68 degrees North latitude, other than oil and gas deposits located in a lease or property in the state that includes land north of 68 degrees North latitude, and excluding lease expenditures that are deductible under (2) or (3) of this subsection or would be deductible under (2) or (3) of this subsection if not prohibited by (b) of this section, as adjusted under AS 43.55.170; a separate annual production tax value shall be calculated for

(A)  oil produced from each lease or property in the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin;

(B)  oil produced from each lease or property outside the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin, no part of which is north of 68 degrees North latitude, other than leases or properties subject to (3) of this subsection.

###### Sec. 43.55.165.   Lease expenditures.

(a) For purposes of this chapter, a producer's lease expenditures for a calendar year are

(1) costs, other than items listed in (e) of this section, that are

(A) incurred by the producer during the calendar year after March 31, 2006, to explore for, develop, or produce oil or gas deposits located within the producer's leases or properties in the state or, in the case of land in which the producer does not own an operating right, operating interest, or working interest, to explore for oil or gas deposits within other land in the state; and

(B) allowed by the department by regulation, based on the department's determination that the costs satisfy the following three requirements:

(i) the costs must be incurred upstream of the point of production of oil and gas;

(ii) the costs must be ordinary and necessary costs of exploring for, developing, or producing, as applicable, oil or gas deposits; and

(iii) the costs must be direct costs of exploring for, developing, or producing, as applicable, oil or gas deposits;

(2) a reasonable allowance for that calendar year, as determined under regulations adopted by the department, for overhead expenses that are directly related to exploring for, developing, or producing, as applicable, the oil or gas deposits; and

(3)  lease expenditures incurred in a previous calendar year, subject to (l)ยง(r) of this section, that

(A)  met the requirements of AS 43.55.160(e) in the year in which the lease expenditures were incurred;

(B)  have not been deducted in the determination of the production tax value of oil and gas under AS 43.55.160(a) or (h) in a previous calendar year;

(C)  were not the basis of a credit under this title; and

(D)  were incurred to explore for, develop, or produce an oil or gas deposit located in the state outside the Cook Inlet sedimentary basin.

(b) For purposes of (a) of this section,

(1) direct costs include

(A) an expenditure, when incurred, to acquire an item if the acquisition cost is otherwise a direct cost, notwithstanding that the expenditure may be required to be capitalized rather than treated as an expense for financial accounting or federal income tax purposes;

(B) payments of or in lieu of property taxes, sales and use taxes, motor fuel taxes, and excise taxes;

(2) an activity does not need to be physically located on, near, or within the premises of the lease or property within which an oil or gas deposit being explored for, developed, or produced is located in order for the cost of the activity to be a cost upstream of the point of production of the oil or gas;

(3) in determining whether costs are lease expenditures, the department may consider, among other factors, the

(A) typical industry practices and standards in the state that determine the costs, other than items listed in (e) of this section, that an operator is allowed to bill a producer that is not the operator, under unit operating agreements or similar operating agreements that were in effect before December 2, 2005, and were subject to negotiation with at least one producer with substantial bargaining power, other than the operator; and

(B) standards adopted by the Department of Natural Resources that determine the costs, other than items listed in (e) of this section, that a lessee is allowed to deduct from revenue in calculating net profits under a lease issued under AS 38.05.180(f)(3)(B), (D), or (E).

(c) [Repealed,ยง66 ch 1 SSSLA 2007.]

(d) [Repealed,ยง66 ch 1 SSSLA 2007.]

(e) For purposes of this section, lease expenditures do not include

(1) depreciation, depletion, or amortization;

(2) oil or gas royalty payments, production payments, lease profit shares, or other payments or distributions of a share of oil or gas production, profit, or revenue, except that a producer's lease expenditures applicable to oil and gas produced from a lease issued under AS 38.05.180(f)(3)(B), (D), or (E) include the share of net profit paid to the state under that lease;

(3) taxes based on or measured by net income;

(4) interest or other financing charges or costs of raising equity or debt capital;

(5) acquisition costs for a lease or property or exploration license;

(6) costs arising from fraud, wilful misconduct, gross negligence, violation of law, or failure to comply with an obligation under a lease, permit, or license issued by the state or federal government;

(7) fines or penalties imposed by law;

(8) costs of arbitration, litigation, or other dispute resolution activities that involve the state or concern the rights or obligations among owners of interests in, or rights to production from, one or more leases or properties or a unit;

(9) costs incurred in organizing a partnership, joint venture, or other business entity or arrangement;

(10) amounts paid to indemnify the state; the exclusion provided by this paragraph does not apply to the costs of obtaining insurance or a surety bond from a third-party insurer or surety;

(11) surcharges levied under AS 43.55.201 or 43.55.300;

(12) an expenditure otherwise deductible under (b) of this section that is a result of an internal transfer, a transaction with an affiliate, or a transaction between related parties, or is otherwise not an arm's length transaction, unless the producer establishes to the satisfaction of the department that the amount of the expenditure does not exceed the fair market value of the expenditure;

(13) an expenditure incurred to purchase an interest in any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business trust, or any other business entity, whether or not the transaction is treated as an asset sale for federal income tax purposes;

(14) a tax levied under AS 43.55.011 or 43.55.014;

(15) costs incurred for dismantlement, removal, surrender, or abandonment of a facility, pipeline, well pad, platform, or other structure, or for the restoration of a lease, field, unit, area, tract of land, body of water, or right-of-way in conjunction with dismantlement, removal, surrender, or abandonment; a cost is not excluded under this paragraph if the dismantlement, removal, surrender, or abandonment for which the cost is incurred is undertaken for the purpose of replacing, renovating, or improving the facility, pipeline, well pad, platform, or other structure;

(16) costs incurred for containment, control, cleanup, or removal in connection with any unpermitted release of oil or a hazardous substance and any liability for damages imposed on the producer or explorer for that unpermitted release; this paragraph does not apply to the cost of developing and maintaining an oil discharge prevention and contingency plan under AS 46.04.030;

(17) costs incurred to satisfy a work commitment under an exploration license under AS 38.05.132;

(18) that portion of expenditures, that would otherwise be qualified capital expenditures, as defined in AS 43.55.023, incurred during a calendar year that are less than the product of $0.30 multiplied by the total taxable production from each lease or property, in BTU equivalent barrels, during that calendar year, except that, when a portion of a calendar year is subject to this provision, the expenditures and volumes shall be prorated within that calendar year;

(19) costs incurred for repair, replacement, or deferred maintenance of a facility, a pipeline, a structure, or equipment, other than a well, that results in or is undertaken in response to a failure, problem, or event that results in an unscheduled interruption of, or reduction in the rate of, oil or gas production; or costs incurred for repair, replacement, or deferred maintenance of a facility, a pipeline, a structure, or equipment, other than a well, that is undertaken in response to, or is otherwise associated with, an unpermitted release of a hazardous substance or of gas; however, costs under this paragraph that would otherwise constitute lease expenditures under (a) and (b) of this section may be treated as lease expenditures if the department determines that the repair or replacement is solely necessitated by an act of war, by an unanticipated grave natural disaster or other natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable, and irresistible character, the effects of which could not have been prevented or avoided by the exercise of due care or foresight, or by an intentional or negligent act or omission of a third party, other than a party or its agents in privity of contract with, or employed by, the producer or an operator acting for the producer, but only if the producer or operator, as applicable, exercised due care in operating and maintaining the facility, pipeline, structure, or equipment, and took reasonable precautions against the act or omission of the third party and against the consequences of the act or omission; in this paragraph,

(A) "costs incurred for repair, replacement, or deferred maintenance of a facility, a pipeline, a structure, or equipment" includes costs to dismantle and remove the facility, pipeline, structure, or equipment that is being replaced;

(B) "hazardous substance" has the meaning given in AS 46.03.826;

(C) "replacement" includes renovation or improvement;

(20) costs incurred to construct, acquire, or operate a refinery or crude oil topping plant, regardless of whether the products of the refinery or topping plant are used in oil or gas exploration, development, or production operations; however, if a producer owns a refinery or crude oil topping plant that is located on or near the premises of the producer's lease or property in the state and that processes the producer's oil produced from that lease or property into a product that the producer uses in the operation of the lease or property in drilling for or producing oil or gas, the producer's lease expenditures include the amount calculated by subtracting from the fair market value of the product used the prevailing value, as determined under AS 43.55.020(f), of the oil that is processed;

(21) costs of lobbying, public relations, public relations advertising, or policy advocacy.

(f) For purposes of AS 43.55.023(a) and only as to expenditures incurred to explore for an oil or gas deposit located within land in which an explorer does not own a working interest, the term "producer" in this section includes "explorer."

(g) The department shall specify or approve a reasonable allocation method for determining the portion of a cost that is appropriately treated as a lease expenditure under this section if a cost that would otherwise constitute a lease expenditure under this section is incurred to explore for, develop, or produce

(1) both an oil or gas deposit located within land outside the state and an oil or gas deposit located within a lease or property, or other land, in the state; or

(2) an oil or gas deposit located partly within land outside the state and partly within a lease or property, or other land, in the state.

(h) The department shall adopt regulations that provide for reasonable methods of allocating costs between oil and gas, between gas subject to AS 43.55.011(o) and other gas, and between leases or properties in those circumstances where an allocation of costs is required to determine lease expenditures that are costs of exploring for, developing, or producing oil deposits or costs of exploring for, developing, or producing gas deposits, or that are costs of exploring for, developing, or producing oil or gas deposits located within different leases or properties.

(i) The department may adopt regulations that establish additional standards necessary to carrying out the purposes of this section and AS 43.55.170, including the incorporation of the concepts of 26 U.S.C. 482 (Internal Revenue Code), as amended, the related or accompanying regulations of that provision, and any ruling or guidance issued by the United States Internal Revenue Service that relates to that provision.

(j) [Repealed,ยง34 ch 4 4SSLA 2016.]

(k) [Repealed,ยง34 ch 4 4SSLA 2016.]

(l) In a calendar year, after application of a producer's lease expenditures that are incurred in that calendar year, the producer may choose to apply all or a portion of a carried-forward annual loss or carry any unused portion forward. The department may not require a producer to apply all or a portion of a carried-forward annual loss in a calendar year.

(m) During a calendar year in which a taxpayer's liability under AS 43.55.011(e) is determined under AS 43.55.011(f), the maximum amount of carried-forward annual loss that a taxpayer may apply in that year is equal to the amount, when combined with the lease expenditures of the current year and any credits under this chapter, necessary to reduce the amount calculated under AS 43.55.011(e) to the equivalent amount of tax due under AS 43.55.011(f) before the application of any credits under this chapter. An amount of carried-forward annual loss not applied under this subsection may continue to be carried forward.

(n) A carried-forward annual loss may only be applied

(1) to determine the production tax value of oil or gas for a category for which a separate annual production tax value is required to be calculated under AS 43.55.160(a) or (h) if the lease expenditure resulting in the carried-forward annual loss was incurred in the same category;

(2) beginning in the calendar year in which regular production of oil or gas from the lease or property where the lease expenditure resulting in the carried-forward annual loss was incurred commences.

(o) A carried-forward annual loss for a lease expenditure incurred on a lease or property that

(1) did not commence regular production of oil or gas before or during the year the lease expenditure was incurred decreases in value each year by one-tenth of the value of the carried-forward annual loss in the preceding year, beginning January 1 of the 11th calendar year after the lease expenditure is carried forward under (a)(3) of this section; a decrease in value under this paragraph does not apply for a year in which the department determines that regular production of oil or gas did not commence because of a natural disaster, an injunction or other court order, or an administrative order;

(2) commenced regular production of oil or gas before or during the year the lease expenditure was incurred decreases in value each year by one-tenth of the value of the carried-forward annual loss in the preceding year, beginning January 1 of the eighth calendar year after the lease expenditure is carried forward under (a)(3) of this section.

(p) A carried-forward annual loss under (o) of this section may not decrease in value for a partial calendar year.

(q) For purposes of (n)(2) and (o) of this section, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission shall determine the commencement of regular production.

(r) In adopting a regulation that defines the lease or property where a lease expenditure resulting in a carried-forward annual loss is incurred for purposes of (n) and (o) of this section, the department shall include an exploration lease expenditure that is reasonably related to the lease or property.

(s) For purposes of this section,

(1) "carried-forward annual loss" means a loss established under (a)(3) of this section;

(2) "explore" includes conducting geological or geophysical exploration, including drilling a stratigraphic test well;

(3) "ordinary and necessary" has the meaning given in 26 U.S.C. 162 (Internal Revenue Code), as amended, and regulations adopted under that section;

(4) "stratigraphic test well" means a well drilled for the sole purpose of obtaining geological information to aid in exploring for an oil or gas deposit and the target zones of which are located in the state.

###### Sec. 43.55.170.   Adjustments to lease expenditures.

(a) A producer's lease expenditures under AS 43.55.165 must be adjusted by subtracting payments or credits, other than tax credits, received by the producer or by an operator acting for the producer for

(1) the use by another person of a production facility in which the producer has an ownership interest or the management by the producer of a production facility under a management agreement providing for the producer to receive a management fee;

(2) a reimbursement or similar payment that offsets the producer's lease expenditures, including an insurance recovery from a third-party insurer and a payment from the state or federal government for reimbursement of the producer's upstream costs, including costs for gathering, separating, cleaning, dehydration, compressing, or other field handling associated with the production of oil or gas upstream of the point of production;

(3) the sale or other transfer of

(A) an asset, including geological, geophysical, or well data or interpretations, acquired by the producer as a result of a lease expenditure or an expenditure that would be a lease expenditure if it were incurred after March 31, 2006; for purposes of this subparagraph,

(i) if a producer removes from the state, for use outside the state, an asset described in this subparagraph, the value of the asset at the time it is removed is considered a payment received by the producer for sale or transfer of the asset;

(ii) for a transaction that is an internal transfer or is otherwise not an arm's length transaction, if the sale or transfer of the asset is made for less than fair market value, the amount subtracted must be the fair market value; and

(B) oil or gas

(i) that is not considered produced from a lease or property under AS 43.55.020(e); and

(ii) the cost of acquiring which is a lease expenditure incurred by the person that acquires the oil or gas.

(b) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, if one or more payments or credits subject to this section are received by a producer or by an operator acting for the producer during a calendar year and if either the total amount of the payments or credits exceeds the amount of the producer's applicable lease expenditures for that calendar year or the producer has no lease expenditures for that calendar year, the producer shall nevertheless subtract those payments or credits from the lease expenditures or from zero, respectively, and the producer's applicable adjusted lease expenditures for that calendar year are a negative number and shall be applied to the pertinent calculation under AS 43.55.160(a) as a negative number.

(c) For purposes of AS 43.55.023(a) and only as to expenditures incurred to explore for an oil or gas deposit located within land in which an explorer does not own a working interest, the term "producer" in this section includes "explorer."

###### Sec. 43.55.180.   Required report.

(a) The department shall study

(1) the effects of the provisions of this chapter on oil and gas exploration, development, and production in the state, on investment expenditures for oil and gas exploration, development, and production in the state, on the entry of new producers into the oil and gas industry in the state, on state revenue, and on tax administration and compliance, giving particular attention to the tax rates provided under AS 43.55.011, the tax credits provided under AS 43.55.023ยง43.55.025, and the deductions for and adjustments to lease expenditures provided under AS 43.55.160ยง43.55.170; and

(2) the effects of the tax rates under AS 43.55.011(i) on state revenue and on oil and gas exploration, development, and production on private land, and the fairness of those tax rates for private landowners.

(b) The department shall prepare a report on or before the first day of the 2011 regular session of the legislature on the results of the study made under (a) of this section, including recommendations as to whether any changes should be made to this chapter. The department shall notify the legislature that the report prepared under this subsection is available.

(b) The Department of Natural Resources shall certify to the department the date upon which production begins, and the department shall issue a certificate of exemption to the producer accordingly.

(c) The license tax on mining is as follows: upon the net income of the taxpayer from the property in the state, computed with allowable depletion, plus royalty received in connection with mining property in the state

over $40,000 and not over $50,000 .....  3 percent

over $50,000 and not over $100,000 .....  $1,500 plus 5 percent of the excess over $50,000

over $100,000 .....  $4,000 plus 7 percent of the excess over $100,000.

(d) Where mining operations are conducted in two or more places by one person the operations are considered a single mining operation and the tax under this chapter is computed upon the aggregate income derived from all the mining operations.  The lessor of a mine operated under a lease is considered to be engaged in mining within this chapter, and the royalties received by the lessor are considered to be the net income of the lessor's mining operations.  If the lessor receives royalties from more than one mine or mining operation, the tax payable under this chapter by the lessor is computed upon the aggregate royalties received by the lessor from all the mines or mining operations as though they were a single mining operation.

(e) The allowance for depletion included as an allowable deduction from gross income is a percentage of the gross income from the property during the taxable year, excluding from the gross income an amount equal to the rents or royalties paid by the taxpayer in respect to the property, as follows:

(1) coal mines: 10 percent;

(2) metal mines, fluorspar, flake graphite, vermiculite, beryl, feldspar, mica, talc, lepidolite, spodumene, varite, ball and sagger clay, or rock asphalt mines and potash mines or deposits: 15 percent; and

(3) sulphur mines or deposits: 23 percent.

(f) The allowance for depletion may not exceed 50 percent of the net income of the taxpayer, computed without allowance for depletion, from the property, except that in no case may the depletion allowable be less than it would be if computed on a reasonable cost basis.

(g) Deductions that are not directly attributable to particular properties or processes shall be fairly allocated.  To illustrate: If the taxpayer engages in activities in addition to mineral extraction in the state and to ordinary treatment processes, deductions for depreciation, taxes, general expenses, and overhead, which cannot be directly attributed to a specific activity, shall be fairly apportioned between (1) the mineral extraction and ordinary treatment processes, and (2) the additional activities, taking into account the ratio which the operating expenses directly attributable to the mineral extraction and ordinary treatment processes bear to the operating expenses directly attributable to the additional activities.  If more than one mineral property is involved, the deductions apportioned to the mineral extraction and ordinary treatment processes shall, in turn, be fairly apportioned to the several properties taking into account their relative production.

(h) Taxes upon royalties shall be paid by the taxpayer receiving the royalties and no deduction, excepting depletion, is allowed.

(i) A license issued under this section must include

(1) the name and address of the licensee;

(2) the nature or type of mining activity to be conducted; and

(3) the year for which the license is issued.

(a) Unless a person has a business license endorsement issued under this section for each location or outlet in a location where the person offers tobacco products, electronic smoking products, or products containing nicotine for sale, a person may not sell or allow a vending machine to sell in its location or outlet cigarettes, cigars, tobacco, products containing tobacco, electronic smoking products, or products containing nicotine as a retailer at that location or outlet. Each endorsement required under this section is in addition to any other license or endorsement required by law. A person may not apply for an endorsement under this section for a location or outlet if an endorsement issued for the same location or outlet is currently suspended or revoked. An endorsement issued for a location or outlet to a person in violation of this subsection is void.

(b) The department, upon payment of a fee of $100, shall issue a business license endorsement to a person who applies for a business license under this chapter, and may renew the endorsement issued under this subsection for a fee of $100. The endorsement expires at the same time as the license to which it attaches. Upon issuance of an endorsement, the department shall also issue to the person receiving the endorsement notice of the penalties that may be imposed under this section.

However, following a hearing under (m) of this section, and based on evidence admitted at that hearing concerning questions specified in (m)(4) and (6) of this section, the department may reduce by not more than 10 days a suspension under (1) of this subsection, or by not more than 20 days a suspension under (2) of this subsection, or increase by not more than 10 days a suspension under (1) of this subsection, or by not more than 20 days a suspension under (2) of this subsection. If a hearing is not requested, or if a hearing is requested and the department determines that the evidence admitted does not support increasing or decreasing the suspension, the department shall suspend the endorsement for a period of

(1) 20 days and impose a civil penalty of $500 if the person has not been previously convicted of violating AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, or 11.76.109 and is not otherwise subject to the sanctions described in (2)ยง(4) of this subsection;

(2) 45 days and impose a civil penalty of $2,000 if, within the 24 months before the date of the department's notice under (m) of this section, the person, or an agent or employee of the person while acting within the scope of the agency or employment of the person, was convicted once of violating AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, or 11.76.109;

(4) one year and impose a civil penalty of $10,000 if, within the 24 months before the date of the department's notice under (m) of this section, the person, or an agent or employee of the person while acting within the scope of the agency or employment of the person, was convicted three or more times of violating AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, or 11.76.109.

(e) If a person who receives an endorsement under this section has multiple retail locations or outlets in a location, a suspension or revocation imposed under this section applies only to the retail outlet in the location in which the violation occurs.

(f) A person who holds a license endorsement issued under this section shall post on the licensed premises a warning sign as described in this subsection. A warning sign required by this subsection must be at least 8.5 inches by 11 inches and must read: "The sale of electronic smoking products or products containing nicotine without a prescription or tobacco products to persons under age 19 is illegal." A person holding an endorsement issued under this section shall display the warning sign in a manner conspicuous to a person purchasing or consuming tobacco products, electronic smoking products, or products containing nicotine on the licensed premises. The department shall make available the warning signs required under this section to a person who holds an endorsement issued under this section or a person who requests the sign with the intention of displaying it.

(g) A person who is required to hold a business license endorsement under this section, or who is required to be licensed or agrees to be licensed under AS 43.50.010, or an agent or employee of the person, may not

(1) sell cigarettes to another person unless the cigarettes are sold in groups of at least 20 and the cigarettes are in the manufacturer's original cigarette pack or contained in a cigarette carton or box; or

(2) sell or possess cigarettes if the cigarette package

(A) differs in any respect from the requirements of 15 U.S.C. 1331ยง1341 (Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act) for the placement of warnings or of any other information upon a package of cigarettes that is sold within the United States;

(B) is labeled "For Export Only," "U.S. Tax Exempt," "For Use Outside U.S.," or with similar wording indicating that the manufacturer did not intend that the product be sold in the United States; this subparagraph does not apply to cigarettes sold or intended to be sold as duty-free merchandise by a duty-free sales enterprise under 19 U.S.C. 1555(b); however, this subparagraph does apply to duty-free cigarettes that are brought back into the state for resale in the state;

(C) has been altered by adding, masking, or deleting wording described in (B) of this paragraph.

(h) A violation of (g) of this section is an unfair or deceptive act or practice under AS 45.50.471.

After notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the commissioner or the commissioner of revenue shall destroy cigarettes, electronic smoking products, or products containing nicotine seized under this subsection.

(j) A person who violates (g) of this section is guilty of a class B misdemeanor.

(k) If a person, or an agent or employee of the person while acting within the scope of the agency or employment of the person, violates a provision of (a) or (g) of this section, the department may suspend the person's business license endorsement or right to obtain a business license endorsement for a period of not more than

(1) 45 days; or

(2) 90 days if, within the 24 months before the date of the department's notice under (m) of this section, the person, or an agent or employee of the person while acting within the scope of the agency or employment of the person, violates a provision of (a) or (g) of this section.

(l) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, a person owning vending machines that offer tobacco products, electronic smoking products, or products containing nicotine for sale need obtain only one business license endorsement under this section even if the person has vending machines in more than one outlet or location in the state. The person who owns a vending machine that offers tobacco products, electronic smoking products, or products containing nicotine for sale and the person who owns the premises where the vending machine is located are both required to obtain a business license endorsement issued under this section. If the endorsement of the person owning the vending machine is suspended or revoked, the person may not sell cigarettes, cigars, products containing tobacco, electronic smoking products, or products containing nicotine during the period of suspension or revocation through the use of vending machines at the location or outlet where the violation occurred. During the period of suspension or revocation, the person owning that vending machine may not use that machine to sell tobacco products, electronic smoking products, or products containing nicotine at another location or outlet.

(m) The department may initiate suspension of a business license endorsement or the right to obtain a business license endorsement under this section by sending the person subject to the suspension a notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by delivering the notice to the person. The notice must contain information that informs the person of the grounds for suspension, the length of any suspension sought, and the person's right to administrative review. A suspension begins 30 days after receipt of notice described in this subsection unless the person delivers a timely written request for a hearing to the department in the manner provided by regulations of the department. If a hearing is requested under this subsection, an administrative law judge of the office of administrative hearings (AS 44.64.010) shall determine the issues by using the preponderance of the evidence test and shall, to the extent they do not conflict with regulations adopted under AS 44.64.060, conduct the hearing in the manner provided by regulations of the department.

(2) if the department does not allege a conviction of AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, or 11.76.109, did the person, or an agent or employee of the person while acting within the scope of the agency or employment of the person, violate a provision of (a) or (g) of this section;

(3) within the 24 months before the date of the department's notice under this subsection, was the person, or an agent or employee of the person while acting within the scope of the agency or employment of the person, convicted of violating AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, or 11.76.109 or adjudicated for violating a provision of (a) or (g) of this section;

(C) engaged at a location owned by the person in other conduct that was or is likely to result in the sale of tobacco, electronic smoking products, or products containing nicotine to a person under 19 years of age in violation of AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, or 11.76.109.

(n) The commissioner may

(1) adopt the proposed decision of a hearing officer under this section;

(2) remand the matter for further proceedings; or

(3) reject the proposed decision, review the record, and issue a decision based on the record.

(o) After notice and a hearing, the department may revoke a business license endorsement or increase a period of suspension if the department finds that, during a period of suspension, a person continues the conduct for which the endorsement or the right to obtain an endorsement was suspended. A person whose endorsement or right to obtain an endorsement is revoked or suspended under this subsection may not apply for or obtain an endorsement under this chapter. A period of revocation or suspension imposed under this subsection may not exceed two years.

(r) For purposes of this section, the sale of a product containing tobacco, an electronic smoking product, or a product containing nicotine by an agent or employee of a person who holds or is required to hold a business license endorsement under this section at the location or outlet in a location for which the endorsement was, or was required to be, issued is rebuttably presumed to have been a sale within the person's scope of agency or employment.

(s) If a person violates (a) of this section, the department may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for each day of the violation. The total civil penalty imposed under this subsection for each violation may not exceed $5,000.

(2) informed the person's agents and employees of the applicable laws and their requirements and conducted training on complying with the laws and requirements;

(3) required each agent and employee of the person to sign a form stating that the agent and employee has been informed of and understands the written policy and the requirements of AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, and 11.76.109;

(4) determined that the agents and employees of the person had sufficient experience and ability to comply with the written policy and requirements of AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, and 11.76.109;

(5) required the agents and employees of the person to verify the age of purchasers of cigarettes, cigars, tobacco, other products containing tobacco, electronic smoking products, or products containing nicotine by means of a valid government issued photographic identification;

(6) established and enforced disciplinary sanctions for noncompliance with the written policy or the requirements of AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, and 11.76.109; and

(7) monitored the compliance of the agents and employees of the person with the written policy and the requirements of AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, and 11.76.109.

(u) A reduction in the period of suspension under this section may not be granted more than once in a 12-month period for a location or outlet in a location for which the person holds a business license.

(v) Notwithstanding (d) of this section, in place of a hearing under (m) of this section, the department and the person holding the business license endorsement may enter into a memorandum of agreement regarding the imposition of a suspension and civil penalties based on a violation of AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, or 11.76.109. The memorandum of agreement must contain a provision that the person holding the business license endorsement admits or does not contest that a violation of AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, or 11.76.109 occurred and accepts the imposition of suspension and civil penalty under this section. Based on the memorandum of agreement, the department may reduce the period of suspension. For violations involving AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, or 11.76.109, the department may not reduce the period of suspension by more than 10 days under (d)(1) of this section or by more than 20 days under (d)(2) of this section. The department may not agree to a reduction in the period of suspension more than once in a 12-month time period for a location or outlet in a location for which the person holds a business license endorsement.

(w) For purposes of (m)(5) of this section, a conviction for a violation of AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, or 11.76.109 by the agent or employee of the person who holds the business license endorsement is rebuttably presumed to constitute proof of the fact that the agent or employee negligently sold a cigarette, a cigar, or tobacco, a product containing tobacco, an electronic smoking product, or a product containing nicotine to a person under 19 years of age. The person who holds the business license endorsement may overcome the presumption by establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the agent or employee did not negligently sell a cigarette, a cigar, or tobacco, a product containing tobacco, an electronic smoking product, or a product containing nicotine to a person under 19 years of age in violation of AS 11.76.100, 11.76.106, 11.76.107, or 11.76.109 as alleged in the citation issued to the agent or employee. The presentation of evidence authorized by this subsection does not constitute a collateral attack on the conviction described in this subsection.

(x) Notwithstanding (d), (t), or (v) of this section, a period of suspension may not be reduced for a violation of AS 11.76.100(a)(4) or 11.76.109(a)(4).

(c) Instead of a license issued under (a) of this section, the department may issue a direct marketing fisheries business license to a licensed commercial fisherman who processes fishery resources caught using a vessel that does not exceed 65 feet in overall length and is owned or leased by the commercial fisherman. The licensee may place into commerce in the state and outside of the state processed or unprocessed fishery resources caught using the vessel described in the license. Fishery resources that are caught using the vessel and owned by the licensee from the time of harvest through sale, as defined by the department by regulation, may be processed by the licensee on the vessel, at a shore-based facility, or by means of custom processing services obtained by the licensee. An application for a direct marketing fisheries business license shall be filed with the department and accompanied by an annual fee of $25. A separate direct marketing fisheries business license and annual license fee are required for each vessel on which processing is performed. The application must state the name and address of the applicant, the fishery resources for which the applicant holds a commercial fishing entry permit or interim-use permit or quota share, a description of the vessel and each shore-based facility where the applicant will process fishery resources, and other information that the department prescribes by regulation.

If a receiver, trustee, or assign is operating the property or business, that person shall file the return for the person. A tax due on the basis of such a return shall be collected in the same manner as if collected from the person of whose business the receiver, trustee, or assign has custody and control.

(b) The return shall be made on a calendar year basis and submitted to the department before April 1 after the close of the calendar year.

(c) The department may adopt regulations for the granting of a reasonable extension of time for filing and may grant an extension of time for filing.

###### Sec. 43.75.037.   Fisheries product development tax credit. [See delayed repeal note.]

(a) Except as provided in (f) of this section, a taxpayer that is a fisheries business may claim a fisheries product development tax credit of 50 percent of qualified investment in new property first placed into service in a shore-based plant or on a vessel in the state in the tax year.

(b) The amount of the tax credit applied against taxes under this section may not

(1) exceed 50 percent of the taxpayer's tax liability incurred under this chapter for processing of eligible fish during the tax year; or

(2) be claimed for property first placed into service after December 31, 2026.

(c) If the property for which a tax credit is claimed is installed on a vessel, the amount of qualified investment under (a) of this section is determined by multiplying the investment cost of the qualified investment property by a fraction, the numerator of which is the weight of raw eligible fish processed on the vessel by the taxpayer in the state in the tax year in which the property is first placed into service, and the denominator of which is the weight of raw eligible fish processed on the vessel by the taxpayer in and outside of the state in the tax year in which the property is first placed into service. In this subsection, "eligible fish" does not include pollock, sablefish, or Pacific cod.

(d) An unused credit under this section may be carried forward and applied against the tax liability incurred on eligible fish in the following three tax years.

(e) Qualified investment costs on which a tax credit is claimed under this section may not be considered for another tax credit in this title.

(B) that has been removed from the state; and

(C) that was purchased in the previous 10 years; or

(g) If, during a tax year, property for which a credit was claimed under this section is disposed of by the taxpayer, ceases to be qualified investment property, or is removed from service in the state, the tax due under this chapter is increased by the recapture percentage of the aggregate decrease in the credit allowed under this section for all prior tax years that would have resulted solely from reducing to zero the credit allowed for the qualified investment property under this section. The amount of tax credit attributable to the qualified investment that is carried forward from prior tax years is terminated as of the first day of the tax year in which the qualified investment property is disposed of by the taxpayer, ceases to be qualified investment property, or is removed from service in the state. For purposes of this subsection,

(1) the recapture percentage during the year in which the property is first placed into service or during the first year following the year in which the property is first placed into service is 100 percent;

(2) the recapture percentage during the second year following the year in which the property is first placed into service is 75 percent;

(3) the recapture percentage during the third year following the year in which the property is first placed into service is 50 percent;

(4) the recapture percentage during the fourth or later year following the year in which the property is first placed into service is zero percent;

(5) qualified investment property used on a vessel is considered to have been removed from the state on the first day of a tax year in which the proportion of raw eligible fish processed in the state on the vessel is less than 50 percent of total weight of raw eligible fish processed on the vessel in and outside of the state.

(h) The amount of a tax credit recaptured under (g)(1)ยง(3) of this section may not be included in the determination of the amount of that tax credit that is allowable under this section.

(i) The department shall develop and implement procedures by which a taxpayer that is a fisheries business may submit the taxpayer's proposed investment to the department and request a preliminary determination of whether the investment qualifies for the fisheries product development tax credit under this section. A preliminary determination by the department that the taxpayer's submission qualifies for the credit is binding, unless the department determines that the taxpayer has made a material misrepresentation in the taxpayer's submission.

(j) To claim a credit under this section, a taxpayer shall agree that the department may make public the number of recipients and the total amount of tax credits claimed for each type of eligible fish. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in AS 40.25.100 or AS 43.05.230, the number of recipients and the total amount of tax credits claimed for each type of eligible fish is public information.

(k) In this section,

(1) "eligible fish" means, except as otherwise provided in (c) of this section, salmon, herring, pollock, sablefish, or Pacific cod;

(5) any other remedies provided by law or in equity.

###### Sec. 43.90.240.   Abandonment of project.

(a) If the commissioners and the licensee agree that the project is uneconomic, the project shall be abandoned, the inducement provided for in AS 43.90.110 shall be terminated, and, except for requirements imposed on the licensee under (e) of this section and AS 43.90.220, the state and the licensee no longer have an obligation under this chapter with respect to the license.

(b) If the commissioners or the licensee determines that the project is uneconomic and the other party disagrees, the disagreement shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under the substantive and procedural laws of this state, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in superior court in the state. In the event of arbitration, each party shall select an arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association's National Roster, and the two arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association's National Roster who shall serve as the chair of the three-member arbitration panel. If the arbitration panel determines that the project is

(1) uneconomic, the state and the licensee no longer have an obligation under this chapter with respect to the license, except for requirements imposed on the licensee under (e) of this section and AS 43.90.220; or

(2) not uneconomic, the obligations of the licensee and the state continue as provided under this chapter and the license.

(c) The arbitration panel in (b) of this section shall make a determination that the project is uneconomic only if the panel finds that the party claiming the project is uneconomic has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the

(1) project does not have credit support sufficient to finance construction of the project through firm transportation commitments, government assistance, or other external sources of financing; and

(2) predicted costs of transportation at a 100 percent load factor, when deducted from predicted gas sales revenue using publicly available predictions of future gas prices, would result in a producer rate of return that is below the rate typically accepted by a prudent oil and gas exploration and production company for incremental upstream investment that is required to produce and deliver gas to the project.

(d) If the state makes a payment to the licensee under AS 43.90.440, the license is considered abandoned, and the state and the licensee no longer have any obligations under this chapter with respect to the license, except that the licensee must comply with the

(b) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, a state agency may not include in any project certificate, right-of-way, permit, or other authorization issued to the licensee a term or condition that is not required by law if the coordinator determines that the term or condition would prevent or impair in any significant respect the expeditious construction and operation or expansion of the project.

(c) Unless required by law, a state agency may not add to, amend, or abrogate any certificate, right-of-way, permit, or other authorization issued to a licensee if the coordinator determines that the action would prevent or impair in any significant respect the expeditious construction, operation, or expansion of the project.

#### Article 3. Resource Inducements.

###### Sec. 43.90.300.   Qualification for resource inducements.

(a) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, a lessee or other person that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioners that the person has committed to acquire firm transportation capacity in the first binding open season of the project is qualified to receive the resource inducement set out in AS 43.90.310 and 43.90.320 for gas produced on the North Slope and shipped in firm transportation capacity acquired in the first binding open season of the project. The inducement in AS 43.90.310 is contractual.

(b) A gas producer receiving a voucher under AS 43.90.330 is qualified to receive the resource inducement in AS 43.90.310 and 43.90.320 for the gas shipped in the firm transportation capacity described in the voucher for the period described in AS 43.90.330.

###### Sec. 43.90.310.   Royalty inducement.

(a) Before the start of the first binding open season to be conducted by the licensee, the commissioner of natural resources shall adopt regulations that establish a method to determine the monthly value of the state's royalty share of gas production and establish terms under which the state will exercise its right to switch between taking its royalty in value or in kind for gas committed for firm transportation in the first binding open season of the project or shipped in the firm transportation capacity described in a voucher received by the gas producer under AS 43.90.330. The regulations must

(1) minimize retroactive adjustments to the monthly value of the state's royalty share of gas production;

(2) provide a method for establishing a fair market value for each component of the state's royalty gas that is based on pricing data from reliable and widely available industry trade publications and that uses appropriate adjustments to reflect

(A) deductions for actual and reasonable transportation costs for the state's royalty gas, including a reasonable share of the costs associated with unused capacity commitments on gas pipelines from the North Slope to the first destination market with reasonable market liquidity;

(B) location differentials between the destination markets where North Slope gas could be sold;

(C) reasonable and actual costs for gas processing; in this subparagraph, "gas processing" means post-production treatment of gas to extract natural gas liquids; and

(D) deductions permitted under the 1980 Royalty Settlement Agreement for Prudhoe Bay gas; and

(3) establish terms under which the state will exercise its authority to switch between taking its royalty gas in value and in kind to ensure that the state's actions do not unreasonably

(A) cause the lessee or other person to bear disproportionate transportation costs with respect to the state's royalty gas;

(B) interfere with the lessee's or other person's long-term marketing of its production.

(b) If a lessee or other person qualified for a resource inducement under AS 43.90.300 agrees under (c) of this section, the lessee or other person is entitled to elect

(1) to calculate its gas royalty obligation under the regulations adopted under (a) of this section for natural gas transported on a firm contract executed during the project's first binding open season or under the methodology set out in the existing leases from which the gas is produced, and

(A) upon the request of the lessee, the commissioner of natural resources shall contractually amend the existing lease to effect the election under this paragraph and incorporate as fixed contract terms the relevant regulatory provisions; and

(B) the election under this paragraph remains in effect until new regulations are adopted as a result of a review under (d) of this section, at which time, a lessee or other person qualified under AS 43.90.300 may change its election under this paragraph; upon the request of the lessee, the commissioner of natural resources shall contractually amend the lease to incorporate as fixed contract terms the relevant revised regulatory provisions;

(2) to enter into a contract with the state that amends the existing lease terms by providing a mechanism that ensures that, when the state exercises its right to switch between taking its royalty in value or in kind for gas committed for firm transportation in the first binding open season of the project, the lessee or other person does not bear disproportionate transportation costs with respect to the state's royalty gas; and by modifying the required period of notice that the state must provide before exercising the state's right to switch between taking its royalty in value or in kind for gas committed for firm transportation in the first binding open season of the project.

(c) To claim the inducement under (b) of this section, a lessee or other person qualified under AS 43.90.300 shall agree, on an application form provided by the Department of Natural Resources, that the lessee or other person, and the lessee's or other person's affiliates, successors, assigns, and agents, will not protest or appeal a filing by the licensee to roll in expansion costs of the mainline up to a level that is required in AS 43.90.130(7) if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does not have a rebuttable presumption in effect that rolled-in treatment applies to the cost of the expansion of the project. The agreement not to protest may not preclude the lessee or other person, or the lessee's or other person's affiliates, successors, assigns, and agents, from protesting a filing to roll in mainline expansion costs that the licensee is not required to propose and support under AS 43.90.130(7).

(d) The commissioner of natural resources shall provide for review of the regulations adopted under (a) of this section at least every two years after the commencement of commercial operations to determine whether the regulations continue to meet the requirements of (a) of this section under current conditions, and shall amend the regulations when the requirements are not being met.

(e) No provision of this chapter precludes the election set out in (b) of this section, nor may the commissioner of natural resources assert any provision of any existing lease or unit agreement as precluding the elections set out in (b) of this section.

###### Sec. 43.90.320.   Gas production tax exemption.

(a) If a person qualified for a resource inducement under AS 43.90.300 agrees under (c) of this section, the person is entitled to an annual exemption from the state's gas production tax in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the person's gas production tax obligation calculated under the gas production tax in effect during that tax year and the amount of the person's gas production tax obligation calculated under the gas production tax in effect at the start of the first binding open season held under this chapter. If the difference is less than zero, the gas production tax exemption is zero.

(b) The exemption under this section may be applied within 10 years immediately following commencement of commercial operations and only applied to production taxes that are levied on North Slope gas shipped through firm transportation capacity the person acquired during the first binding open season or shipped in the firm transportation capacity described in a voucher received by the gas producer under AS 43.90.330.

(c) The person claiming the exemption under this section shall agree that the person, and the person's affiliates, successors, assigns, and agents, will not protest or appeal a filing by the licensee to roll in mainline expansion costs up to the level that the licensee is required to propose and support under AS 43.90.130(7) if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does not have a rebuttable presumption in effect that rolled-in treatment applies to the cost of the expansion of the project. The agreement required under this subsection may not preclude the person, or the person's affiliates, successors, assigns, and agents, from protesting a filing to roll in mainline expansion costs that the licensee is not required to propose and support under AS 43.90.130(7).

(d) In this section, "gas production tax" means the tax levied on the production of gas under AS 43.55.

###### Sec. 43.90.330.   Inducement vouchers.

(a) A person that acquires firm transportation capacity in the first binding open season of the project, that does not hold an oil and gas lease on the North Slope, and that is not an affiliate of a person that holds an oil and gas lease on the North Slope may apply to the commissioners for a voucher under this section. A voucher issued by the commissioners must describe the firm transportation capacity in the project to which the voucher is applicable.

(b) A voucher issued by the commissioners under this section entitles the holder of the voucher to the resource inducements in AS 43.90.310 and 43.90.320 for gas shipped in the firm transportation capacity acquired by the person applying for the voucher during the first binding open season of the project and described in the voucher. The voucher may be transferred to a gas producer that has a binding obligation to sell gas to the person transferring the voucher under a gas purchase agreement.

(c) A gas producer holding a voucher may claim the resource inducements for gas shipped through the firm transportation capacity described in the voucher and only on gas that is produced and delivered to the purchaser on the North Slope. A gas producer may claim the resource inducements under this subsection until the earlier of the termination of the binding gas purchase agreement or the expiration of the inducements by operation of law.

(d) A person that receives a voucher under this section and a gas producer that receives resource inducements under a voucher shall agree that the person and the gas producer and their respective affiliates, successors, assigns, or agents will not protest or appeal a filing by the licensee to roll in mainline expansion costs up to the level that the licensee is required to propose and support under AS 43.90.130(7) if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does not have a rebuttable presumption in effect that rolled-in treatment applies to the cost of the expansion of the project. The agreement required under this subsection may not preclude the person or gas producer or their respective affiliates, successors, assigns, or agents from protesting a filing to roll in mainline expansion costs that the licensee is not required to propose and support under AS 43.90.130(7).

#### Article 4. Miscellaneous Provisions.

###### Sec. 43.90.400.   Alaska Gasline Inducement Act reimbursement fund; disbursements; audits.

(a) There is established in the general fund an Alaska Gasline Inducement Act reimbursement fund. The fund consists of money appropriated to it by the legislature for disbursement to pay the state's reimbursements under AS 43.90.110.
