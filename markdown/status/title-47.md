###### Sec. 47.06.020.   Purpose and policy related to children.

The purpose of this title as it relates to children is to secure for each child the care and guidance, preferably in the child's own home, that will serve the moral, emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the child and the best interests of the community; to preserve and strengthen the child's family ties unless efforts to preserve and strengthen the ties are likely to result in physical or emotional damage to the child, removing the child from the custody of the parents only as a last resort when the child's welfare or safety or the protection of the public cannot be adequately safeguarded without removal; and, when the child is removed from the family, to secure for the child adequate custody and care and adequate planning for permanent placement of the child. It is the policy of the state to acknowledge and take into account the principles of early childhood and youth brain development and, whenever possible, consider the concepts of early adversity, toxic stress, childhood trauma, and the promotion of resilience through protective relationships, supports, self-regulation, and services.

###### Sec. 47.06.030.   Legislative findings related to children.

The legislature finds that

(1)  parents have the following rights and responsibilities relating to the care and control of their child while the child is a minor:

(A)  the responsibility to provide the child with food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care;

(B)  the right and responsibility to protect, nurture, train, and discipline the child, including the right to direct the child's medical care and the right to exercise reasonable corporal discipline;

(C)  the right to determine where and with whom the child shall live;

(D)  the right and responsibility to make decisions of legal or financial significance concerning the child;

(E)  the right to obtain representation for the child in legal actions; and

(F)  the responsibility to provide special safeguards and care, including appropriate prenatal and postnatal protection for the child;

(2)  it is the policy of the state to strengthen families and to protect children from child abuse and neglect; the state recognizes that, in some cases, protection of a child may require removal of the child from the child's home; however,

(A)  except in those cases involving serious risk to a child's health or safety, the Department of Family and Community Services and the Department of Health should provide time-limited family support services to the child and the child's family in order to offer parents the opportunity to remedy parental conduct or conditions in the home that placed the child at risk of harm so that a child may return home safely and permanently; and

(B)  the state also recognizes that when a child is removed from the home, visitation between the child and the child's parents or guardian and family members reduces the trauma for the child and enhances the likelihood that the child will be able to return home; therefore, whenever a child is removed from the parental home, the Department of Family and Community Services should encourage frequent, regular, and reasonable visitation of the child with the child's parent or guardian and family members;

(3)  it is the policy of the state to recognize that, when a child is a ward of the state, the child is entitled to reasonable safety, adequate care, and adequate treatment and that the Department of Family and Community Services as legal custodian and the child's guardian ad litem as guardian of the child's best interests and their agents and assignees, each should make reasonable efforts to ensure that the child is provided with reasonable safety, adequate care, and adequate treatment for the duration of time that the child is a ward of the state;

(4)  it is in the best interests of a child who has been removed from the child's own home for the state to apply the following principles in resolving the situation:

(A)  the child should be placed in a safe, secure, and stable environment;

(B)  the child should not be moved unnecessarily;

(C)  a planning process should be followed to lead to permanent placement of the child;

(D)  every effort should be made to encourage psychological attachment between the adult caregiver and the child;

(E)  frequent, regular, and reasonable visitation with the parent or guardian and family members should be encouraged;

(F)  parents and guardians must actively participate in family support services so as to facilitate the child's being able to remain in the home; when children are removed from the home, the parents and guardians must actively participate in family support services to make return of their children to the home possible; and

(G)  to the extent practicable, the Department of Family and Community Services should enable a child's contact with previous out-of-home caregivers when appropriate and in the best interests of the child;

(5)  numerous studies establish that

(A) children undergo a critical attachment process before the time they reach six years of age;

(B) a child who has not attached with an adult caregiver during this critical stage will suffer significant emotional damage that frequently leads to chronic psychological problems and antisocial behavior when the child reaches adolescence and adulthood; and

(C) it is important to provide for an expedited placement procedure to ensure that all children, especially those under the age of six years, who have been removed from their homes are placed in permanent homes expeditiously.

###### Sec. 47.06.040.   Material incorporated by reference.

Under AS 44.62.245(a)(2), in adopting or amending a regulation that incorporates a document or other material by reference, the department may incorporate future amended versions of the document or other material if the document or other material is

###### Sec. 47.06.060.   Authorization of the Interstate Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance.

(a)  The Department of Family and Community Services and the Department of Health, in cooperation, may, on behalf of the state, enter into the Interstate Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance and supplementary agreements with agencies of other states for the provision of adoption and medical assistance under AS 47.07 and other provisions of this title for eligible children with special needs.

(b)  In this section, "state" includes a state, territory, possession, or commonwealth of the United States.

###### Sec. 47.06.070.   Monthly reports concerning children.

By the 15th day of each month, the Department of Family and Community Services shall provide a report summarizing child protection activities carried out during the previous calendar month and the status of children committed to the department's custody, including information on the number and type of reports of child abuse and neglect received, the outcome of investigations completed, the number of placements of children committed to the department's custody, and the number of foster homes licensed. The report shall be made accessible to the public through the Internet.

###### Sec. 47.06.080.   Contracts.

(a)  The department may contract with a person or local government for the delivery of services to be provided by the department under AS 47.06.010 if the commissioner of family and community services determines the service will be provided at less cost to the state or will be provided in a more effective manner.

It is the public policy of the state to cooperate and coordinate with the United States government and its agencies in providing for and administering federal and state laws for adult public assistance and the other assistance that is provided for or extended to the people of the state.

###### Sec. 47.06.100.   Definition.

In AS 47.06.010§47.06.100, unless the context otherwise requires, "department" means Department of Family and Community Services.

## Chapter 07. Medical Assistance for Needy Persons.

###### Sec. 47.07.010.   Purpose.

It is declared by the legislature as a matter of public concern that the needy persons of this state who are eligible for medical care at public expense under this chapter should seek only uniform and high quality care that is appropriate to their condition and cost-effective to the state and receive that care, regardless of race, age, national origin, or economic standing. It is equally a matter of public concern that providers of services under this chapter should operate honestly, responsibly, and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in order to maintain the integrity and fiscal viability of the state's medical assistance program, and that those who do not operate in this manner should be held accountable for their conduct. It is vital that the department administer this chapter in a manner that promotes effective, long-term cost containment of the state's medical assistance expenditures while providing medical care to recipients. Accordingly, this chapter authorizes the department to apply for participation in the national medical assistance program as provided for under 42 U.S.C. 1396§1396p (Title XIX, Social Security Act).

###### Sec. 47.07.020.   Eligible persons.

(b) The department shall, on a monthly basis, evaluate what types of services are available in the state for inpatient psychiatric care for persons under 21 years of age. If inpatient psychiatric services that are consistent with the person's clinical diagnosis and that appropriately address the person's needs become available at a location in the state for a person under 21 years of age who is receiving the services under this chapter at a location outside the state, the department shall, as a condition of continued eligibility for coverage of the services under this chapter, require the person to be transferred to the in-state facility unless the department determines that the transfer would be detrimental to the person's health, established therapeutic relationship, or clinical need.

(a) The department shall develop a program to provide supplemental reimbursement to eligible emergency medical transportation service providers for the cost of providing services to medical assistance recipients. Except as provided in (b) of this section, the amount of the supplemental reimbursement paid to a provider must be equal to the amount of federal financial participation that the department receives for the nonfederal matching funds paid by the provider through intergovernmental transfers or certified public expenditures, less any administrative fee described in (d) or (e) of this section. Under the program, the department shall use intergovernmental transfers, or certified public expenditures, or both, for the nonfederal share of emergency medical transportation services that are eligible for federal financial participation under the medical assistance program.

(b) The amount a provider receives in supplemental reimbursements under the program, when combined with the amount the provider receives from all other sources, including medical assistance reimbursement under the state plan, may not exceed the provider's actual cost for providing emergency medical transportation services to medical assistance recipients.

The administrative fee may not exceed 20 percent of the nonfederal share the provider pays to the department. A provider may include the administrative fee in the provider's cost for providing an emergency medical transportation service to a medical assistance recipient.

(e) If the department authorizes the use of certified public expenditures under the program, the department may establish an administrative fee for a provider. If the department establishes an administrative fee under this subsection, the department may allow a provider to include the administrative fee in the provider's cost for providing an emergency medical transportation service to a medical assistance recipient.

(f) This section authorizes the department to provide supplemental reimbursements to a ground, water, or air emergency medical transportation service provider only if the United States Department of Health and Human Services approves payments to that type of emergency medical transportation service provider.

(g) If the United States Department of Health and Human Services revokes approval of the program, the department shall provide notice to the legislature. The department shall submit written notice to the secretary of the senate and the chief clerk of the house of representatives as early as possible after the United States Department of Health and Human Services expresses its intent to revoke approval of the program.

(2) follow the findings set out in AS 47.06.030.

###### Sec. 47.10.010.   Jurisdiction; guardians and attorneys; support.

###### Sec. 47.10.011.   Children in need of aid.

Subject to AS 47.10.019, the court may find a child to be a child in need of aid if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the child has been subjected to any of the following:

(1) a parent or guardian has abandoned the child as described in AS 47.10.013, and the other parent is absent or has committed conduct or created conditions that cause the child to be a child in need of aid under this chapter;

(2) a parent, guardian, or custodian is incarcerated, the other parent is absent or has committed conduct or created conditions that cause the child to be a child in need of aid under this chapter, and the incarcerated parent has not made adequate arrangements for the child;

(3) a custodian with whom the child has been left is unwilling or unable to provide care, supervision, or support for the child, and the whereabouts of the parent or guardian is unknown;

(4) the child is in need of medical treatment to cure, alleviate, or prevent substantial physical harm or is in need of treatment for mental injury and the child's parent, guardian, or custodian has knowingly failed to provide the treatment;

(5) the child is habitually absent from home or refuses to accept available care and the child's conduct places the child at substantial risk of physical or mental injury;

(6) the child has suffered substantial physical harm, or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer substantial physical harm, as a result of conduct by or conditions created by the child's parent, guardian, or custodian or by the failure of the parent, guardian, or custodian to supervise the child adequately;

(7) the child has suffered sexual abuse, or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer sexual abuse, as a result of conduct by or conditions created by the child's parent, guardian, or custodian or by the failure of the parent, guardian, or custodian to adequately supervise the child; if a parent, guardian, or custodian has actual notice that a person has been convicted of a sex offense against a minor within the past 15 years, is registered or required to register as a sex offender under AS 12.63, or is under investigation for a sex offense against a minor, and the parent, guardian, or custodian subsequently allows a child to be left with that person, this conduct constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of being sexually abused;

(8) conduct by or conditions created by the parent, guardian, or custodian have

(A) resulted in mental injury to the child; or

(B) placed the child at substantial risk of mental injury as a result of

(i) a pattern of rejecting, terrorizing, ignoring, isolating, or corrupting behavior that would, if continued, result in mental injury; or

(ii) exposure to conduct by a household member, as defined in AS 18.66.990, against another household member that is a crime under AS 11.41.100§11.41.220, 11.41.230(a)(1) or (2), or 11.41.410§11.41.432, an offense under a law or ordinance of another jurisdiction having elements similar to a crime under AS 11.41.100§11.41.220, 11.41.230(a)(1) or (2), or 11.41.410§11.41.432, an attempt to commit an offense that is a crime under AS 11.41.100§11.41.220 or 11.41.410§11.41.432, or an attempt to commit an offense under a law or ordinance of another jurisdiction having elements similar to a crime under AS 11.41.100§11.41.220 or 11.41.410§11.41.432; or

(iii) repeated exposure to conduct by a household member, as defined in AS 18.66.990, against another household member that is a crime under AS 11.41.230(a)(3) or 11.41.250§11.41.270 or an offense under a law or ordinance of another jurisdiction having elements similar to a crime under AS 11.41.230(a)(3) or 11.41.250§11.41.270;

(10) the parent, guardian, or custodian's ability to parent has been substantially impaired by the addictive or habitual use of an intoxicant, and the addictive or habitual use of the intoxicant has resulted in a substantial risk of harm to the child; if a court has previously found that a child is a child in need of aid under this paragraph, the resumption of use of an intoxicant by a parent, guardian, or custodian within one year after rehabilitation is prima facie evidence that the ability to parent is substantially impaired and the addictive or habitual use of the intoxicant has resulted in a substantial risk of harm to the child as described in this paragraph;

(11) the parent, guardian, or custodian has a mental illness, serious emotional disturbance, or mental deficiency of a nature and duration that places the child at substantial risk of physical harm or mental injury;

(12) the child has committed an illegal act as a result of pressure, guidance, or approval from the child's parent, guardian, or custodian.

###### Sec. 47.10.013.   Abandonment.

(a) For purposes of this chapter, the court may find abandonment of a child if a parent or guardian has shown a conscious disregard of parental responsibilities toward the child by failing to provide reasonable support, maintain regular contact, or provide normal supervision, considering the child's age and need for care by an adult. Abandonment of a child also includes instances when the parent or guardian, without justifiable cause,

(1) left the child with another person without provision for the child's support and without meaningful communication with the child for a period of three months;

(2) has made only minimal efforts to support and communicate with the child;

(3) failed for a period of at least six months to maintain regular visitation with the child;

(4) failed to participate in a suitable plan or program designed to reunite the parent or guardian with the child;

(5) left the child without affording means of identifying the child and the child's parent or guardian;

(6) was absent from the home for a period of time that created a substantial risk of serious harm to a child left in the home;

(7) failed to respond to notice of child protective proceedings; or

(8) was unwilling to provide care, support, or supervision for the child.

(b) For purposes of (a) of this section, a parent or guardian who is a victim of domestic violence, or who has a child in the parent's or guardian's care who is the victim of domestic violence, is considered to have justifiable cause to take an action or to fail to take an action that would otherwise be considered to be abandonment of a child under (a) of this section if the action or failure to act is necessary to protect the parent or guardian, or a child in the care of the parent or guardian, from further acts of domestic violence. However, a parent or guardian who initially had justifiable cause to act or fail to act as described in this subsection may be considered to have abandoned the child without justifiable cause for purposes of (a) of this section if the parent or guardian does not take reasonable steps to reunify with or provide care for the abandoned child after becoming secure from further acts of domestic violence or after providing that another child in the care of the parent or guardian is secure from further acts of domestic violence.

(c) A parent who is immune from prosecution under AS 11.81.500 and chooses to surrender an infant shall surrender the infant in the manner described in this subsection. Surrendering the infant in the manner described in this subsection constitutes abandonment for purposes of this chapter. An infant's parent is considered to have abandoned the infant safely, and, notwithstanding AS 25.20.030 and AS 47.10.120, the parent's legal duty to support the infant is extinguished if

(1) the parent, without expressing an intent to return for the infant, leaves the infant in the physical custody of a person who is a

(A) person the parent reasonably believes would provide for the health and safety of the infant and who would act appropriately to care for the infant;

(B) peace officer, community health aide, physician, or hospital employee; or

(C) person who is employed by or is a volunteer for a fire department or emergency medical service, if the person is acting within the scope of the person's fire department or emergency medical service duties; and

(2) there is no evidence the infant has been physically injured before abandonment.

(d) A person to whom an infant is surrendered in the manner described in (c)(1)(B) or (C) of this section shall

(1) act appropriately to care for the infant;

(2) inform the parent that the parent may, but is not required to, answer any questions regarding the name, identity, and medical history of the infant and parents of the infant unless the parent chooses to contact the department under (3) of this subsection;

(3) ask the parent if the parent wishes to relinquish the parent's parental rights and release the infant for adoption; if the answer is affirmative, the person shall contact the department so that the parent can discuss that option with the department;

(4) immediately notify the nearest office of the department that the infant has been surrendered in the manner described in (c) of this section.

(e) An individual, agency, facility, or entity that receives an infant abandoned safely under (c) of this section is not liable for civil damages for failure to discharge the duties listed in (d) of this section.

(f) A record regarding the surrender of an infant under (c) of this section is confidential and not subject to public inspection or copying under AS 40.25.100§40.25.220.

###### Sec. 47.10.014.   Neglect.

For purposes of this chapter, the court may find neglect of a child if the parent, guardian, or custodian fails to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, education, medical attention, or other care and control necessary for the child's physical and mental health and development, though financially able to do so or offered financial or other reasonable means to do so.

###### Sec. 47.10.015.   Physical harm.

For the purposes of this chapter, the court may find physical harm to a child or substantial risk of physical harm to a child if

(1) the child was the victim of an act described in AS 11.41.100§11.41.250, 11.41.300, 11.41.410§11.41.455, or AS 11.51.100 and the physical harm occurred as a result of conduct by or conditions created by a parent, guardian, or custodian; or

(2) a negligent act or omission by a parent, guardian, or custodian creates a substantial risk of injury to the child.

###### Sec. 47.10.019.   Limitations on determinations.

Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, the court may not find a minor to be a child in need of aid under this chapter solely on the basis that the child's family is poor, lacks adequate housing, or exhibits a lifestyle that is different from the generally accepted lifestyle standard of the community where the family lives. However, this section may not be construed to prevent a court from finding that a child is in need of aid if the child has been subjected to conduct or conditions described in AS 47.10.011§47.10.015.

###### Sec. 47.10.020.   Investigation and petition.

(a) Whenever circumstances subject a child to the jurisdiction of the court under AS 47.10.005§47.10.142, the court shall appoint a competent person or agency to make a preliminary inquiry and report for the information of the court to determine whether the best interests of the child require that further action be taken. The court shall make the appointment on its own motion or at the request of a person or agency having knowledge of the child's circumstances. If, under this subsection, the court appoints a person or agency to make a preliminary inquiry and to report to it, or if the department is conducting an investigation of a report of child abuse or neglect, the court may issue any orders necessary to aid the person, the agency, or the department in its investigation or in making the preliminary inquiry and report. Upon receipt of the report under this subsection, the court may

(1) close the matter without a court hearing;

(2) determine whether the best interests of the child require that further action be taken; or

(3) authorize the person or agency having knowledge of the facts of the case to file with the court a petition setting out the facts.

(b) The petition and all subsequent pleadings shall be styled as follows: "In the matter of ........................, a child under 18 years of age." The petition may be executed upon the petitioner's information and belief and must be verified. It must include the following information:

(1) the name, address, and occupation of the petitioner, together with the petitioner's relationship to the child, and the petitioner's interest in the matter;

(2) the name, age, and address of the child;

(3) a brief statement of the facts that bring the child within this chapter;

(4) the names and addresses of the child's parents;

(5) the tribal affiliation, if known, of the child;

(6) the name and address of the child's guardian or of the person having control or custody of the child.

(c) If the petitioner does not know a fact required in this section, the petitioner shall so state in the petition.

(d)  [Repealed,§55 ch 59 SLA 1996.]

(e) Nothing in this section requires the department to obtain authorization from the court before

(1) conducting an investigation of a report of child abuse or neglect; or

(2) filing a petition.

###### Sec. 47.10.030.   Summons and custody of minor.

(a) After a petition is filed and after further investigation that the court directs, if the person having custody or control of the minor has not appeared voluntarily, the court shall issue a summons that

(1) recites briefly the substance of the petition;

(2) clearly states that at the hearing it is possible that parental rights and responsibilities may be terminated forever and that the minor may at the hearing be committed to the department for possible adoption; and

(3) directs the person having custody or control of the minor to appear personally in court with the minor at the place and at the time set forth in the summons.

(b) In all cases under this chapter, the child, each parent, the tribe, foster parent or other out-of-home care provider, guardian, and guardian ad litem of the child and, subject to (d) and (e) of this section, each grandparent of the child shall be given notice adequate to give actual notice of the proceedings and the possibility of termination of parental rights and responsibilities, taking into account education and language differences that are known or reasonably ascertainable by the petitioner or the department. The notice of the hearing must contain all names by which the child has been identified. Notice shall be given in the manner appropriate under rules of civil procedure for the service of process in a civil action under Alaska law or in any manner the court by order directs. Proof of the giving of the notice shall be filed with the court before the petition is heard. The court may also subpoena the parent of the child, or any other person whose testimony may be necessary at the hearing. A subpoena or other process may be served by a person authorized by law to make the service, and, where personal service cannot be made, the court may direct that service of process be in a manner appropriate under rules of civil procedure for the service of process in a civil action under Alaska law or in any manner the court directs.

(c) If the minor is in such condition or surroundings that the minor's welfare requires the immediate assumption of custody by the court, the court may order, by endorsement upon the summons, that the officer serving the summons shall at once take the minor into custody and make the temporary placement of the minor that the court directs.

(d) Except as provided in (e) of this section, the department shall give advance written notice of all court hearings in a child's case to a grandparent of the child if

(1) the grandparent has contacted the department, provided evidence acceptable to the department of being the child's grandparent, requested notice about the hearings in the child's case, and provided the department with a current mailing address; or

(2) the department is aware that the child has a grandparent and the grandparent's mailing address is on file with the department.

(e) Notwithstanding (d) of this section, the department is not required to give advance notice to a grandparent about hearings in a child's case if the grandparent

(1) has been convicted of a crime in which the child was the victim; or

(2) is prohibited by a court order from having contact with the child.

###### Sec. 47.10.050.   Appointment of guardian ad litem or attorney.

(a) Whenever in the course of proceedings instituted under this chapter it appears to the court that the welfare of a child will be promoted by the appointment of an attorney to represent the child, the court may make the appointment. If it appears to the court that the welfare of a child in the proceeding will be promoted by the appointment of a guardian ad litem, the court shall make the appointment. Appointment of a guardian ad litem or attorney shall be made under the terms of AS 25.24.310.

###### Sec. 47.10.070.   Hearings.

(a) The court may conduct the hearing on the petition in an informal manner. The court shall give notice of the hearing to the department, and it may send a representative to the hearing.

The department and the persons to whom the department must send notice of the hearing are entitled to be heard at the hearing. Except as provided in (c) of this section, and unless prohibited by federal or state law, court order, or court rule, a hearing is open to the public.

(b)  [Repealed,§55 ch 59 SLA 1996.]

(c) Except as provided in (e) of this section, the following hearings in child-in-need-of-aid cases are closed to the public:

(1) the initial court hearing after the filing of a petition to commence the child-in-need-of-aid case;

(2) a hearing following the initial hearing in which a parent, child, or other party to the case is present but has not had an opportunity to obtain legal representation;

(3) a hearing, or a part of a hearing, for which the court issues a written order finding that allowing the hearing, or part of the hearing, to be open to the public would reasonably be expected to

(A) stigmatize or be emotionally damaging to a child;

(B) inhibit a child's testimony in that hearing;

(C) disclose matters otherwise required to be kept confidential by state or federal statute or regulation, court order, or court rule; or

(D) interfere with a criminal investigation or proceeding or a criminal defendant's right to a fair trial in a criminal proceeding; before ruling on a request under this subparagraph, the court shall give notice and an opportunity to be heard to the state or a municipal agency that is assigned to the criminal investigation or to the prosecuting attorney.

(d) If a hearing, or part of a hearing, in a child-in-need-of-aid case is not closed under (c) of this section, the court shall hear in camera any information offered regarding the location, or readily leading to the location, of a parent, child, or other party to the case who is a victim of domestic violence or whose safety or welfare may be endangered by public release of the information. Access to testimony heard in camera under this subsection is limited to the court and authorized court personnel.

(e) The grandparents of the child and an out-of-home care provider may attend hearings that are otherwise closed to the public under (c) of this section. However, the court shall limit the presence of these persons in a hearing closed to the public to the time during which the person's testimony is being given if the court determines that the limitation is necessary under (c)(3) of this section.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a person attending a hearing open to the public may not disclose a name, picture, or other information that would readily lead to the identification of a child who is the subject of the child-in-need-of-aid case. At the beginning of the hearing, the court shall issue an order specifying the restrictions necessary to comply with this subsection. If a person violates the order, the court may impose any appropriate sanction, including contempt and closure of any further hearings to the person.

###### Sec. 47.10.080.   Judgments and orders.

(a) An adjudication hearing shall be completed within 120 days after a finding of probable cause is entered unless the court finds good cause to continue the hearing. When determining whether to grant a continuance for good cause, the court shall take into consideration the age of the child and the potential adverse effect that the delay may have on the child. The court, at the conclusion of the hearing, as the circumstances of the case may require, shall find and enter a judgment that the child is or is not a child in need of aid.

(b)  [Repealed,§55 ch 59 SLA 1996.]

(c) If the court finds that the child is a child in need of aid, the court shall

(1) order the child committed to the department for placement in an appropriate setting for a period of time not to exceed two years or in any event not to extend past the date the child becomes 19 years of age, except that the department, the child, or the child's guardian ad litem may petition for and the court may grant in a hearing

(A) one-year extensions of commitment that do not extend beyond the child's 19th birthday if the extension is in the best interests of the child; and

(B) additional one-year extensions of commitment past 19 years of age that do not extend beyond the person's 21st birthday if the continued state custody is in the best interests of the person and the person consents to it;

(2) order the child released to a parent, adult family member, or guardian of the child or to another suitable person, and, in appropriate cases, order the parent, adult family member, guardian, or other person to provide medical or other care and treatment; if the court releases the child, it shall direct the department to supervise the care and treatment given to the child, but the court may dispense with the department's supervision if the court finds that the adult to whom the child is released will adequately care for the child without supervision; the department's supervision may not exceed two years or in any event extend past the date the child reaches 19 years of age, except that the department or the child's guardian ad litem may petition for and the court may grant in a hearing

(A) one-year extensions of supervision that do not extend beyond the child's 19th birthday if the extensions are in the best interests of the child; and

(B) an additional one-year period of supervision past 19 years of age if the continued supervision is in the best interests of the person and the person consents to it; or

(3) order, under the grounds specified in (o) of this section or AS 47.10.088, the termination of parental rights and responsibilities of one or both parents and commit the child to the custody of the department; the department shall report quarterly to the court and shall demonstrate in its report that the department is making reasonable efforts to find a permanent placement for the child.

For an order made under (c)(1) of this section, the court shall hold a permanency hearing as required by (l) of this section and at least annually thereafter during the continuation of foster care to determine if continued placement, as it is being provided, is in the best interest of the child. The department, the child, and the child's parents, guardian, and guardian ad litem are entitled, when good cause is shown, to a permanency hearing on application. If the application is granted, the court shall afford these persons and their counsel reasonable advance notice and hold a permanency hearing where these persons and their counsel shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard. The persons entitled to notice under AS 47.10.030(b) and the grandparents entitled to notice under AS 47.10.030(d) are entitled to notice of a permanency hearing under this subsection and are also entitled to be heard at the hearing. The child shall be afforded the opportunity to be present and to be heard at the permanency hearing. After the permanency hearing, the court shall make the written findings that are required under (l) of this section. The court shall review an order made under (c)(2) of this section at least annually to determine if continued supervision, as it is being provided, is in the best interest of the child; this review is not considered to be a permanency hearing and is not governed by the provisions of this subsection that relate to permanency hearings.

(A) and when the child should be returned to the parent or guardian;

(B) the child should be placed for adoption or legal guardianship and whether a petition for termination of parental rights should be filed by the department; and

(3) if the court is unable to make a finding required under (2) of this subsection, the court shall hold another hearing within a reasonable period of time;

(4) in addition to the findings required by (2) of this subsection, the court shall also make appropriate written findings related to

(A) whether the department has made the reasonable efforts required under AS 47.10.086 to offer appropriate family support services to remedy the parent's or guardian's conduct or conditions in the home that made the child a child in need of aid under this chapter;

(B) whether the parent or guardian has made substantial progress to remedy the parent's or guardian's conduct or conditions in the home that made the child a child in need of aid under this chapter;

(C) if the permanent plan is for the child to remain in out-of- home care, whether

(i) the child's out-of-home placement continues to be appropriate and in the best interests of the child; and

(ii)  the department is making reasonable efforts to find a permanent placement for the child; and

(7)  in a hearing to review the permanent plan under AS 47.10.111(c) or 47.10.112(c), the court shall make written findings related to whether

(A)  the person who filed the petition or proxy is entitled to placement preference under AS 47.14.100(e) or 25 U.S.C. 1915(a), whichever is applicable; and

(n)  [Repealed,§74 ch 35 SLA 2003.]

(o) For purposes of terminating a parent's parental rights under the standards in (c)(3) of this section, the court may determine that incarceration of the parent is sufficient grounds for determining that a child is a child in need of aid under AS 47.10.011 as a result of parental conduct and that the parental rights of the incarcerated parent should be terminated if the court finds, based on clear and convincing evidence, that

(1) the period of incarceration that the parent is scheduled to serve during the child's minority is significant considering the child's age and the child's need for an adult's care and supervision;

(2) there is not another parent willing and able to care for the child; and

(3) the incarcerated parent has failed to make adequate provisions for care of the child during the period of incarceration that will be during the child's minority.

(p) If a child is removed from the parental home, the department shall provide reasonable visitation between the child and the child's parents, guardian, and family. When determining what constitutes reasonable visitation with a family member, the department shall consider the nature and quality of the relationship that existed between the child and the family member before the child was committed to the custody of the department. The court may require the department to file a visitation plan with the court. The department may deny visitation to the parents, guardian, or family members if there is clear and convincing evidence that visits are not in the child's best interests. If the department denies visitation to a parent or family member of a child, the department shall inform the parent or family member of a reason for the denial and of the parent's or adult family member's right to request a review hearing as an interested person. A parent, adult family member, or guardian who is denied visitation may request a review hearing. A non-party adult family member requesting a review hearing under this subsection is not eligible for publicly appointed legal counsel.

(q) If the court orders a child committed to the department under (c) of this section and the department places the child in licensed foster care, the department shall

(1) provide the foster parent with a copy of

(A) appropriate information held by the department regarding the child to the extent required by AS 47.12.310(b)(2)(H);

(B) all initial, updated, and revised case service plans for the child, court orders relating to the child, and the child's medical, mental, and education reports prepared by or for the department, including reports compiled before the child was placed with the foster parent; and

(C) supplements to the plans, orders, and reports described in (B) of this paragraph;

(2) require the foster parent to

(A) maintain and update records regarding medical, mental, educational, and behavioral services provided to the child;

(B) provide all records described in (A) of this paragraph to the department when the child leaves the foster home placement; and

(C) maintain the confidentiality of records regarding a child placed in the foster home except when disclosure of the records is allowed under regulations of the department or when disclosure is reasonably necessary to ensure continuation of care for the child through appropriate medical, mental, educational, and behavioral services.

(r) If the court orders a child committed to the department under (c) of this section, the court shall order the child's parent or guardian to provide the department with

(1) the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all of the child's medical providers;

(2) the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of mental health providers that have provided services to the child;

(3) the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of schools, preschools, or day care facilities that the child was attending before the child was committed to the department;

(4) a description of special needs of the child, if any; and

(5) the names and locations of relatives who may be willing to have the child placed in their home.

(s) The department may transfer a child, in the child's best interests, from one placement setting to another, and the child, the child's parents or guardian, the child's foster parents or out-of-home caregiver, the child's guardian ad litem, the child's attorney, and the child's tribe are entitled to advance notice of a nonemergency transfer. A party opposed to the proposed transfer may request a hearing and must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the transfer would be contrary to the best interests of the child for the court to deny the transfer. A foster parent or out-of-home caregiver who requests a nonemergency change in placement of the child shall provide the department with reasonable advance notice of the requested change. When the department transfers a child from one out-of-home placement to another, the department shall search for an appropriate placement with an adult family member or a family friend who meets the foster care licensing requirements established by the department. A supervisor at the department shall certify in writing in the case file whether the department has searched for an appropriate placement with an adult family member or family friend. If the department has not complied with the search requirements under this subsection, the supervisor shall work to ensure that the department completes the search in the shortest time feasible.

(t) For a child who is placed in foster care, when the department finds that it is in the best interest of a child and that the foster family will not be placed in undue risk of harm, the department shall require foster parents to provide regular opportunities for visitation with the child by the parents of the child and encourage foster parents to serve as mentors for facilitating family reunification.

(u) A hearing conducted under this section is open to the public unless an exception provided in AS 47.10.070(c) applies to make the hearing closed to the public or unless prohibited by federal or state statute or regulation.

(v) In addition to the extensions of state custody ordered by a court under (c)(1)(A) or (B) of this section, a court may grant in a hearing a resumption of state custody that does not extend beyond a person's 21st birthday if the person

(1) consents to it;

(2) was placed in out-of-home care by the department immediately before being released from state custody and the person was

(A) at least 18 years of age and released to the person's own custody; or

(B) at least 16 years of age and released to the

(i) person's own custody after the disabilities of minority were removed under AS 09.55.590; or

(ii) custody of a parent or guardian because the person refused out-of-home care;

(3) is in need of out-of-home care

(A) to avoid personal harm;

(B) because of the person's severe emotional disturbance, mental disability, physical disability, homelessness, or a combination of those conditions;

(C) because the person is completing an educational or vocational program; or

(D) to otherwise improve the person's successful transition to independent living; and

(4) if requested by the department, agrees to reasonable terms for resuming state custody that may include matters relating to the person's education, attainment of a job or life skills, or other terms found by the court to be reasonable and in the person's best interest.

(w) The court shall recognize a presumption that maintenance of a sibling relationship, including with a sibling who is related by blood, marriage, or adoption through one parent, is in a child's best interest.

(x) In any team-decision meeting the department holds to address the potential or actual transfer of a child from one placement setting to another, the department shall ask the participants for input regarding whether it is in the child's best interest for the child to remain in the child's current school for the remainder of the school term.

(y) If the department transfers a child from one placement setting to another and it is reasonable and in the child's best educational interests, the department shall immediately, and in advance of the transfer if possible, coordinate with the school the child is attending to ensure the child is permitted to attend that school through the end of the school term if the child's new placement is in the same municipality and connected by road to the school. If federal funds and school district transportation funds are not available to pay for the cost of transportation for the child, the department shall pay the costs of transporting the child to school. The department shall work with the family or agency where the child is placed to arrange for transportation. The department shall consult with the school district regarding the child's best interests, but the school district may not override the department's decision to allow a child to remain in the current school through the end of the school term.

###### Sec. 47.10.081.   Predisposition hearing reports.

(a)  [Repealed,§55 ch 59 SLA 1996.]

(b) Before the disposition hearing of a child in need of aid, the department shall submit a predisposition report to aid the court in its selection of a disposition.  This report must include, but is not limited to, the following:

(1) a statement of changes in the child's or parent's behavior, which will aid the court in determining that supervision of the family or placement is no longer necessary;

(2) if removal from the home is recommended, a description of the reasons the child cannot be protected or rehabilitated adequately in the home, including a description of any previous efforts to work with the parents and the child in the home and the parents' attitude toward placement of the child;

(3) a description of the potential harm to the child that may result from removal from the home and any efforts that can be made to minimize such harm; and

(4) any further information that the court may request.

(c) The court shall inform the child, the child's parents and the attorneys representing the parties and the guardian ad litem that the predisposition report will be available to them not less than 10 days before the disposition hearing.

(d) For purposes of this section, "parents" means the natural or adoptive parents, and any legal guardian, relative, or other adult person with whom the child has resided and who has acted as a parent in providing for the child for a continuous period of time before this action.

###### Sec. 47.10.082.   Health and safety of child and other considerations.

In making its dispositional order under AS 47.10.080(c), the court shall keep the health and safety of the child as the court's paramount concern and consider

(1) the best interests of the child;

(2) the ability of the state to take custody and to care for the child to protect the child's best interests under AS 47.10.005§47.10.142; and

(3) the potential harm to the child caused by removal of the child from the home and family environment.

###### Sec. 47.10.083.   Review of orders, requests for extensions.

In a review under AS 47.10.080(f) and in a hearing related to a request for extended commitment or extended supervision under AS 47.10.080(c)(1) or (2), the court shall, in addition to the requirements of those provisions and the requirements of court rules, determine whether a child continues to be a child in need of aid at the time of the review or hearing. The court may not continue or extend state custody or supervision of the child unless the court finds that the child continues to be a child in need of aid except that, if the child is no longer a child in need of aid, the court may establish a specific timetable for gradual reunification of the family and termination of state custody or supervision if the court makes a finding that immediate reunification would be detrimental to the child.

###### Sec. 47.10.084.   Legal custody, guardianship, and residual parental rights and responsibilities.

(a) When a child is committed under AS 47.10.080(c)(1) to the department, released under AS 47.10.080(c)(2) to the child's parents, guardian, or other suitable person, or committed to the department or to a legally appointed guardian of the person of the child under AS 47.10.080(c)(3), a relationship of legal custody exists. This relationship imposes on the department and its authorized agents or the parents, guardian, or other suitable person the responsibility of physical care and control of the child, the determination of where and with whom the child shall live, the right and duty to protect, nurture, train, and discipline the child, the duty of providing the child with food, shelter, education, and medical care, and the right and responsibility to make decisions of financial significance concerning the child. These obligations are subject to any residual parental rights and responsibilities and rights and responsibilities of a guardian if one has been appointed. When a child is committed to the department and the department places the child with the child's parent, the parent has the responsibility to provide and pay for food, shelter, education, and medical care for the child. When parental rights have been terminated, or there are no living parents and no guardian has been appointed, the responsibilities of legal custody include those in (b) and (c) of this section. The department or person having legal custody of the child may delegate any of the responsibilities under this section, except authority to consent to marriage, adoption, and military enlistment may not be delegated. For purposes of this chapter, a person in charge of a placement setting is an agent of the department.

(b) When a guardian is appointed for the child, the court shall specify in its order the rights and responsibilities of the guardian.  The guardian may be removed only by court order. The rights and responsibilities may include, but are not limited to, having the right and responsibility of reasonable visitation, consenting to marriage, consenting to military enlistment, consenting to major medical treatment, obtaining representation for the child in legal actions, and making decisions of legal or financial significance concerning the child.

(c) When there has been transfer of legal custody or appointment of a guardian and parental rights have not been terminated by court decree, the parents shall have residual rights and responsibilities. These residual rights and responsibilities of the parent include, but are not limited to, the right and responsibility of reasonable visitation, consent to adoption, consent to marriage, consent to military enlistment, consent to major medical treatment except in cases of emergency or cases falling under AS 25.20.025, and the responsibility for support, except if by court order any residual right and responsibility has been delegated to a guardian under (b) of this section. In this subsection, "major medical treatment" includes the administration of medication used to treat a mental health disorder.

(d) When the child is placed in foster care, the foster parent has the right and responsibility to use a reasonable and prudent parent standard to make decisions relating to the child. The foster parent may make decisions under (a) or (b) of this section that include decisions relating to the child's participation in age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate activities, including travel, sports, field trips, overnight activities, and extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities. The department shall provide foster parents with training regarding the reasonable and prudent parent standard. In this subsection, "reasonable and prudent parent standard" means a standard characterized by careful and sensible decisions to maintain the health, safety, and best interests of the child while encouraging the emotional and developmental growth of the child.

###### Sec. 47.10.085.   Medical treatment by religious means.

In a case in which the minor's status as a child in need of aid is sought to be based on the need for medical care, the court may, upon consideration of the health of the minor and the fact, if it is a fact, that the minor is being provided treatment by spiritual means through prayer in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination by an accredited practitioner of the church or denomination, dismiss the proceedings and thereby close the matter.  This may be done, in the interests of justice and religious freedom, on the court's own motion or upon the application of a party to the proceedings, at any stage of the proceedings after information is given to the court under AS 47.10.020(a).

###### Sec. 47.10.086.   Reasonable efforts.

(a) Except as provided in (b), (c), and (g) of this section, the department shall make timely, reasonable efforts to provide family support services to the child and to the parents or guardian of the child that are designed to prevent out-of-home placement of the child or to enable the safe return of the child to the family home, when appropriate, if the child is in an out-of-home placement. The department's duty to make reasonable efforts under this subsection includes the duty to

(1) identify family support services that will assist the parent or guardian in remedying the conduct or conditions in the home that made the child a child in need of aid;

(2) actively offer the parent or guardian, and refer the parent or guardian to, the services identified under (1) of this subsection; the department shall refer the parent or guardian to, and distribute to the parent or guardian information on, community-based family support services whenever community- based services are available and desired by the parent or guardian; the information may include the use of a power of attorney under AS 13.26.066 to select an individual to care for the child temporarily; and

(3) document the department's actions that are taken under (1) and (2) of this subsection.

(b) If the court makes a finding at a hearing conducted under AS 47.10.080(l) that a parent or guardian has not sufficiently remedied the parent's or guardian's conduct or the conditions in the home despite reasonable efforts made by the department in accordance with this section, the court may conclude that continuation of reasonable efforts of the type described in (a) of this section are not in the best interests of the child. The department shall then make reasonable efforts to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanent plan and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.

(c) The court may determine that reasonable efforts of the type described in (a) of this section are not required if the court has found by clear and convincing evidence that

(1) the parent or guardian has subjected the child to circumstances that pose a substantial risk to the child's health or safety; these circumstances include abandonment, sexual abuse, torture, chronic mental injury, or chronic physical harm;

(2) the parent or guardian has

(A) committed homicide under AS 11.41.100§11.41.130 of a parent of the child or of a child;

(C) committed an assault that is a felony under AS 11.41.200§11.41.220 and results in serious physical injury to a child; or

(D) committed the conduct described in (A)§(C) of this paragraph that violated a law or ordinance of another jurisdiction having elements similar to an offense described in (A)§(C) of this paragraph;

(3) the parent or guardian has, during the 12 months preceding the permanency hearing, failed to comply with a court order to participate in family support services;

(4) the department has conducted a reasonably diligent search over a time period of at least three months for an unidentified or absent parent and has failed to identify and locate the parent;

(5) the parent or guardian is the sole caregiver of the child and the parent or guardian has a mental illness or mental deficiency of such nature and duration that, according to the statement of a psychologist or physician, the parent or guardian will be incapable of caring for the child without placing the child at substantial risk of physical or mental injury even if the department were to provide family support services to the parent or guardian for 12 months;

(6) the parent or guardian has previously been convicted of a crime involving a child in this state or in another jurisdiction and, after the conviction, the child was returned to the custody of the parent or guardian and later removed because of an additional substantiated report of physical or sexual abuse by the parent or guardian;

(7) a child has suffered substantial physical harm as the result of abusive or neglectful conduct by the parent or guardian or by a person known by the parent or guardian and the parent or guardian knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the child;

(8) the parental rights of the parent have been terminated with respect to another child because of child abuse or neglect, the parent has not remedied the conditions or conduct that led to the termination of parental rights, and the parent has demonstrated an inability to protect the child from substantial harm or the risk of substantial harm;

(9) the child has been removed from the child's home on at least two previous occasions, family support services were offered or provided to the parent or guardian at those times, and the parent or guardian has demonstrated an inability to protect the child from substantial harm or the risk of substantial harm;

(10) the parent or guardian is incarcerated and is unavailable to care for the child during a significant period of the child's minority, considering the child's age and need for care by an adult; or

(11) the parent or guardian

(A) has sexually abused the child or another child of the parent or guardian; or

(B) is registered or required to register as a sex offender or child kidnapper under AS 12.63.

(d) If the court determines under (b) or (c) of this section that reasonable efforts under (a) of this section are not required to be provided,

(1) the court shall hold a permanency hearing for the child within 30 days after the determination; and

(2) the department shall make reasonable efforts to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan, and complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.

(e) The department may develop and implement an alternative permanency plan for the child while the department is also making reasonable efforts to return the child to the child's family under (a) of this section.

(f) In making determinations and reasonable efforts under this section, the primary consideration is the child's best interests.

(g) The department is not required to make reasonable efforts of the type described in (a) of this section if the department took emergency custody of an infant under AS 47.10.142 after the infant was abandoned safely within the meaning of AS 47.10.013(c).

(h) The department shall engage a child who is 14 years of age or older in the development or revision of a case plan, permanency goal, or alternative permanency plan for the child. The department shall also allow the child to select not more than two adults to participate in the development or revision of the plan in addition to the child's foster parents or department employees who are supervising the care of the child. The department may reject an adult selected by the child if the department has good cause to believe that the adult will not act in the best interests of the child. If the department rejects an adult, the child may select another adult. The child may designate one of the adults to be the child's advisor, and the advisor may advocate for the child.

###### Sec. 47.10.087.   Placement in secure residential psychiatric treatment centers.

(a) The court may authorize the department to place a child who is in the custody of the department under AS 47.10.080(c)(1) or (3) or 47.10.142 in a secure residential psychiatric treatment center if the court finds, based on the testimony of a mental health professional, that

(1) the child is gravely disabled or is suffering from mental illness and, as a result, is likely to cause serious harm to the child or to another person;

(2) there is no reasonably available, appropriate, and less restrictive alternative for the child's treatment or that less restrictive alternatives have been tried and have failed; and

(3) there is reason to believe that the child's mental condition could be improved by the course of treatment or would deteriorate if untreated.

(b) A court shall review a placement made under this section at least once every 90 days. The court may authorize the department to continue the placement of the child in a secure residential psychiatric treatment center if the court finds, based on the testimony of a mental health professional, that the conditions or symptoms that resulted in the initial order have not ameliorated to such an extent that the child's needs can be met in a less restrictive setting and that the child's mental condition could be improved by the course of treatment or would deteriorate if untreated.

(c) The department shall transfer a child from a secure residential psychiatric treatment center to another appropriate placement if the mental health professional responsible for the child's treatment determines that the child would no longer benefit from the course of treatment or that the child's treatment needs could be met in a less restrictive setting. The department shall notify the child, the child's parents or guardian, and the child's guardian ad litem of a determination and transfer made under this subsection.

(d) In this section, "likely to cause serious harm" has the meaning given in AS 47.30.915.

###### Sec. 47.10.088.   Involuntary termination of parental rights and responsibilities.

(a) Except as provided in AS 47.10.080(o), the rights and responsibilities of the parent regarding the child may be terminated for purposes of freeing a child for adoption or other permanent placement if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that

(1) the child has been subjected to conduct or conditions described in AS 47.10.011;

(2) the parent

(A) has not remedied the conduct or conditions in the home that place the child at substantial risk of harm; or

(B) has failed, within a reasonable time, to remedy the conduct or conditions in the home that place the child in substantial risk so that returning the child to the parent would place the child at substantial risk of physical or mental injury; and

(3) the department has complied with the provisions of AS 47.10.086 concerning reasonable efforts.

(b) In making a determination under (a)(2) of this section, the court may consider any fact relating to the best interests of the child, including

(1) the likelihood of returning the child to the parent within a reasonable time based on the child's age or needs;

(2) the amount of effort by the parent to remedy the conduct or the conditions in the home;

(3) the harm caused to the child;

(4) the likelihood that the harmful conduct will continue; and

(5) the history of conduct by or conditions created by the parent.

(c) In a proceeding under this chapter involving termination of the parental right of a parent, the court shall consider the best interests of the child.

(d) Except as provided in (e) of this section, the department shall petition for termination of a parent's rights to a child, without making further reasonable efforts, when a child is under the jurisdiction of the court under AS 47.10.010 and 47.10.011, and

(1) the child has been in foster care for at least 15 of the most recent 22 months;

(2) the court has determined that the child is abandoned under AS 47.10.013 and the child is younger than six years of age;

(3) the court has made a finding under AS 47.10.086(b) or a determination under AS 47.10.086(c) that the best interests of the child do not require further reasonable efforts by the department;

(5) a parent has made no effort to remedy the parent's conduct or the conditions in the home by the time of the permanency hearing under AS 47.10.080(l).

(e) If one or more of the conditions listed in (d) of this section are present, the department shall petition for termination of the parental rights to a child unless the department

(1) has documented a compelling reason for determining that filing the petition would not be in the best interests of the child; a compelling reason under this paragraph may include care by a relative for the child; or

(2) is required to make reasonable efforts under AS 47.10.086 and the department has not provided to the parent, consistent with the time period in the department's case plan, the family support services that the department has determined are necessary for the safe return of the child to the home.

(f) A child is considered to have entered foster care under this chapter on the earlier of

(1) the date of the first judicial finding of child abuse or neglect; or

(2) 60 days after the date of removal of the child from the child's home under this chapter.

(g) This section does not preclude the department from filing a petition to terminate the parental rights and responsibilities to a child for other reasons, or at an earlier time than those specified in (d) of this section, if the department determines that filing a petition is in the best interests of the child.

(h) The court may order the termination of parental rights and responsibilities of one or both parents under AS 47.10.080(c)(3) and commit the child to the custody of the department. The rights of one parent may be terminated without affecting the rights of the other parent.

(i) The department shall concurrently identify, recruit, process, and approve a qualified person or family for an adoption whenever a petition to terminate a parent's rights to a child is filed. Before identifying a placement of the child in an adoptive home, the department shall attempt to locate all living adult family members of the child and, if an adult family member expresses an interest in adopting the child, investigate the adult family member's ability to care for the child. The department shall provide to all adult family members of the child located by the department written notice of the adult family members' rights under this chapter and of the procedures necessary to gain custody of the child, but the department's obligation to provide written notice under this subsection does not apply to a parent of the child whose parental rights are being or have been terminated or to an adult family member who is known by the department to be ineligible for a foster care license under AS 47.32 and regulations adopted under AS 47.32. If an adult family member of the child requests that the department approve the adult family member for an adoption, the department shall approve the request unless there is good cause not to approve the adoption. If the court issues an order to terminate under (j) of this section, the department shall report within 30 days on the efforts being made to recruit a permanent placement for the child if a permanent placement was not approved at the time of the trial under (j) of this section. The report must document recruitment efforts made for the child.

(j) No later than six months after the date on which the petition to terminate parental rights is filed, the court before which the petition is pending shall hold a trial on the petition unless the court finds that good cause is shown for a continuance. When determining whether to grant a continuance for good cause, the court shall take into consideration the age of the child and the potential adverse effect that the delay may have on the child. The court shall make written findings when granting a continuance.

(k) The court shall issue an order on the petition to terminate within 90 days after the last day of the trial on the petition to terminate parental rights.

###### Sec. 47.10.089.   Voluntary relinquishment of parental rights and responsibilities.

(a) When a child is committed to the custody of the department under AS 47.10.080(c)(1) or (3) or released under AS 47.10.080(c)(2), the rights of a parent with respect to the child, including parental rights to control the child, to withhold consent to an adoption, or to receive notice of a hearing on a petition for adoption, may be voluntarily relinquished to the department and the relationship of parent and child terminated in a proceeding as provided under this section.

(b) A voluntary relinquishment must be in writing and signed by a parent, regardless of the age of the parent, in the presence of a representative of the department or in the presence of a court of competent jurisdiction with the knowledge and approval of the department. A copy of the signed relinquishment shall be given to the parent.

(c) A voluntary relinquishment may be withdrawn within 10 days after it is signed. The relinquishment is invalid unless the relinquishment contains the right of withdrawal as specified under this subsection.

(d) A parent may retain privileges with respect to the child, including the ability to have future contact, communication, and visitation with the child in a voluntary relinquishment executed under this section. A retained privilege must be in writing and stated with specificity.

(e) Not less than 10 days after a voluntary relinquishment is signed, the court shall enter an order terminating parental rights if the court determines that termination of parental rights under the terms of the relinquishment is in the child's best interest. If a parent has retained one or more privileges under (d) of this section, the court shall incorporate the retained privileges in the termination order with a recommendation that the retained privileges be incorporated in an adoption or legal guardianship decree.

(f) A voluntary relinquishment may not be withdrawn and a termination order may not be vacated on the ground that a retained privilege has been withheld from the relinquishing parent or that the relinquishing parent has been unable, for any reason, to act on a retained privilege, except as provided in Rule 60(b), Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure.

(g) After a termination order is entered, a person who has voluntarily relinquished parental rights under this section may request a review hearing, upon a showing of good cause, to seek enforcement or modification of or to vacate a privilege retained in the termination order. The court may modify, enforce, or vacate the retained privilege if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interest of the child to do so.

(h) After a termination order is entered and before the entry of an adoption or legal guardianship decree, a person who voluntarily relinquished parental rights to a child under this section may request a review hearing, upon a showing of good cause, to vacate the termination order and reinstate parental rights relating to that child. A court shall vacate a termination order if the person shows, by clear and convincing evidence, that reinstatement of parental rights is in the best interest of the child and that the person is rehabilitated and capable of providing the care and guidance that will serve the moral, emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the child.

(i) A person who relinquished parental rights is entitled to the appointment of an attorney if a hearing is requested under (g), (h), or (j) of this section to the same extent as if the parent's rights had not been terminated in a child-in-need-of-aid proceeding.

(j) After a termination order is entered and before the entry of an adoption or legal guardianship decree, a prospective adoptive parent or a guardian of a child who is the subject of the adoption or guardianship decree may request, after providing notice as specified under this subsection, that the court decline to incorporate a privilege retained in a termination order and recommended for incorporation in an adoption or guardianship decree under (e) of this section. The request made under this subsection may only be considered by the court after providing at least 20 days' notice by certified mail to the last known address of the person who has voluntarily relinquished parental rights to the child. The notice under this subsection must describe the request and explain that the recipient of the notice may submit a written statement under penalty of perjury to the court that the recipient either agrees with or opposes the request. The notice must also include the deadline for submitting the statement and the mailing address of the court. The court may decline to incorporate a retained privilege if the person who retained the privilege agrees with the request or if the court finds that it is in the child's best interest.

###### Sec. 47.10.090.   Court records.

(a) The court shall make and keep records of all cases brought before it.

(b)  [Repealed,§55 ch 59 SLA 1996.]

(c) Within 30 days after the date of a child's 18th birthday or, if the court retains jurisdiction of a child past the child's 18th birthday, within 30 days after the date on which the court releases jurisdiction over the child, the court shall order all the court's official records pertaining to that child in a proceeding under this chapter sealed. A person may not use these sealed records unless authorized by order of the court upon a finding of good cause.

(d) The name or picture of a child under the jurisdiction of the court may not be made public in connection with the child's status as a child in need of aid unless authorized by order of the court or unless to implement the permanency plan for a child after all parental rights of custody have been terminated. This subsection does not prohibit the release of aggregate information for statistical or other informational purposes if the identity of any particular person is not revealed by the release.

(e) The court's official records under this chapter may be inspected only with the court's permission and only by persons having a legitimate interest in them. A foster parent is considered to have a legitimate interest in those portions of the court's records relating to a child who is placed by the department with the foster parent or who the department proposes for placement with the foster parent.

###### Sec. 47.10.092.   Disclosure to certain public officials and employees.

(a) Notwithstanding AS 47.10.090 and 47.10.093, a parent or legal guardian of a child subject to a proceeding under AS 47.10.005§47.10.142 may disclose confidential or privileged information about the child or the child's family, including information that has been lawfully obtained from agency or court files, to the governor, the lieutenant governor, a legislator, the ombudsman appointed under AS 24.55, the attorney general, and the commissioner of family and community services, administration, or public safety, or an employee of these persons, for review or use in their official capacities. The Department of Family and Community Services and the Department of Administration shall disclose additional confidential or privileged information, excluding privileged attorney-client information, and make copies of documents available for inspection about the child or the child's family to these state officials or employees for review or use in their official capacities upon request of the official or employee and submission of satisfactory evidence that a parent or legal guardian of the child has requested the state official's assistance in the case as part of the official's duties. A person to whom disclosure is made under this section may not disclose confidential or privileged information about the child or the child's family to a person not authorized to receive it.

(b) The disclosure right under (a) of this section is in addition to, and not in derogation of, the rights of a parent or legal guardian of a minor.

(c) The obligations under (a) of this section remain in effect throughout the period that the child is in the custody of the department, including after the parent's parental rights have been terminated with respect to the child, unless the child's parent or legal guardian who made the disclosure under (a) of this section subsequently files a notice with the Department of Family and Community Services that the assistance of the state official or employee is no longer requested.

The court shall have a summons issued and served upon the parents of the minor, if they can be found, in a manner and within a time before the hearing that the court considers reasonable. The court may determine whether the father, mother, another suitable person, or the department shall have the custody and control of the minor. If the minor is of sufficient age and intelligence to state desires, the court shall consider them.

###### Sec. 47.10.111.   Petition for adoption or guardianship of a child in state custody.

(a) Except as provided under AS 13.26.137(b)(2) and AS 25.23.030(d)(2), if a person seeks adoption or appointment as legal guardian of a child in state custody under this chapter, the court shall hear the adoption or guardianship proceedings as part of the child-in-need-of-aid proceedings relating to the child. A person may initiate proceedings for the adoption or legal guardianship of a child in state custody under this chapter by filing with the court a petition

(1) for adoption that meets the requirements of AS 25.23.080; or

(2) to be appointed legal guardian that meets the requirements of AS 13.26.147.

###### Sec. 47.10.141.   Runaway and missing minors.

(a) Upon receiving a written, telephonic, or other request to locate a minor evading the minor's legal custodian or to locate a minor otherwise missing, a law enforcement agency shall make reasonable efforts to locate the minor and shall immediately complete a missing person's report containing information necessary for the identification of the minor. The report must be submitted to the Alaska Public Safety Information Network, the National Crime Information Center, and the missing persons information clearinghouse in accordance with AS 18.65.

(b) A peace officer shall take into protective custody a minor described in (a) of this section if the minor is not otherwise subject to arrest or detention. Unless (c) of this section applies, when a peace officer takes a minor into protective custody under this subsection,

(1) the peace officer shall

(B) take the minor to a nearby location agreed to by the minor's parent or guardian if the parent or guardian does not consent to return of the minor under (A) of this paragraph and the officer does not have reasonable cause to believe that the minor has experienced physical or sexual abuse in the parent's or guardian's household; or

(C) if disposition of the minor is not made under (A) or (B) of this paragraph, take the minor to

(i) an office specified by the Department of Family and Community Services;

(ii) a program for runaway minors licensed by the department under AS 47.10.310;

(iii) a shelter for runaways that has a permit from the department under AS 47.32 that agrees to shelter the minor;

(iv) a facility or contract agency of the department; or

(v) another suitable location and promptly notify the department if an office specified by the department, a licensed program for runaway minors, a shelter for runaways that will accept the minor, or a facility or contract agency of the department does not exist in the community;

(2) if the peace officer plans to take the minor to an office, program, shelter, or facility under (1)(C) of this subsection, the peace officer shall give the highest priority to taking the minor to an office, program, shelter, or facility that is semi-secure;

(3) a minor under protective custody may not be housed in a jail or other detention facility but may be housed in a semi-secure portion of an office, program, shelter, or other facility under (1)(C) of this subsection;

(4) the peace officer, immediately upon taking a minor into protective custody, shall

(A) advise the minor of available mediation services and of the right to social services under AS 47.10.142(b); and

The description of the minor must include, if known, the minor's full name, date and place of birth, parent's names, and mother's maiden name. If the Department of Public Safety has reason to believe that the minor, whether born in this state or not, has been enrolled in a specific school or school district in the state, the department shall also notify the last known school or school district attended in the state by the missing minor of the disappearance. When a person who was listed as a missing minor is found, the Department of Public Safety shall notify the Bureau of Vital Statistics and any school or school district previously informed of the person's disappearance.

(e) In the absence of gross negligence or intentional misconduct, an office, program, shelter, or facility, or an employee of an office, program, shelter, or facility, to which a minor is taken by a peace officer for semi-secure custody is not subject to civil or criminal liability based on the minor's leaving the office, program, shelter, or facility without permission unless the office, program, shelter, or facility is not in compliance with the department's regulations that set standards for semi-security and the lack of compliance was a material factor in the minor's being able to leave without permission.

(f) If a child, without permission, leaves the semi-secure portion of an office, program, shelter, or facility to which the child was taken by a peace officer under (b)(1)(C) of this section, the office, program, shelter, or facility shall immediately notify the department and the nearest law enforcement agency of the identity of the child and the child's absence.

If the department is unable to obtain a reasonably reliable address for a parent or guardian, the department shall keep a copy of the notice on file and, notwithstanding AS 47.10.093, release the notice to the child's parent or guardian on request of the parent or guardian. If the department files a petition alleging that the child is a child in need of aid, the court shall proceed under AS 47.10.142(d).

(g) If the department files a petition alleging the child is a child in need of aid under AS 47.10.011(5) because the child is habitually absent from home or refuses available care, the child's parent or guardian shall attend each hearing held during the child-in-need-of-aid proceedings unless the court excuses the parent or guardian from attendance for good cause. If the child is found to be a child in need of aid, the court may order that the

(1) child participate in treatment;

(2) parent or guardian personally participate in treatment reasonably available in the parent or guardian's community as specified in a plan set out in the court order; and

(3) child and the parent or guardian comply with other conditions set out in the court order.

(h) If the court orders a minor's parent or guardian to participate in the treatment under (g) of this section, the court may also order the parent or guardian to use available insurance or another resource to cover the treatment, or to pay for the treatment if other coverage is unavailable.

(i) If the parent or guardian fails to attend a hearing as required by the court under (g) of this section, the hearing shall proceed without the presence of the parent.

(j) The court shall issue a written order if the court determines that a minor shall be placed in a juvenile detention facility as a result of violating a court order issued under AS 47.10.080(c)(1) or 47.10.142(f). An order issued under this subsection

(1) must include a finding of probable cause that the minor is a runaway in wilful violation of a court order and identify the court order the minor has violated;

(2) must specify the factual basis for determining that there is reasonable cause to believe that the minor has violated a court order;

(3) must describe how the minor's current situation poses a severe and imminent risk to the minor's life or safety;

(4) must include findings of fact to support a determination that there is not an appropriate, less restrictive alternative to placing the minor in a juvenile detention facility available, with due consideration to the best interests of the minor;

(5) must include a plan for the minor's release from the juvenile detention facility in the least amount of time necessary, not to exceed seven days unless otherwise specified by the court; and

(6) may not be renewed or extended.

(k) In this section,

(1) "law enforcement agency" has the meaning given in AS 12.36.090;

(2) "semi-secure" means operated according to standards that may be established by the department in regulations that are designed to require a level of security that will reasonably ensure that, if a minor leaves without permission, the minor's act of leaving will be immediately noticed;

(3) "temporary secure juvenile holding area" has the meaning given in AS 47.12.990.

###### Sec. 47.10.142.   Emergency custody and temporary placement hearing.

(a) The Department of Family and Community Services may take emergency custody of a child upon discovering any of the following circumstances:

(1) the child has been abandoned as abandonment is described in AS 47.10.013;

(2) the child has been neglected by the child's parents or guardian, as "neglect" is described in AS 47.10.014, and the department determines that immediate removal from the child's surroundings is necessary to protect the child's life or provide immediate necessary medical attention;

(3) the child has been subjected to physical harm by a person responsible for the child's welfare, and the department determines that immediate removal from the child's surroundings is necessary to protect the child's life or that immediate medical attention is necessary; or

(4) the child or a sibling has been sexually abused under circumstances listed in AS 47.10.011(7).

(b) The department shall offer available counseling services to the person having legal custody of a minor described in AS 47.10.141 and to the members of the minor's household if it determines that counseling services would be appropriate in the situation. If, after assessing the situation, offering available counseling services to the legal custodian and the minor's household, and furnishing appropriate social services to the minor, the department considers it necessary, the department may take emergency custody of the minor.

(c) When a child is taken into custody under (a) or (b) of this section or when the department is notified of a child's presence in either a program for runaway children under AS 47.10.300§47.10.390 or a shelter for runaway children under AS 47.10.392§47.10.399, the department shall immediately, and in no event more than 24 hours later unless prevented by lack of communication facilities, notify the parents or the person or persons having custody of the child. If the department determines that continued custody is necessary to protect the child, the department shall notify the court of the emergency custody by filing, within 24 hours after custody was assumed, a petition alleging that the child is a child in need of aid. If the department releases the child within 24 hours after taking the child into custody and does not file a child in need of aid petition, the department shall, within 24 hours after releasing the child, file with the court a report explaining why the child was taken into custody, why the child was released, and to whom the child was released.

(d) The court shall immediately, and in no event more than 48 hours after being notified unless prevented by lack of transportation, hold a temporary custody hearing at which the child, if the child's health permits, and the child's parents or guardian, if they can be found, shall be permitted to be present. If present at the hearing, a parent or guardian of the child may request a continuance of the hearing for the purpose of preparing a response to the allegation that the child is a child in need of aid. The court may grant the request on a showing of good cause for why the parent or guardian is not prepared to respond to the allegation. During a continuance, the child remains in the temporary legal custody of the department, except as otherwise provided in this subsection. At the first hearing under this subsection, regardless of whether a continuance is granted, the court shall make a preliminary determination of whether continued placement in the home of the child's parent or guardian would be contrary to the welfare of the child. If a court determines that continued placement in the home of the child's parent or guardian would not be contrary to the welfare of the child, the court shall return the authority to place the child to the child's parent or guardian pending a temporary custody hearing under (e) of this section.

(e) When the temporary custody hearing is held, the court shall determine whether probable cause exists for believing the child to be a child in need of aid, as defined in AS 47.10.990. If the court finds that probable cause exists, it shall order the child committed to the department for temporary placement, or order the child returned to the custody of the child's parents or guardian, subject to the department's supervision of the child's care and treatment. The court shall inform the child, and the child's parents or guardian if they can be found, of the reasons for finding probable cause, authorizing the child's temporary placement, and, if applicable, finding that continued placement in the home of the child's parents or guardian would be contrary to the welfare of the child. If the court finds no probable cause, it shall order the child returned to the custody of the child's parents or guardian.

(f) When a minor is committed to the department for temporary placement under (e) of this section, the court order shall specify the terms, conditions, and duration of placement. If the court orders the minor returned to the custody of the minor's parents or guardian under (e) of this section after a hearing held on a petition filed under AS 47.10.141(f), the court shall specify the terms and conditions that must be followed by the minor and the minor's parents or guardian. The court shall require the minor to remain in the placement provided by the department and shall clearly state in the order the consequences of violating the order, including detention under AS 47.10.141(c).

(g)  [Repealed,§74 ch 35 SLA 2003.]

(h) Within 12 months after a child is committed to the department under this section, the court shall review the placement plan and actual placement of the child under AS 47.10.080(l).

(i) When the department takes emergency custody of a child under this section or a court orders a child committed to the department for temporary placement under this section, the department shall, to the extent feasible and consistent with the best interests of the child, place the child according to the criteria specified under AS 47.14.100(e). A supervisor at the department shall certify in writing in the case file whether the department has searched for an appropriate placement with an adult family member or family friend. If the department has not complied with the search requirements under this subsection, the supervisor shall work to ensure that the department completes the search in the shortest time feasible if it is consistent with the best interests of the child.

###### Sec. 47.12.040.   Investigation and petition.

(a) Whenever circumstances subject a minor to the jurisdiction of this chapter, the court shall

(1) require in conformance with this section, that, for a minor who is alleged to be a delinquent minor under AS 47.12.020, the department or an entity selected by it shall make a preliminary inquiry to determine if any action is appropriate and may take appropriate action to adjust the matter without a court hearing; the department or an entity selected by it may arrange to interview the minor, the minor's parents or guardian, and any other person having relevant information; at or before the interview, the minor and the minor's parents or guardian, if present, must be advised that any statement may be used against the minor and of the following rights of the minor: to have a parent or guardian present at the interview; to remain silent; to have retained or appointed counsel at all stages of the proceedings, including the initial interview; if a petition is filed, to have an adjudication hearing before a judge or jury with compulsory process to compel the attendance of witnesses; and the opportunity to confront and cross-examine witnesses; if, under this paragraph,

(c) If the petitioner does not know a fact required in this section, the petitioner shall so state in the petition.

###### Sec. 47.12.050.   Notice to and involvement of parent or guardian.

(a) Except as may be otherwise specifically provided, in all cases under this chapter, the minor, each parent of the minor, the foster parent of the minor, and the guardian of the minor are entitled to notice adequate to give actual notice of the proceedings, taking into account education and language differences that are known or reasonably ascertainable by the party giving the notice.

(2) must give the minor's foster parent an opportunity to be heard before the informal adjustment is made;

(3) must include notice that informal action to adjust a matter is not successfully completed unless, among other factors that the department or the entity selected by it considers, as to the victim of the act of the minor that is the basis of the delinquency allegation, the minor pays restitution in the amount set by the department or the entity selected by it or agrees as a term or condition set by the department or the entity selected by it to pay the restitution;

###### Sec. 47.12.065.   Dual sentencing provisions.

(a) The department or the entity selected by it may refer to the appropriate district attorney the circumstances involving a minor who is subject to the provisions of this section because the minor is alleged to have violated a criminal law of the state. Except as provided in (d) of this section, the department or the entity selected by it may make the referral if the minor was 16 years of age or older at the time of the offense, and the offense is

(1) a felony that is a crime against a person and the minor has previously been adjudicated a delinquent under the laws of this state or substantially similar laws of another jurisdiction for a felony offense that is a crime against a person; or

(2) sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree.

(b) If a referral is made under (a) of this section, the district attorney may elect to seek imposition of a dual sentence in the case to further the goal and purposes of this chapter as set out in AS 47.12.010. If the district attorney seeks imposition of a dual sentence, the district attorney shall present the case to the grand jury for indictment. If the grand jury returns an indictment, the district attorney shall file with the court under AS 47.12.040(a) a petition seeking the minor's adjudication as a delinquent.

(c) If the district attorney decides not to seek imposition of a dual sentence under (b) of this section or if the grand jury does not return an indictment, the case shall proceed under the remaining provisions of this chapter.

(d) The department or the entity selected by it may refer to the appropriate district attorney a person who is subject to the jurisdiction of this chapter under AS 47.12.020(b) and who is alleged to have committed a felony or other offense. If the district attorney elects to seek imposition of a dual sentence in the matter, the district attorney shall file notice of that election. If the alleged crime is a misdemeanor, the district attorney shall file a delinquency petition. If the alleged crime is a felony, the district attorney shall follow the procedure set out in (b) of this section.

###### Sec. 47.12.070.   Summons and custody of minor.

After a petition is filed and after further investigation that the court directs, if the minor has not appeared voluntarily, the court shall issue a summons that

(1) recites briefly the substance of the petition;

(2) directs the person having custody or control of the minor to appear personally in court with the minor at the place and at the time set forth in the summons.

###### Sec. 47.12.080.   Release of minor.

A minor who is taken into custody may, in the discretion of the court and upon the written promise of the parent, guardian, or custodian to bring the minor before the court at a time specified by the court, be released to the care and custody of the parent, guardian, or custodian. The minor, if not released, shall be detained as provided by AS 47.12.240. The court may determine whether the father or mother or another person shall have the custody and control of the minor for the duration of the proceedings. If the minor is of sufficient age and intelligence to state desires, the court shall give consideration to the minor's desires.

###### Sec. 47.12.090.   Appointment of attorney or guardian ad litem.

(a) In all proceedings initiated under a petition for delinquency, a minor shall have the right to be represented by counsel and, if indigent, have counsel appointed by the court. The court shall appoint counsel in such cases unless it makes a finding on the record that the minor has made a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel and a parent or guardian with whom the minor resides or resided before the filing of the petition concurs with the waiver. In cases in which it has been alleged that the minor has committed an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult, waiver of counsel may not be accepted unless the court is satisfied that the minor has consulted with an attorney before the waiver of counsel.

(b) Whenever in the course of proceedings instituted under this chapter it appears to the court that the welfare of a minor will be promoted by the appointment of an attorney to represent the minor or an attorney or other person to serve as guardian ad litem, the court may make the appointment. Appointment of a guardian ad litem or attorney shall be made under the terms of AS 25.24.310.

###### Sec. 47.12.100.   Waiver of jurisdiction.

(a) If the court finds at a hearing on a petition that there is probable cause for believing that a minor is delinquent and finds that the minor is not amenable to treatment under this chapter, it shall order the case closed. Subject to the provisions of AS 47.12.105, after a case is closed under this subsection, the minor may be charged, held, transported, released on bail, prosecuted, sentenced, and incarcerated in the same manner as an adult.

(b) A minor is unamenable to treatment under this chapter if the minor probably cannot be rehabilitated by treatment under this chapter before reaching 20 years of age. In determining whether a minor is unamenable to treatment, the court may consider the seriousness of the offense the minor is alleged to have committed, the minor's history of delinquency, the probable cause of the minor's delinquent behavior, and the facilities available to the department for treating the minor.

(c) For purposes of making a determination under this section,

(1) the standard of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence; and

(2) the burden of proof that a minor is not amenable to treatment under this chapter is on the state; however, if the petition filed under AS 47.12.040 seeking to have the court declare a minor a delinquent is based on the minor's alleged commission of an offense that is an unclassified felony or class A felony and that is a crime against a person, the minor

(A) is rebuttably presumed not to be amenable to treatment under this chapter; and

(B) has the burden of proof of showing that the minor is amenable to treatment under this chapter.

###### Sec. 47.12.105.   Detention of minors waived into adult court.

(a) Except as provided in AS 47.12.240, the department, by agreement with the Department of Corrections, shall detain and care for waived minors. The department shall transfer a waived minor to a facility operated by the Department of Corrections when the waived minor reaches 18 years of age.

(b) Except as provided in (c) of this section, a waived minor held in an adult correctional facility for more than four hours to attend court proceedings must be separated by sight and sound from adult offenders.

(c) If there is not an available juvenile detention facility in a community where a trial is being held or if a juvenile facility is inappropriate for a waived minor, the department may request that the court order, in the interest of justice, that a waived minor be held in an adult correctional facility with or without sight and sound separation from adult offenders. In making this decision, the court shall consider

(1) the age of the waived minor;

(2) the physical and mental maturity of the waived minor;

(3) the present mental state of the waived minor, including whether the waived minor presents an imminent risk of harm to self;

(4) the nature and circumstances of the alleged offense;

(5) the waived minor's history of prior delinquent acts;

(6) the relative ability of an available adult or juvenile detention facility to meet the specific needs of the waived minor and protect the safety of the public and other detained minors; and

(7) other relevant factors.

(d) If a court determines under (c) of this section that it is in the interest of justice to permit a waived minor to be held in an adult correctional facility,

(1) the department shall request a hearing not less than once every 30 days to review the determination that the waived minor may be held under the ordered circumstances;

(2) the waived minor may not be held in an adult correctional facility, or permitted to have sight or sound contact with adult offenders, for more than 180 days, unless the court determines in writing that there is good cause for an extension or the waived minor expressly waives this limitation.

(e) A waived minor detained under (a) of this section shall be detained in a secure juvenile facility and receive credit, including a good time deduction under AS 33.20.010, for time spent in a department facility pending trial, sentencing, or appeal, if the detention is in connection with an offense for which a sentence is imposed.

(f) A waived minor who is detained in an adult correctional facility under (c) of this section is entitled to counsel at a review hearing held under (d) of this section.

(g) In this section, "waived minor" means an individual who commits an offense while under the age of 18 and is waived into adult court under AS 47.12.030 or 47.12.100.

###### Sec. 47.12.110.   Hearings.

(a) The court shall conduct a hearing on the petition. The court shall give notice of the hearing to the department, and the department shall send a representative to the hearing. The representative of the department may also be heard at the hearing. The department shall give notice of the hearing and a copy of the petition to the minor's foster parent, and the court shall give the foster parent an opportunity to be heard at the hearing. The public shall be excluded from the hearing, but the court, in its discretion, may permit individuals to attend a hearing if their attendance is compatible with the best interests of the minor. Nothing in this section may be applied in such a way as to deny a minor's rights to confront adverse witnesses, to a public trial, and to a trial by jury.

(b) Notwithstanding (a) of this section or an order prohibiting or limiting the public made under (e) of this section, the victim of an offense that a minor is alleged to have committed, or the designee of the victim, has a right to be present at all hearings or proceedings held under this section at which the minor has a right to be present. If the minor is found to have committed the offense, the victim may at the disposition hearing give sworn testimony or make an unsworn oral presentation concerning the offense and its effect on the victim. If there are numerous victims of a minor's offense, the court may limit the number of victims who may give sworn testimony or make an unsworn oral presentation, but the court may not limit the right of a victim to attend a hearing even if the victim is likely to be a witness in a hearing concerning the minor's alleged offense.

(c)  [Repealed,§54 ch 107 SLA 1998.]

(d) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, a court hearing on a petition seeking the adjudication of a minor as a delinquent shall be open to the public, except as prohibited or limited by order of the court, if

(1) the department files with the court a motion asking the court to open the hearing to the public, and the petition seeking adjudication of the minor as a delinquent is based on

(A) the minor's alleged commission of an offense, and the minor has knowingly failed to comply with all the terms and conditions required of the minor by the department or imposed on the minor in a court order entered under AS 47.12.040(a)(2) or 47.12.120;

(C) the minor's alleged commission of a felony and the minor was 16 years of age or older at the time of commission of the offense when the minor has previously been convicted or adjudicated a delinquent minor based on the minor's commission of an offense that is a felony; or

(2) the minor agrees to a public hearing on the petition seeking adjudication of the minor as a delinquent.

(e) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, a court proceeding shall be open to the public, except as prohibited or limited by order of the court, when the district attorney has elected to seek imposition of a dual sentence and a petition has been filed under AS 47.12.065, or when a minor agrees as part of a plea agreement to be subject to dual sentencing.

(f) During jury selection or as part of an opening statement at the hearing, the attorney representing the department may introduce the victim to the jury, and the attorney for the minor may introduce the minor to the jury.

These obligations are subject to any residual parental rights and responsibilities and rights and responsibilities of a guardian if one has been appointed. When a minor is committed to the department and the department places the minor with the minor's parent, the parent has the responsibility to provide and pay for food, shelter, education, and medical care for the minor.

The department or person having legal custody of the minor may delegate any of the responsibilities under this section, except authority to consent to marriage, adoption, and military enlistment may not be delegated. For purposes of this chapter, a person in charge of a placement setting is an agent of the department.

(b) When a guardian is appointed for the minor, the court shall specify in its order the rights and responsibilities of the guardian. The guardian may be removed only by court order. The rights and responsibilities may include, but are not limited to, having the right and responsibility of reasonable visitation, consenting to marriage, consenting to military enlistment, consenting to major medical treatment, obtaining representation for the minor in legal actions, and making decisions of legal or financial significance concerning the minor.

(c) When there has been transfer of legal custody or appointment of a guardian and parental rights have not been terminated by court decree, the parents shall have residual rights and responsibilities. These residual rights and responsibilities of the parent include the right and responsibility of reasonable visitation, consent to adoption, consent to marriage, consent to military enlistment, consent to major medical treatment except in cases of emergency or cases falling under AS 25.20.025, and the responsibility for support, except if by court order any residual right and responsibility has been delegated to a guardian under (b) of this section.

###### Sec. 47.12.155.   Parental or guardian accountability and participation.

(a) The parent or guardian of a minor who is alleged to be a delinquent under AS 47.12.020 or found to be a delinquent under AS 47.12.120 shall attend each hearing held during the delinquency proceedings unless the court excuses the parent or guardian from attendance for good cause.

(b) If a minor is found to be a delinquent under AS 47.12.120, the court may order that the minor's parent or guardian

(1) personally participate in treatment reasonably available in the parent's or guardian's location as specified in a plan set out in the court order;

(2) notify the department if the minor violates a term or condition of the court order; and

(3) comply with any other conditions set out in the court order, including a condition in an order requiring a parent to pay restitution ordered on behalf of a victim of a delinquent act.

(c) If a court orders a minor's parent or guardian to participate in treatment under (b) of this section, the court also shall order the parent or guardian to use any available insurance or another resource to cover the treatment, or to pay for the treatment if other coverage is unavailable. If the court determines that the parent or guardian is unable to pay for the treatment due to indigence and the department pays for the treatment, the department may seek reimbursement only from the indigent parent's or guardian's permanent fund dividend.

(d) The permanent fund dividend of an indigent parent or guardian participating in treatment ordered under (b) of this section may be taken under AS 43.23.140(b)(6) and 43.23.150 to satisfy the balance due on a reimbursement claim by the department under (c) of this section.

(e) If a parent or guardian fails to attend a hearing as required in (a) of this section, the court shall hold the hearing without the attendance of the parent or guardian.

###### Sec. 47.12.160.   Retention of jurisdiction over minor.

(a) Except as provided in (g) of this section, the court retains jurisdiction over the case and may at any time stay execution, modify, set aside, revoke, or enlarge a judgment or order, or grant a new hearing, in the exercise of its power of protection over the minor and for the minor's best interest, for a period of time not to exceed the maximum period otherwise permitted by law or in any event extend past the day the minor becomes 19, unless sooner discharged by the court, except that the department may apply for and the court may grant an additional one-year period of supervision past age 19 if continued supervision is in the best interests of the person and the person consents to it. An application for any of these purposes may be made by the parent, guardian, or custodian acting in behalf of the minor, or the court may, on its own motion, and after reasonable notice to interested parties and the appropriate department, take action that it considers appropriate.

(b) If the court determines at a hearing authorized by (a) of this section that it is in the best interests of the minor to be released to the care or custody of the minor's parent, guardian, or custodian, it may enter an order to that effect and the minor is discharged from the control of the department.

(c) If a minor is adjudicated a delinquent before the minor's 18th birthday, the court may retain jurisdiction over the minor after the minor's 18th birthday for the purpose of supervising the minor's rehabilitation, but the court's jurisdiction over the minor under this chapter never extends beyond the minor's 19th birthday, except that the department may apply for and the court may grant an additional one-year period of supervision past age 19 if continued supervision is in the best interests of the person and the person consents to it. The department may retain jurisdiction over the person between the person's 18th and 19th birthdays for the purpose of supervising the person's rehabilitation, if the person has been placed under the supervision of the department before the person's 18th birthday, except that the department may apply for and the court may grant an additional one-year period of supervision past age 19 if continued supervision is in the best interests of the person and the person consents to it.

(d) The department, or the district attorney in a matter subject to the jurisdiction of this chapter under AS 47.12.020(b), may petition the court for imposition of sentence pronounced under AS 47.12.120(j)(2) if the offender is still subject to the jurisdiction of the court and if the offender, after pronouncement of sentence under AS 47.12.120(j)(2),

(1) commits a subsequent felony offense;

(2) commits a subsequent offense against a person that is a misdemeanor and involves injury to a person or the use of a deadly weapon;

(3) fails to comply with the terms of a restitution order;

(4) fails to engage in or satisfactorily complete a rehabilitation program ordered by a court or required by a facility or juvenile probation officer; or

(5) escapes from a juvenile or other correctional facility.

(e) If a petition is filed under (d) of this section and if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the minor has committed a subsequent felony offense that is a crime against a person or is the crime of arson, the court shall impose the adult sentence previously pronounced under AS 47.12.120(j) and, subject to AS 47.12.105, transfer custody of the minor to the Department of Corrections. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that any of the other circumstances set out in (d)(1)§(5) of this section exist, the court shall impose the adult sentence previously pronounced and, subject to AS 47.12.105, transfer custody of the minor to the Department of Corrections unless the minor proves by preponderance of the evidence that mitigating circumstances exist that justify a continuance in the stay of the adult sentence and the minor is amenable to further treatment under this chapter. The court shall make written findings to support its order.

(f) Notwithstanding another provision of law, the court shall accept

(1) payments of restitution from a minor and the minor's parent at any time;and

(2) prepayments of restitution or payments in anticipation of an order of restitution.

(g) If the department has filed a delinquency petition under AS 47.12.020 and 47.12.040 regarding a minor who is 18 years of age or older, the court has jurisdiction to adjudicate and dispose of the matter as provided in this chapter.

###### Sec. 47.12.170.   Enforcement of restitution.

(a) An order by the court under AS 47.12.120 that a minor or the minor's parent pay restitution is a civil judgment that remains enforceable after the expiration of the court's jurisdiction over the minor under AS 47.12.160. A recipient of a restitution order, or the state on behalf of the restitution recipient, may enforce a restitution order against the minor and the minor's parent by any procedure authorized by law for enforcement of a civil judgment. If the restitution recipient enforces or collects restitution through civil process, collection costs and full reasonable attorney fees shall be awarded. If the state on the restitution recipient's behalf enforces or collects restitution through civil process, collection costs and full reasonable attorney fees shall be awarded, up to a maximum of twice the amount of restitution owing at the time the civil process was initiated. This section does not limit the authority of the court to otherwise enforce orders of payment for restitution. An order of restitution enforced under this section does not limit under other law the civil liability of the minor or the minor's parent as a result of the delinquent conduct.

(b) The Department of Law is authorized to collect restitution on behalf of the recipient unless

(1) the recipient elects as provided in (c) of this section to enforce the order of restitution without the assistance of the Department of Law; or

(2) the order requires restitution to be made in a form other than payment of a specific dollar amount.

(c) The court shall forward a copy of the restitution order to the department and the office of victims' rights when the order is entered. Upon receipt of the order, the department shall send a notice to the recipient regarding the recipient's rights under this section, including the right to elect to enforce the order of restitution without the assistance of the Department of Law and of the possibility of, and procedure for, receiving payment from the restorative justice account. When 90 days have passed since the recipient received the notice, or when the department receives the recipient's response to the notice, whichever is earlier, the department shall send to the Department of Law a copy of the order of restitution; the name, date of birth, social security number, and current address of the recipient, the minor, and the minor's parent; the notice sent to the recipient under this subsection; and the recipient's response, if any. If a response from the recipient reaches the department after the department has sent the order of restitution and other information to the Department of Law under this subsection, the department shall immediately send the response to the Department of Law. The information provided to the Department of Law and the office of victims' rights under this subsection is confidential and is not open to inspection as a public record under AS 40.25.110. The Department of Law, the office of victims' rights, or agents for the Department of Law or office of victims' rights may not disclose the information except as necessary to collect on the restitution.

(d) The Department of Law may not begin collection procedures on the order of restitution until the recipient has been given notice under (c) of this section and has been given 90 days after receipt of notice to elect to collect the restitution without the assistance of the Department of Law. If the Department of Law receives a response to the notice before the 90-day period, the Department of Law may begin collection on the restitution. A recipient may inform the Department of Law at a later time of the recipient's election to collect the restitution without the assistance of the Department of Law; upon receipt of the information, the Department of Law may no longer proceed with collection efforts on behalf of the recipient. A recipient who has elected under this section to collect restitution without the assistance of the Department of Law may not later request the services of that department to collect the restitution.

(e) If the Department of Law or its agents proceed to collect restitution on behalf of a recipient under (c) of this section, the actions of the Department of Law or an agent of the Department of Law on behalf of the recipient do not create an attorney-client relationship between the Department of Law and the recipient. The Department of Law or its agent may not settle a judgment for restitution without the consent of the recipient of the restitution.

(f) An action for damages may not be brought against the state or any of its agents, officers, or employees based on an action or omission under this section.

(g) The Department of Law may enter into contracts on behalf of the state to carry out the collection procedures of this section. The Department of Law may adopt regulations necessary to carry out the collection procedures of this section, including the reimbursement of attorney fees and costs in appropriate cases.

###### Sec. 47.12.180.   Effect of adjudication.

(a) Except as provided by AS 47.12.160(d) and (e) and AS 47.12.170, an adjudication under this chapter upon the status of a minor

(1) may not operate to impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by conviction upon a criminal charge;

(2) does not operate to permit a minor afterward to be considered a criminal by the adjudication; and

(3) does not operate to permit the adjudication to be afterward considered a conviction, nor may a minor be charged with or convicted of a crime in a court except as provided in this chapter.

(b) The commitment and placement of a minor and evidence given in the court are not admissible as evidence against the minor in a subsequent case or proceedings in any other court, nor does the commitment and placement or evidence operate to disqualify a minor in a future civil service examination or appointment in the state.

###### Sec. 47.12.200.   Arrest of a minor.

The arrest of a minor other than for a traffic offense is not considered an arrest for any purpose except for the purpose of the disposition of a proceeding arising out of that arrest.

###### Sec. 47.12.210.   Fingerprinting of minors.

(a) A peace officer may fingerprint a minor under the same circumstances as an adult may be fingerprinted.

(b) Except as provided by AS 47.12.310(b)(1), fingerprint records taken under this section are not subject to AS 47.12.310.

###### Sec. 47.12.220.   Appointment of guardian or custodian.

When, in the course of a proceeding under this chapter, it appears to the court that the welfare of a minor will be promoted by the appointment of a guardian or custodian of the minor's person or property, the court may make the appointment. The court shall have a summons issued and served upon the parents of the minor, if they can be found, in a manner and within a time before the hearing that the court considers reasonable. The court may determine whether the father, mother, or the department shall have the custody and control of the minor. If the minor is of sufficient age and intelligence to state desires, the court shall consider them. The court may order either or both parents to pay support for the minor's care to the guardian, custodian, or department.

###### Sec. 47.12.230.   Support of minor.

(a) When a delinquent minor is committed under this chapter, the court or the child support services agency created in AS 25.27.010 shall, after giving the parent a reasonable opportunity to be heard, require that the parent pay to the department in a manner that the court or the child support services agency directs a sum to cover in full or in part the maintenance and care of the minor. The support obligation shall be calculated under Rule 90.3(i) of the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure.

(b) If a parent wilfully fails or refuses to pay the sum fixed, the parent may be proceeded against as provided by law in cases of family desertion and nonsupport.

(c) The sum collected from a parent under this section shall be directly credited to the general fund of the state.

###### Sec. 47.12.240.   Detention of minors.

(a) When the court commits a minor to the custody of the department, the department shall arrange to place the minor in a juvenile detention facility or another suitable place that the department designates for that purpose. Except under the conditions described in AS 47.12.105 or (c) of this section, the minor may not be incarcerated in a correctional facility that houses adult prisoners.

(b) When a minor is detained under this chapter, the person having responsibility for the facility in which the minor is detained shall immediately make reasonable attempts to notify the minor's parent, guardian, or custodian of the minor's detention.

(c) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, a minor may be detained in an adult correctional facility, an adult jail, or a temporary secure juvenile holding area if the minor is arrested for criminal charges under AS 47.12.030(a), if the minor is the subject of a petition filed with the court under this chapter seeking adjudication of the minor as a delinquent minor, or if the minor is in official detention pending the filing of that petition; however, detention in an adult correctional facility, an adult jail, or a temporary secure juvenile holding area under this subsection may not exceed the lesser of

(1) six hours, except under the criteria listed in (e) of this section; or

(2) the time necessary to arrange the minor's transportation to a juvenile detention facility or comparable facility for the detention of minors.

(d) When a minor is detained under (c) of this section, the minor shall be

(1) assigned to quarters in a correctional facility or an adult jail that are separate from quarters used to house adult prisoners so that the minor cannot communicate with or view adults who are in official detention;

(2) provided admission, health care, hygiene, and food services and recreation and visitation opportunities separate from services and opportunities provided to adults who are in official detention.

(e) Notwithstanding the limitation on detention set out in (c) of this section, a minor whose detention is authorized by (c) of this section may be detained in a correctional facility for up to 24 hours when the authority having jurisdiction over the minor under this chapter is outside a metropolitan statistical area under the current designation of the United States Bureau of the Census and the authority has no existing acceptable alternative placement available for the minor. The minor may be held in secure custody beyond the 24-hour period if the criteria set out in this subsection are met and if the correctional facility is located where conditions of

(1) distance to be traveled or the lack of highway, road, or other ground transportation do not allow for court appearances within 24 hours, in which case the minor may be held for up to an additional 48 hours at the correctional facility; or

(2) lack of safety exist, such as severely adverse, life-threatening weather conditions that do not allow for reasonably safe travel, in which case the time for an appearance may be delayed until 24 hours after the time that the conditions become safe.

(f) A detention authorized by (e) of this section may not exceed the time necessary to satisfy the requirement of (c)(2) of this section.

(g) [Repealed,§42 ch 12 SLA 2006.]

###### Sec. 47.12.245.   Arrest.

(a) A peace officer may

(1) arrest a minor

(A) for the commission of an act that subjects the minor to the provisions of this chapter under the same circumstances and in the same manner as would apply to the arrest of an adult for violation of a criminal law of the state or a municipality of the state;

(B) if the peace officer reasonably believes the minor is a fugitive from justice;

(C) if the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the minor has violated a condition of the minor's release or probation; or

(D) if the peace officer reasonably believes that the minor has been adjudicated a delinquent and has escaped from an institution or absconded from probation, parole, or the jurisdiction of a court;

(2) continue the lawful arrest of a minor that is made by a citizen.

(b) A juvenile probation officer may arrest a minor if the juvenile probation officer has probable cause to believe that the minor has violated the minor's conditions of conduct or probation.

###### Sec. 47.12.250.   Temporary detention and detention hearing.

(a) A peace officer or a juvenile probation officer who has arrested, or a peace officer who has continued the arrest of, a minor under AS 47.12.245 or a minor for criminal charges under AS 47.12.030 may

(1) have the minor detained in a juvenile detention facility or temporary secure juvenile holding area if, in the opinion of the officer making or continuing the arrest, it is necessary to do so to protect the minor or the community; however, the department may direct that a minor subject to delinquency proceedings who was arrested or whose arrest was continued be released from detention before the hearing required by (c) of this section;

(2) before taking the minor to a juvenile detention facility or temporary secure juvenile holding area, release the minor to the minor's parents or guardian if detention is not necessary to

(A) protect the minor or the community; or

(B) ensure the minor's attendance at subsequent court hearings.

(b) A peace officer who has a minor detained under (a) of this section shall immediately, and in no event more than 12 hours later, notify the court and make reasonable efforts to notify the minor's parents or guardian, the minor's foster parent, and the department of the officer's action. The department may file with the court a petition alleging delinquency before the detention hearing.

(c) The court shall immediately, and in no event more than 48 hours later, hold a hearing at which the minor and the minor's parents or guardian if they can be found shall be present. For those minors held securely in correctional facilities that house adult prisoners, the court shall immediately, and in no event more than 24 hours after the custody begins, hold a hearing at which the minor and the minor's parents or guardian if they can be found shall be present. The court shall determine whether probable cause exists for believing the minor to be delinquent. The court shall inform the minor of the reasons alleged to constitute probable cause and the reasons alleged to authorize the minor's detention. The minor is entitled to counsel. The court shall give the minor's foster parent the opportunity to be heard at the hearing.

(d) If the court finds that probable cause exists, it shall determine whether the minor should be detained pending the hearing on the petition or released. It may either order the minor held in detention or released to the custody of a suitable person pending the hearing on the petition. If the court finds no probable cause, it shall order the minor released and close the case.

(e) Except for temporary detention pending a detention hearing, a minor may be detained only by court order.

(f) A minor arrested for criminal charges under AS 47.12.030 is subject to adult court proceedings and shall be held in a juvenile detention facility under AS 47.12.105. A minor arrested under this section may be temporarily held in an adult correctional facility or temporary secure juvenile holding area under the conditions set out in AS 47.12.240(c).

###### Sec. 47.12.255.   Placement in secure residential psychiatric treatment centers.

(a) The court may authorize the department to place a minor who is in the custody of the department under AS 47.12.120(b)(1) or (3) or 47.12.140 in a secure residential psychiatric treatment center if the court finds, based on the testimony of a mental health professional, that

(1) the minor is gravely disabled or is suffering from mental illness and, as a result, is likely to cause serious harm to the minor or to another person;

(2) there is no reasonably available, appropriate, and less restrictive alternative for the minor's treatment or that less restrictive alternatives have been tried and have failed; and

(3) there is reason to believe that the minor's mental condition could be improved by the course of treatment or would deteriorate if untreated.

(b) A court shall review a placement made under this section at least once every 90 days. The court may authorize the department to continue the placement of the minor in a secure residential psychiatric treatment center if the court finds, based on the testimony of a mental health professional, that the conditions or symptoms that resulted in the initial order have not ameliorated to such an extent that the minor's needs can be met in a less restrictive setting and that the minor's mental condition could be improved by the course of treatment or would deteriorate if untreated.

(c) The department shall transfer a minor from a secure residential psychiatric treatment center to another appropriate placement if the mental health professional responsible for the minor's treatment determines that the minor would no longer benefit from the course of treatment or that the minor's treatment needs could be met in a less restrictive setting. The department shall notify the minor, the minor's parents or guardian, and the minor's guardian ad litem of a determination and transfer made under this subsection.

(d) In this section, "likely to cause serious harm" has the meaning given in AS 47.30.915.

###### Sec. 47.12.260.   Releasing minors after commitment.

A minor found to be a juvenile delinquent who by conduct gives sufficient evidence of having reformed may be released at any time under the conditions and regulations that the department considers proper, if it appears to the satisfaction of the department that there is a reasonable probability that the minor will remain at liberty without violating the law.

###### Sec. 47.12.270.   Juvenile probation officers.

(a) The department shall employ juvenile probation officers. A juvenile probation officer shall exercise the duties of a probation officer and shall prepare preliminary investigations and assist and advise the court in the furtherance of the welfare and control of a minor under the court's jurisdiction. A juvenile probation officer shall also carry out other duties in the care and treatment of minors that are consistent with the intent of this chapter.

(b) A juvenile probation officer has the powers of a peace officer with respect to the service of process and arresting a minor when

(1) a court has issued an arrest warrant;

(2) there is probable cause to believe the minor has violated conditions of conduct or probation; or

(3) probable cause exists for believing that the minor has escaped from or unlawfully evaded a placement made under AS 47.12.120(b)(1).

#### Article 2. Information And Records.

###### Sec. 47.12.300.   Court records.

(a) The court shall make and keep records of all cases brought before it.

(b) The court shall forward a record of adjudication of a violation of an offense listed in AS 28.15.185(a) to the Department of Administration if the court imposes a license revocation under AS 28.15.185.

(c) Except when disclosure of the name of a minor is authorized or required by this chapter and except as provided in (g) of this section, the name or picture of a minor under the jurisdiction of the court may not be made public in connection with the minor's status as a delinquent unless authorized by order of the court.

(d) Except as provided in (f) of this section, within 30 days of the date of a minor's 18th birthday or, if the court retains jurisdiction of a minor past the minor's 18th birthday, within 30 days of the date on which the court releases jurisdiction over the minor, the court shall order all the court's official records pertaining to that minor in a proceeding under this chapter sealed, as well as records of all driver's license proceedings under AS 28.15.185, criminal proceedings against the minor, and punishments assessed against the minor. A person may not use these sealed records for any purpose except that the court may order their use for good cause shown or may order their use by an officer of the court in making a presentencing report for the court. The provisions of this subsection relating to the sealing of records do not apply to records of traffic offenses.

(e) The court's official records prepared under this chapter and not made public under this section are confidential and may be inspected only with the court's permission and only by persons having a legitimate interest in them. A foster parent is considered to have a legitimate interest in those portions of the court's official records relating to a child who is already placed with the foster parent or who is recommended for placement with the foster parent. A person with a legitimate interest in the inspection of a confidential record maintained by the court also includes a victim who suffered physical injury or whose real or personal property was damaged as a result of an offense that was the basis of an adjudication or modification of disposition. If the victim knows the identity of the minor, identifies the minor or the offense to the court, and certifies that the information is being sought to consider or support a civil action against the minor or against the minor's parents or guardian under AS 09.65.255, the court shall, subject to AS 12.61.110 and 12.61.140, allow the victim to inspect and use the following records and information in connection with the civil action:

(1) a petition filed under AS 47.12.040(a) seeking to have the court declare the minor a delinquent;

(2) a petition filed under AS 47.12.120 seeking to have the court modify or revoke the minor's probation;

(3) a petition filed under AS 47.12.100 requesting the court to find that a minor is not amenable to treatment under this chapter and that results in closure of a case under AS 47.12.100(a); and

(4) a court judgment or order entered under this chapter that disposes of a petition identified in (1)§(3) of this subsection.

(f) A person who has been tried as an adult under AS 47.12.100(a) or a person whose records have been made public under (g) of this section, or the department on the person's behalf, may petition the superior court to seal the records of all criminal proceedings, except traffic offenses, initiated against the person, and all punishments assessed against the person, while the person was a minor. A petition under this subsection may not be filed until five years after the completion of the sentence imposed for the offense for which the person was tried as an adult or five years after a disposition was entered for an offense for which the records were made public under (g) of this section. If the superior court finds that its order has had its intended rehabilitative effect and further finds that the person has fulfilled all orders of the court entered under AS 47.12.120, the superior court shall order the record of proceedings and the record of punishments sealed. Sealing the records restores civil rights removed because of a conviction. A person may not use these sealed records for any purpose except that the court may order their use for good cause shown or may order their use by an officer of the court in making a presentencing report for the court. The court may not, under this subsection, seal records of a criminal proceeding

(1) initiated against a person if the court finds that the person has not complied with a court order made under AS 47.12.120; or

(2) commenced under AS 47.12.030(a) unless the minor has been acquitted of all offenses with which the minor was charged or unless the most serious offense of which the minor was convicted was not an offense specified in AS 47.12.030(a).

(g) When a district attorney has elected to seek imposition of a dual sentence and a petition has been filed under AS 47.12.065, or when a minor agrees as part of a plea agreement to be subject to dual sentencing, all court records shall be open to the public except for predisposition reports, psychiatric and psychological reports, and other documents that the court orders to be kept confidential because the release of the documents could be harmful to the minor or could violate the constitutional rights of the victim or other persons.

(h) Except as provided in (f) of this section, this section does not apply to the records of a minor who is waived into adult court under AS 47.12.030 or 47.12.100 and is subject to this chapter only to the extent that AS 47.12.105 applies to the minor.

(i) A person who discloses confidential information in violation of this section is guilty of a class B misdemeanor.

###### Sec. 47.12.310.   Agency records.

(a) Except as specified in AS 47.12.315, 47.12.320, and (b)§(g) and (i) of this section, all information and social records pertaining to a minor who is subject to this chapter or AS 47.17 prepared by or in the possession of a federal, state, or municipal agency or employee in the discharge of the agency's or employee's official duty, including driver's license actions under AS 28.15.185, are privileged and may not be disclosed directly or indirectly to anyone without a court order.

(b) A state or municipal agency or employee shall disclose

(1) information regarding a case to a federal, state, or municipal law enforcement agency for a specific investigation being conducted by that agency;

(2) appropriate information regarding a case to

(A) a guardian ad litem appointed by the court;

(B) a person or an agency requested by the department or the minor's legal custodian to provide consultation or services for a minor who is subject to the jurisdiction of the court under this chapter as necessary to enable the provision of the consultation or services;

(C) school officials as may be necessary to protect the safety of the minor who is the subject of the case and the safety of school students and staff or to enable the school to provide appropriate counseling and supportive services to meet the needs of a minor about whom information is disclosed;

(D) a governmental agency as may be necessary to obtain that agency's assistance for the department in its investigation or to obtain physical custody of a minor;

(E) a law enforcement or corrections agency of this state or another jurisdiction as may be necessary for the protection, rehabilitation, care, or supervision of any minor or for actions by that agency to protect the public safety;

The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to

(8) ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;

(9) establish procedures to resolve pending charges, including detainers, against juvenile offenders before transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;

(10) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;

(11) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;

(12) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and

(13) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise; it is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created in this section are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business; furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact.

## Chapter 17. Child Protection.

###### Sec. 47.17.010.   Purpose.

To protect children whose health and well-being may be adversely affected through the infliction, by other than accidental means, of harm through physical injury or neglect, mental injury, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or maltreatment, the legislature requires the reporting of these cases by practitioners of the healing arts and others to the department. It is not the intent of the legislature that persons required to report suspected child abuse or neglect under this chapter investigate the suspected child abuse or neglect before they make the required report to the department. Reports must be made when there is a reasonable cause to suspect child abuse or neglect in order to make state investigative and social services available in a wider range of cases at an earlier point in time, to make sure that investigations regarding child abuse and neglect are conducted by trained investigators, and to avoid subjecting a child to duplicative interviews about the abuse or neglect. It is the intent of the legislature that, as a result of these reports, protective services will be made available in an effort to

(1) prevent further harm to the child;

(2) safeguard and enhance the general well-being of children in this state; and

(3) preserve family life unless that effort is likely to result in physical or emotional damage to the child.

###### Sec. 47.17.020.   Persons required to report.

(a) The following persons who, in the performance of their occupational duties, their appointed duties under (8) of this subsection, or their volunteer duties under (9) of this subsection, have reasonable cause to suspect that a child has suffered harm as a result of child abuse or neglect shall immediately report the harm to the nearest office of the department and, if the harm appears to be a result of a suspected sex offense, shall immediately report the harm to the nearest law enforcement agency:

(1) practitioners of the healing arts;

(2) school teachers and school administrative staff members, including athletic coaches, of public and private schools;

(3) peace officers and officers of the Department of Corrections;

(4) administrative officers of institutions;

(5) child care providers;

(6) paid employees of domestic violence and sexual assault programs, and crisis intervention and prevention programs as defined in AS 18.66.990;

(7) paid employees of an organization that provides counseling or treatment to individuals seeking to control their use of drugs or alcohol;

(8) members of a child fatality review team established under AS 12.65.015(e) or 12.65.120 or the multidisciplinary child protection team created under AS 47.14.300;

(9) volunteers who interact with children in a public or private school for more than four hours a week;

(10)  juvenile probation officers, juvenile probation office staff, and staff of juvenile detention facilities and juvenile treatment facilities, as those terms are defined in AS 47.12.990.

(b) This section does not prohibit the named persons from reporting cases that have come to their attention in their nonoccupational capacities, nor does it prohibit any other person from reporting a child's harm that the person has reasonable cause to suspect is a result of child abuse or neglect. These reports shall be made to the nearest office of the department.

(c) If the person making a report of harm under this section cannot reasonably contact the nearest office of the department and immediate action is necessary for the well-being of the child, the person shall make the report to a peace officer. The peace officer shall immediately take action to protect the child and shall, at the earliest opportunity, notify the nearest office of the department.

(d) This section does not require a religious healing practitioner to report as neglect of a child the failure to provide medical attention to the child if the child is provided treatment solely by spiritual means through prayer in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination by an accredited practitioner of the church or denomination.

(e) The department shall immediately notify the nearest law enforcement agency if the department

(1) concludes that the harm was caused by a person who is not responsible for the child's welfare;

(2) is unable to determine

(A) who caused the harm to the child; or

(B) whether the person who is believed to have caused the harm has responsibility for the child's welfare; or

(3) concludes that the report involves

(1) the vulnerable adult's spouse, unless the vulnerable adult or the spouse have initiated divorce, dissolution, or legal separation proceedings;

(2) as a group may serve as the surrogate decision maker and reach decisions by consensus.

(d) The department may not continue to provide protective services to a vulnerable adult based on the consent of a surrogate decision maker serving under this section or AS 13.52.030 if the department determines that the vulnerable adult has become able to consent or has regained decision making capacity since the surrogate's consent was given.

However, if circumstances beyond the control of the department or the department's designee make it impossible to provide the protective services within the 10 working days, the department shall ensure that the services are provided as soon as possible after that time.

(b) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, if the department determines that an emergency situation exists that necessitates provision of protective services to a vulnerable adult, the department may provide the necessary protective services in a manner determined by the department to be the most appropriate in light of the emergency situation, regardless of whether the vulnerable adult or any other person has consented to receipt of the services.

(c) To the extent practicable, protective services provided under this section shall be delivered in a culturally relevant manner that protects the vulnerable adult's right to the least restrictive environment and maximizes that person's own decision making capabilities.

(d) If the protective services under this section include the placement of a vulnerable adult in an assisted living home at the state's expense, the minimum daily reimbursement rate to the assisted living home for the vulnerable adult is $70. The department may, under its regulations, provide for a daily rate higher than $70 if the additional care provided to the vulnerable adult in the assisted living home justifies the additional reimbursement. In this subsection, "assisted living home" means an assisted living home licensed under AS 47.32.

(b) If, after an investigation under AS 47.24.015, the department has reasonable cause to believe that a vulnerable adult is mentally ill and as a result either is likely to cause serious harm to self or others or is gravely disabled, the department may petition the court under AS 47.30.700 to initiate an involuntary commitment proceeding.

(c) If a vulnerable adult who has consented to receive protective services, or on whose behalf consent to receive protective services has been given, is prevented by any person from receiving those services, the department may petition the superior court for an injunction restraining the person from interfering with the provision of protective services to the vulnerable adult.

Upon review, the department may, after having provided opportunity for a hearing under (c) of this section, change the assistance granted or terminate it entirely if it finds that the circumstances are changed sufficiently to warrant this action.

The department shall continue the payment of benefits pending the hearing. The state has a claim against a person who received an improper amount of assistance.  The claim may be enforced by an action instituted in the name of the state by the attorney general to recover the amount paid to the person, with interest, together with the necessary costs of the action.

If the department rejects the recommended decision, the department shall independently review the record and issue its final decision. The final decision of the department on the matter is appealable to the courts of this state.

(b) On the application, each applicant shall attest to whether the family, at any time, has received cash assistance or self-sufficiency services from another state program that was established with federal money under the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and whether the family has ever been disqualified from receiving cash assistance or self-sufficiency services under the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program for the period for which the application has been submitted.

(c) An applicant shall agree to cooperate with the department to establish a family self-sufficiency plan and to participate in work activities when assigned by the department.

(e) An applicant shall update the information requested in the application at regular intervals as established by the department in regulation. The department may conduct reviews of an application and audit the information provided as necessary to determine eligibility.

###### Sec. 47.27.025.   Cash assistance.

(a) The department shall provide cash assistance to families that establish eligibility based on a determination of need that considers the family's available income, assets, and other resources, as established by the department in regulation. Each dependent child in the family is eligible for cash assistance except as otherwise provided in AS 47.27.015 or 47.27.027(b), and cash assistance received as a dependent child does not count against eligibility for cash assistance under this chapter as a caretaker or spouse of a caretaker of a dependent child or as a pregnant woman.

(b) The amounts of cash assistance may not exceed the following:

(1) for a dependent child living with a nonneedy relative caretaker, $452 per month, plus $102 for each additional child;

(2) for a dependent child living with at least one needy parent or relative caretaker, $821 per month, plus $102 for each additional child and $102 for a second needy parent if the second parent is physically or mentally unable to perform gainful activity as defined by department regulation; or

(3) for a family consisting solely of an eligible pregnant woman, $514 per month.

(c) The department shall, for the months of July, August, and September, reduce by 50 percent the maximum cash assistance for which the family is otherwise eligible if the family's eligibility for cash assistance is based on AS 47.27.010(4), unless the second needy parent is determined, under regulations of the department, to be physically or mentally unable to perform gainful activity or to be providing care for a child who is experiencing a disability that requires 24-hour care, as certified by a physician or other licensed medical professional. However, if the commissioner determines that temporary economic conditions have resulted in decreased employment opportunities during those months and a reduction in cash assistance would impose an undue hardship on a family, the department may waive application of this subsection with respect to that family.

(d) The department shall reduce cash assistance under this section to the extent that the family's shelter costs are lower than the standard shelter allowance used by the department for similar families. The shelter allowance for a family whose costs are below the standard allowance shall be an amount equal to the family's actual verified shelter costs. In this subsection,

(1) "shelter allowance" means the portion of the cash assistance provided under this section that is allocated by the department for shelter costs;

(2) "shelter costs" means

(A) rental payments or mortgage payments for the family's housing, including payments made for property or mortgage insurance and property taxes; and

(B) the cost of utilities, including heat, electricity, basic telephone service, water, sewer, and garbage services incurred for the family's housing; the department may establish different utility cost standards for different areas of the state and may use an average utility cost per month based on estimated level payments over a 12-month period.

(e) The department may, instead of paying all of the cash assistance to a family under this section, use all or part of the cash assistance as a wage subsidy paid to an employer who employs a person in the family at a wage that is higher than the wage subsidy. If authorized under AS 47.25.975(b), the department may, instead of paying all of a family's food stamp allotment under AS 47.25.975§47.25.990 in a form restricted to buying food, use all or part of the value of the family's food stamp allotment as a wage subsidy paid to an employer who employs a person in the family at a wage that is higher than the total of the wage subsidies paid under this subsection for employment of the person. A subsidy under this subsection may not exceed one year in duration.

###### Sec. 47.27.026.   Diversion payments.

(a) The department may offer a lump-sum diversion payment in place of ongoing cash assistance to an adult applicant who applies under AS 47.27.020 if the adult applicant is job ready and is determined to need only short-term financial assistance and self-sufficiency services to meet critical needs in order to secure employment and support for the adult applicant's family. The department shall set standards and conditions for diversion payments and self-sufficiency services by regulation.

(b) The department may pay a diversion payment to an applicant's family only if that family appears to be eligible for cash assistance under AS 47.27.020 and to include a job-ready individual based on the information provided to the department in the application completed under AS 47.27.020. The department may offer to an applicant with the potential to participate in the diversion project a choice between

(1) having the Alaska temporary assistance program application processed under AS 47.27.020 and the regulations adopted by the department; or

(2) having the application referred to the diversion project of the Alaska temporary assistance program for a determination of eligibility for a diversion project payment and self-sufficiency services under this section.

(c) The amount of a diversion payment with self-sufficiency services must be sufficient to meet the family's immediate needs as determined by the department and the participant. A diversion payment may not exceed the amount the family would be eligible to receive as cash assistance in the first three months of eligibility under AS 47.27.025 if the family did not elect to receive a diversion payment.

(d) As a condition of a family receiving a diversion payment under this section, the participant must sign an agreement that

(1) specifies

(A) the amount of the diversion payment and the needs it is intended to cover;

(B) the self-sufficiency services required to meet the family's immediate needs;

(2) provides that, during the three-month period beginning with the month in which the diversion payment was received, child support collected on behalf of a child whose needs were considered in determining the diversion payment shall be paid to the family; and

(3) provides that if the family reapplies under AS 47.27.020 during the three months beginning with the month in which the family received a diversion payment, the diversion payment shall be treated as unearned income, prorated over the three-month period, and deducted from any cash assistance that the family may be eligible for under the new application.

(e) A family that receives a diversion payment may not receive another diversion payment before the 12th month following the month in which it last received a diversion payment. A family may not receive more than four diversion payments.

(f) To the extent that (d)(2) of this section is inconsistent with AS 25.27.120 or 25.27.130, or with another provision of this chapter, (d)(2) of this section governs.

###### Sec. 47.27.027.   Assistance to minors.

(a) If an applicant under AS 47.27.020 is not married, is under the age of 18, and has not been previously emancipated under AS 09.55.590, the applicant must

(1) live in a home maintained by the applicant's parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative, unless the applicant establishes that there is good cause, as established by the department in regulation, to waive this requirement; if the department waives this requirement, the applicant must live in an approved, adult-supervised, supportive living environment;

(2) agree that cash assistance on behalf of the applicant's family may be paid to the applicant's parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative, or, if applicable, to the adult head of the adult-supervised, supportive living environment in which the applicant resides; and

(3) maintain attendance in a secondary school or other appropriate training program unless the applicant has a high school diploma or general equivalent diploma.

(b) The department shall reduce the cash assistance for which an assistance unit is otherwise eligible under this chapter if a minor parent in the assistance unit fails, without good cause, to meet standards of adequate levels of school attendance, as defined in regulations of the department. The reduction under this subsection shall be achieved by disregarding the needs of the person who failed to meet the school attendance standards. The person's needs shall be disregarded until the minor parent complies.

###### Sec. 47.27.030.   Family self-sufficiency services.

(a) A participant in the Alaska temporary assistance program shall cooperate with the department, or its designee, to develop and sign a family self-sufficiency plan that includes

(3) specific benchmarks to indicate the steps toward successful completion of the family plan;

If a family receives only self-sufficiency services, the department may waive the self-sufficiency plan requirements specified in (a) and (b) of this section.

###### Sec. 47.27.035.   Participation in work activities.

(a) An Alaska temporary assistance program participant shall, after the participant's family has received a cumulative total of 24 months of cash assistance or sooner if assigned to do so by the department, participate in work activities as assigned by the department or its designee in order for the family to continue to receive cash assistance or self-sufficiency services from the department under the Alaska temporary assistance program, unless the participant is exempt from the work participation requirements under one or more of the exemptions set out in (b)§(d) of this section.

###### Sec. 47.27.040.   Assignment of support rights; cooperation with child support services agency.

(a) An Alaska temporary assistance program applicant is considered to have assigned to the state, through the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue, all rights to accrued and continuing child support, from all sources, that is due for the support of any individuals in the family for whom support is sought.

The Department of Health shall establish whether the participant has good cause for refusing to cooperate.

(c) The department may distribute to an Alaska temporary assistance program participant $50 per month from a monthly child support payment, or the amount of the child support payment if it is less than $50, received by the child support services agency for the support of a child for whom Alaska temporary assistance program cash assistance is paid.

The reduction shall be,

(1) beginning on the date the department makes a finding that the family is not in compliance under this subsection, 40 percent of the maximum cash assistance that would be payable under AS 47.27.025 for a family of the same size, assuming the family has no income counted for purposes of this chapter, until the date the department determines that the family is in compliance under this subsection if the family comes into compliance within the first four months after the date of the department's finding of noncompliance under this subsection; on the date the department determines that the family is in compliance, the department shall begin to pay the family the full amount of cash assistance for which the family is eligible;

(2) beginning five months after the date the department made the finding that the family was not in compliance under this subsection, 75 percent of the maximum cash assistance that would be payable under AS 47.27.025 for a family of the same size, assuming the family has no income counted for purposes of this chapter, until the date the department determines that the family is in compliance under this subsection if the family comes into compliance during the fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth month after the date the department initially determined that the family was not in compliance under this subsection; on the date the department determines that the family is in compliance, the department shall begin to pay the family the full amount of cash assistance for which the family is eligible;

(3) beginning nine months after the date the department made the finding that the family was not in compliance under this subsection, the full amount of the family's cash assistance if the noncompliance under this subsection is not corrected within eight months after the date of the department's initial finding of noncompliance under this subsection; in order to again receive cash assistance under this chapter, the family shall reapply under AS 47.27.020 and satisfy all requirements applicable to applicants under that section.

(b) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, the department may not reduce a family's cash assistance under (a)(2) or (3) of this section unless there is, in the family's case record, (1) documented evidence that the department has attempted to visit the family's home after the imposition of a reduction under (a)(1) of this section and (2) a written finding by the department that, considering the results of any home visit attempted under (1) of this subsection and the availability of other services in the community that are appropriate to the family's needs, the health, safety, and well-being of the children in the family will not be significantly jeopardized by imposition of a reduction under (a)(2) or (3) of this section. If the department does not reduce a family's cash assistance based on the provisions of this subsection, the department may manage the family's cash assistance on behalf of the family under regulations that the department shall adopt concerning management of cash assistance under this subsection.

(a) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this chapter, and in addition to grants awarded under AS 47.27.050, the Department of Health may award and administer Alaska Native family assistance grants in accordance with this section. Unless specified otherwise in this section, the provisions of AS 47.27.010§47.27.085 do not apply to grants under this section or to an Alaska Native family assistance program operated under such a grant. To be awarded a grant under this section, an applicant shall

(1) meet the requirements of AS 47.27.070;

(2) have received approval for, and have agreed to operate, a federally approved tribal family assistance plan in this state;

(3) agree to operate the plan approved under this section on a state fiscal year basis; and

(4) meet the other requirements of this section.

(b) If an organization intends to apply for a grant under this section, the organization shall first submit to the department a letter of intent along with a copy of the proposed federal tribal family assistance plan that will be submitted to the federal government for approval. The organization shall make its submission to the department at least six months before the proposed effective date of the federal tribal family assistance plan. The department shall review the submission and notify the organization of significant deficiencies that would make the organization ineligible to be considered for an Alaska Native family assistance grant without significant changes to the federal tribal family assistance plan regardless of whether federal approval is received or whether federal grant money is awarded for implementation of that plan. The organization may make a supplemental submission to the department to resolve deficiencies noted by the department. If, after departmental review and supplemental revision, an organization's plan remains eligible for consideration for a grant award under this section, the department shall notify the organization that the organization may submit a proposal for a grant award after the organization has received notice of federal approval of the federal tribal family assistance plan and the pending award of federal grant money. The commissioner may waive the time deadline specified in this subsection if the commissioner

(1) enters into a joint planning agreement between the department and the organization; or

(2) finds good cause and the waiver is in the state's best interest.

(c) If the department awards a grant under this section, the grant must be in an amount that

(1) for the first fiscal year under the plan accepted by the department, represents a fair and equitable portion of the state appropriations for the state public assistance program administered under this chapter intended to serve the state residents who will be served by the plan; and

(2) for the second and subsequent state fiscal years under the plan accepted by the department, represents a fair and equitable portion of state appropriations made for public assistance programs that is allocated for Alaska Native family assistance grants to be awarded under this section in order to serve the state residents who will be served by the plan; if the money is not allocated for these grants, the amounts shall be made in the same manner as described in (1) of this subsection.

(d) For an organization to be eligible to be awarded a grant under this section, the organization's proposal must include

(1) documentation that the organization

(A) has received federal approval of its federal tribal family assistance plan to operate a tribal assistance program in this state; and

(B) will receive a grant directly from the federal government to implement the federal tribal family assistance plan;

(2) a plan for operation of the Alaska Native family assistance grant that meets the requirements of (e) of this section; and

(3) if the commissioner determines that a federally approved tribal family assistance plan would be a cost-effective and efficient means of administering the program established in this chapter in that region of the state and the needs of state public assistance recipients receiving assistance under this chapter can be met through a contract awarded under AS 47.27.300, the organization's agreement to enter into a contract with the department to provide state public assistance to those eligible state residents in the region who are not included in the population to be served by the federally approved tribal family assistance plan.

(e) An organization's plan for operation of the Alaska Native family assistance grant must

(1) be designed to facilitate self-sufficiency of assistance recipients in the region specified in the federally approved tribal family assistance plan by addressing the conditions specific to that region;

(2) provide for a reasonable pattern of service delivery from all providers serving that region;

(3) serve a specified region that consists of a geographically cohesive group of communities that share similar interests, resources, and traditions;

(4) establish the same maximum number of months of benefits as is established for the state program under AS 47.27.015(a)(1); and

(A) only families with at least one dependent child or a woman in the last trimester of pregnancy are eligible for assistance paid from an Alaska Native family assistance grant;

(B) amounts for assistance provided from an Alaska Native family assistance grant to eligible families may not exceed the amounts specified under AS 47.27.025(b) when combined with assistance provided under the federally approved tribal family assistance grant;

(C) to remain eligible for assistance paid from an Alaska Native family assistance grant, a minor parent of a dependent child must meet the requirements of AS 47.27.027;

(D) families receiving assistance paid from an Alaska Native family assistance grant shall comply with the provisions of AS 47.27.035(a) regarding participation in work activities;

(E) families receiving assistance paid from Alaska Native family assistance grant money shall comply with the provisions of (l)§(n) of this section regarding assignment of support rights and cooperation with the child support services agency;

(F) the organization has an impartial appeals process to allow affected families in the region of the state covered by the plan accepted by the department to have a fair hearing.

(f) The department may award a grant under this section only if the department determines that the proposal, including a plan for operation of the grant, meets the criteria specified in (d) and (e) of this section and that an award of the grant to the organization would be in the public interest. The grant agreement must state that the Alaska Native family assistance program will require all program participants to assign child support rights to the Alaska Native family assistance program unless the Alaska Native organization elects to require participants to assign those child support rights to the state. The department may not distribute grant money until a grant agreement between the organization and the department is executed that meets the requirements of this section.

(g) Records pertaining to recipients of assistance from an Alaska Native family assistance grant awarded under this section are confidential public assistance records under AS 47.05.020 and regulations adopted under AS 47.05.020. Use and misuse of these records are subject to the provisions of AS 47.05.030. It is an official purpose under AS 47.05.020 for an organization receiving a grant under this section and the department or another agency of the state to exchange information concerning recipients of assistance under this section if the information requested is for purposes directly connected with the administration of a grant under this section.

(h) An organization receiving a grant under this section shall provide to the department a copy of its quarterly report made under 42 U.S.C. 611. The organization shall have its financial records audited annually by a certified public accountant authorized to practice under AS 08.04. The department may prescribe the form and specify the information required to document compliance with this section.

(i) If an organization wishes to terminate its program before the end of the time period for which the grant was awarded under this section, the organization must obtain the consent of the department or provide notice to the department 120 days before the anticipated date of termination. At the end of a grant agreement or by early termination under this section, the organization shall provide an inventory of property valued at $1,000 or over and purchased, in whole or in part, with grant money awarded under this section. The department shall notify the organization of the required disposition of the property listed on the inventory.

(j) If the department awards a grant under this section, a person applying for assistance under this chapter who is covered by the federally approved tribal family assistance plan in that region of the state may obtain assistance from the department only through the organization designated by the department to serve the region. A person aggrieved by a decision made by an organization under a grant awarded under this section may use the appeal procedure specified in AS 47.27.300(e).

(k) Notwithstanding (j) of this section, a person applying for assistance under this chapter in a region of the state that is served by both an Alaska Native family assistance program that receives a grant under this section and a program administered directly by the department may request to receive assistance under the program administered directly by the department by applying to the department under this subsection and in accordance with regulations adopted under this subsection. The department shall approve the application if the department finds that the applicant has shown that special circumstances exist that support the request to use the state program.

(l) A participant in an Alaska Native family assistance program shall assign to the Alaska Native family assistance program, unless the program has elected to require assignment to the state, all rights to ongoing child support that accrues after the effective date of the assignment for the support of the individuals in the family for whom assistance is provided, but not to exceed the total amount of assistance paid by the Alaska Native family assistance program to the family. The assignment takes effect when information required under (n) of this section is provided to the child support services agency following the determination of eligibility. Except with respect to any unpaid support that accrued under the assignment, the assignment terminates when the family ceases to participate in the Alaska Native family assistance program. All assignments to an Alaska Native family assistance program of unpaid child support obligations transfer to the state upon the termination of an Alaska Native family assistance program.

(m) An Alaska Native family assistance program participant shall cooperate with the child support services agency in the manner described in AS 47.27.040(b) in establishing paternity or establishing, modifying, or enforcing a child support order requiring the payment of support by the noncustodial parent for a dependent child for whom assistance is received. The child support services agency shall inform the Alaska Native family assistance program if it determines that the participant is not in good faith compliance with the requirements of AS 47.27.040(b). The Alaska Native family assistance program shall determine whether the participant has good cause for refusing to cooperate.

(n) An Alaska Native family assistance program that receives assignments of ongoing child support shall provide public assistance information concerning those assignments to the child support services agency in a timely manner in order to establish a valid assignment. The information shall be provided by electronic means and in a format acceptable to the child support services agency. For the purposes of this subsection, "timely manner" means within the time constraints established for child support agency distributions under federal law.

(4) when the right to receive child support has been assigned to an Alaska Native family assistance program, an agreement under AS 25.27.065(a) that has not been adopted as an administrative order of the child support services agency is not effective during a period when the obligee is receiving assistance under an Alaska Native family assistance program;

(5) the child support services agency, on behalf of an Alaska Native family assistance program, shall take all necessary action permitted by law to enforce child support orders entered under AS 25.27, including petitioning the court for orders to aid in the enforcement of child support;

(7) notwithstanding AS 25.27.130(c), the recovery of an amount for which an obligor under AS 25.27 is liable that exceeds the total assistance granted under AS 47.07 and this chapter shall be paid to the obligee;

(8) except as provided in AS 25.27.130(f), if an obligee under AS 25.27 is not receiving assistance under AS 47.07 or this chapter at the time the state recovers money in an action under AS 25.27.130(d) or (1) of this subsection, the recovery of any amount for which the obligor is liable shall be distributed to the obligee for support payments, including medical support payments, that had become due and unpaid since the termination of assistance under AS 47.07 or this chapter under a support order in favor of the obligee;

(9) after payment to the obligee under (8) of this subsection, the state may retain an amount not to exceed the total unreimbursed assistance paid on behalf of the obligee under AS 47.07 or this chapter;

(10) if an alleged obligor is liable to an Alaska Native family assistance program under (1) of this subsection, and a support order has not been entered, the child support services agency may, at its own discretion, undertake an action to establish paternity and a duty of support using the procedures prescribed in AS 25.27 and may enforce a duty of support using the procedures prescribed in AS 25.27; the agency may also institute administrative proceedings to determine the paternity of a child born out of wedlock upon application of an Alaska Native family assistance program; the agency may not recover costs of genetic tests required under this paragraph from a person who is a recipient of assistance under an Alaska Native family assistance program;

###### Sec. 47.30.655.   Purpose and principles of major revision.

The purpose of the 1981 major revision of Alaska civil commitment statutes (AS 47.30.660 and 47.30.670§47.30.915) is to more adequately protect the legal rights of persons suffering from mental illness.  The legislature has attempted to balance the individual's constitutional right to physical liberty and the state's interest in protecting society from persons who are dangerous to others and protecting persons who are dangerous to themselves by providing due process safeguards at all stages of commitment proceedings.  In addition, the following principles of modern mental health care have guided this revision:

(1) that persons be given every reasonable opportunity to accept voluntary treatment before involvement with the judicial system;

(2) that persons be treated in the least restrictive alternative environment consistent with their treatment needs;

(3) that treatment occur as promptly as possible and as close to the individual's home as possible;

(4) that a system of mental health community facilities and supports be available;

(5) that patients be informed of their rights and be informed of and allowed to participate in their treatment program as much as possible;

(6) that persons who are mentally ill but not dangerous to others be committed only if there is a reasonable expectation of improving their mental condition.

###### Sec. 47.30.660.   Cooperative powers and duties of the Department of Family and Community Services and the Department of Health.

The ex parte order shall be provided to the respondent and made a part of the respondent's clinical record.  The court shall confirm an oral order in writing within 24 hours after it is issued.

(b) The petition required in (a) of this section must allege that the respondent is reasonably believed to present a likelihood of serious harm to self or others or is gravely disabled as a result of mental illness and must specify the factual information on which that belief is based including the names and addresses of all persons known to the petitioner who have knowledge of those facts through personal observation.

###### Sec. 47.30.705.   Emergency detention for evaluation.

(a) A peace officer, health officer, mental health professional, or physician assistant licensed by the State Medical Board to practice in this state who has probable cause to believe that a person is gravely disabled or is suffering from mental illness and is likely to cause serious harm to self or others of such immediate nature that considerations of safety do not allow initiation of involuntary commitment procedures set out in AS 47.30.700, may cause the person to be taken into custody by a peace officer or health officer and delivered to the nearest crisis stabilization center, crisis residential center, evaluation facility, or treatment facility. A person taken into custody for emergency evaluation may not be placed in a jail or other correctional facility except for protective custody purposes and only while awaiting transportation to a crisis stabilization center, crisis residential center, evaluation facility, or treatment facility.

A mental health professional shall examine the respondent within three hours after the respondent arrives at the center.

(b) If the professional person in charge at the crisis stabilization center determines that there is probable cause to believe that the respondent has a mental illness and is suffering an acute behavioral health crisis and, as a result, is likely to cause serious harm to self or others or is gravely disabled, the respondent's acute behavioral health crisis will be resolved during admission to a crisis residential center or evaluation facility, and the respondent is not willing to voluntarily go to the crisis residential center or evaluation facility, a mental health professional may submit an ex parte application to the court under this section for detention at the crisis residential center or evaluation facility.

(2) the respondent's acute behavioral health crisis will be resolved during admission to the crisis residential center.

(c) If a mental health professional admits a respondent to a crisis residential center and a judicial order has not been obtained under AS 47.30.707, the mental health professional may apply for an ex parte order under this section authorizing admission to the crisis residential center. Based on the application, if the court finds that probable cause exists to believe that the respondent has a mental illness and is suffering an acute behavioral health crisis and, as a result, is likely to cause serious harm to self or others or is gravely disabled and the respondent's acute behavioral health crisis will be resolved during admission to a crisis residential center, the court shall grant the application and appoint an attorney to represent the respondent.

Computation of the 72-hour period at a crisis residential center before a hearing does not include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, except that if the exclusion of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays from the computation of the 72-hour period would result in the respondent being held for longer than 72 hours, the 72-hour period ends at 5:00 p.m. on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The hearing shall be held at the crisis residential center in person, by contemporaneous two-way video conference, or by teleconference, absent extraordinary circumstances.

(B) the respondent's acute behavioral health crisis will be resolved during admission to the crisis residential center; or

(2) shall order the respondent released if the court finds no probable cause.

(2) prevent such deterioration of the respondent's mental condition that subsequent treatment might not enable the respondent to recover; or

(3) allow the respondent to prepare for and participate in the proceedings.

(f) A respondent, if represented by counsel, may waive, orally or in writing, the 72-hour time limit on the 30-day commitment hearing and have the hearing set for a date no more than seven calendar days after arrival at the facility.

(1) to be present at the hearing; this right may be waived only with the respondent's informed consent; if the respondent is incapable of giving informed consent, the respondent may be excluded from the hearing only if the court, after hearing, finds that the incapacity exists and that there is a substantial likelihood that the respondent's presence at the hearing would be severely injurious to the respondent's mental or physical health;

(2) to view and copy all petitions and reports in the court file of the respondent's case;

(3) to have the hearing open or closed to the public as the respondent elects;

(8) to remain silent;

(9) to call experts and other witnesses to testify on the respondent's behalf.

(c) At the conclusion of the hearing the court may commit the respondent to a treatment facility for not more than 30 days if it finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent is mentally ill and as a result is likely to cause harm to the respondent or others or is gravely disabled.

(d) If the court finds that there is a viable less restrictive alternative available and that the respondent has been advised of and refused voluntary treatment through the alternative, the court may order the less restrictive alternative treatment for not more than 30 days if the program accepts the respondent.

(e) The court shall specifically state to the respondent, and give the respondent written notice, that if commitment or other involuntary treatment beyond the 30 days is to be sought, the respondent has the right to a full hearing or jury trial.

###### Sec. 47.30.740.   Procedure for 90-day commitment following 30-day commitment.

(a) At any time during the respondent's 30-day commitment, the professional person in charge, or that person's professional designee, may file with the court a petition for a 90-day commitment of that respondent.  The petition must include all material required under AS 47.30.730(a) except that references to "30 days" shall be read as "90 days"; and

(1) allege that the respondent has attempted to inflict or has inflicted serious bodily harm upon the respondent or another since the respondent's acceptance for evaluation, or that the respondent was committed initially as a result of conduct in which the respondent attempted or inflicted serious bodily harm upon the respondent or another, or that the respondent continues to be gravely disabled, or that the respondent demonstrates a current intent to carry out plans of serious harm to the respondent or another;

(2) allege that the respondent has received appropriate and adequate care and treatment during the respondent's 30-day commitment;

(3) be verified by the professional person in charge, or that person's professional designee, during the 30-day commitment.

(b) The court shall have copies of the petition for 90-day commitment served upon the respondent, the respondent's attorney, and the respondent's guardian, if any.  The petition for 90-day commitment and proofs of service shall be filed with the clerk of the court, and a date for hearing shall be set, by the end of the next judicial day, for not later than five judicial days from the date of filing of the petition. The clerk shall notify the respondent, the respondent's attorney, and the petitioner of the hearing date at least three judicial days in advance of the hearing.

(c) Findings of fact relating to the respondent's behavior made at a 30-day commitment hearing under AS 47.30.735 shall be admitted as evidence and may not be rebutted except that newly discovered evidence may be used for the purpose of rebutting the findings.

###### Sec. 47.30.745.   90-day commitment hearing rights; continued commitment.

(a) A respondent subject to a petition for 90-day commitment has, in addition to the rights specified elsewhere in this chapter, or otherwise applicable, the rights enumerated in this section. Written notice of these rights shall be served on the respondent and the respondent's attorney and guardian, if any, and may be served on an adult designated by the respondent at the time the petition for 90-day commitment is served.  An attempt shall be made by oral explanation to ensure that the respondent understands the rights enumerated in the notice. If the respondent does not understand English, the explanation shall be given in a language the respondent understands.

(b) Unless the respondent is released or is admitted voluntarily following the filing of a petition and before the hearing, the respondent is entitled to a judicial hearing within five judicial days of the filing of the petition as set out in AS 47.30.740(b) to determine if the respondent is mentally ill and as a result is likely to cause harm to self or others, or if the respondent is gravely disabled.  If the respondent is admitted voluntarily following the filing of the petition, the voluntary admission constitutes a waiver of any hearing rights under AS 47.30.740 or under AS 47.30.685.  If at any time during the respondent's voluntary admission under this subsection, the respondent submits to the facility a written request to leave, the professional person in charge may file with the court a petition for a 180-day commitment of the respondent under AS 47.30.770.  The 180-day commitment hearing shall be scheduled for a date not later than 90 days after the respondent's voluntary admission.

(c) The respondent is entitled to a jury trial upon request filed with the court if the request is made at least two judicial days before the hearing.  If the respondent requests a jury trial, the hearing may be continued for no more than 10 calendar days.  The jury shall consist of six persons.

(d) If a jury trial is not requested, the court may still continue the hearing at the respondent's request for no more than 10 calendar days.

(e) The respondent has a right to retain an independent licensed physician or other mental health professional to examine the respondent and to testify on the respondent's behalf.  Upon request by an indigent respondent, the court shall appoint an independent licensed physician or other mental health professional to examine the respondent and testify on the respondent's behalf.  The court shall consider an indigent respondent's request for a specific physician or mental health professional.  A motion for the appointment may be filed in court at any reasonable time before the hearing and shall be acted upon promptly.  Reasonable fees and expenses for expert examiners shall be determined by the rules of court.

(f) The proceeding shall in all respects be in accord with constitutional guarantees of due process and, except as otherwise specifically provided in AS 47.30.700§47.30.915, the rules of evidence and procedure in civil proceedings.

(g) Until the court issues a final decision, the respondent shall continue to be treated at the treatment facility unless the petition for 90-day commitment is withdrawn.  If a decision has not been made within 20 days of filing of the petition, not including extensions of time due to jury trial or other requests by the respondent, the respondent shall be released.

###### Sec. 47.30.750.   Conduct of hearing.

The hearing under AS 47.30.745 shall be conducted in the same manner, and with the same rights for the respondent, as set out in AS 47.30.735(b).

###### Sec. 47.30.755.   Court order.

(a) After the hearing and within the time limit specified in AS 47.30.745, the court may commit the respondent to a treatment facility for no more than 90 days if the court or jury finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is mentally ill and as a result is likely to cause harm to self or others, or is gravely disabled.

(b) If the court finds that there is a less restrictive alternative available and that the respondent has been advised of and refused voluntary treatment through the alternative, the court may order the less restrictive alternative treatment after acceptance by the program of the respondent for a period not to exceed 90 days.

###### Sec. 47.30.760.   Placement at closest facility.

Treatment shall always be available at a state-operated hospital; however, if space is available and upon acceptance by another treatment facility, a respondent who is committed by the court shall be placed by the department at the designated treatment facility closest to the respondent's home unless the court finds that

(1) another treatment facility in the state has a program more suited to the respondent's condition, and this interest outweighs the desirability of the respondent being closer to home;

(2) another treatment facility in the state is closer to the respondent's friends or relatives who could benefit the respondent through their visits and communications; or

(3) the respondent wants to be further removed from home, and the mental health professionals who sought the respondent's commitment concur in the desirability of removed placement.

###### Sec. 47.30.765.   Appeal.

The respondent has the right to an appeal from an order of involuntary commitment.  The court shall inform the respondent of this right.

###### Sec. 47.30.770.   Additional 180-day commitment.

(a) The respondent shall be released from involuntary treatment at the expiration of 90 days unless the professional person in charge files a petition for a 180-day commitment conforming to the requirements of AS 47.30.740(a) except that all references to "30-day commitment" shall be read as "the previous 90-day commitment" and all references to "90-day commitment" shall be read as "180-day commitment".

(b) The procedures for service of the petition, notification of rights, and judicial hearing shall be as set out in AS 47.30.740§47.30.750.  If the court or jury finds by clear and convincing evidence that the grounds for 90-day commitment as set out in AS 47.30.755 are present, the court may order the respondent committed for an additional treatment period not to exceed 180 days from the date on which the first 90-day treatment period would have expired.

(c) Successive 180-day commitments are permissible on the same ground and under the same procedures as the original 180-day commitment.  An order of commitment may not exceed 180 days.

(d) Findings of fact relating to the respondent's behavior made at a 30-day commitment hearing under AS 47.30.735, a 90-day commitment hearing under AS 47.30.750, or a previous 180-day commitment hearing under this section shall be admitted as evidence and may not be rebutted except that newly discovered evidence may be used for the purpose of rebutting the findings.

###### Sec. 47.30.772.   Medication and treatment.

An evaluation facility or designated treatment facility may administer medication or other treatment to an involuntarily committed patient only in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of AS 47.30.817§47.30.865.

###### Sec. 47.30.775.   Commitment of minors.

The provisions of AS 47.30.700§47.30.815 apply to minors. However, all notices required to be served on the respondent in AS 47.30.700§47.30.815 shall also be served on the parent or guardian of a respondent who is a minor, and parents or guardians of a minor respondent shall be notified that they may appear as parties in any commitment proceeding concerning the minor and that as parties they are entitled to retain their own attorney or have the office of public advocacy appointed for them by the court.  A minor respondent has the same rights to waiver and informed consent as an adult respondent under AS 47.30.660§47.30.915; however, the minor shall be represented by counsel in waiver and consent proceedings.

###### Sec. 47.30.780.   Early discharge.

(a) Except as provided in (b) of this section, the professional person in charge shall at any time discharge a respondent on the ground that the respondent is no longer gravely disabled or likely to cause serious harm as a result of mental illness. A certificate to this effect shall be sent to the court, which shall enter an order officially terminating the involuntary commitment.

(b) The professional person in charge shall give the prosecuting authority 10 days' notice before discharging a respondent who was committed after having been found incompetent to proceed under AS 12.47.110.

###### Sec. 47.30.785.   Authorized absences.

A respondent undergoing involuntary treatment on an inpatient basis under AS 47.30.700§47.30.815 may be authorized to be absent from the treatment facility during times specified by the professional person in charge, or that person's professional designee, when an authorization to be absent is in the best interests of the respondent and the respondent is not likely to cause harm to self or others.

###### Sec. 47.30.790.   Unauthorized absences: return to facility; required notice.

When a respondent undergoing involuntary treatment on an inpatient basis is absent from the treatment facility without, or in excess of, authorization under AS 47.30.785, the professional person in charge, or that person's professional designee, may contact the appropriate peace officers who shall take the respondent into custody and return the respondent to the treatment facility.  If it is determined by the professional person in charge to be necessary, a member of the treatment facility staff shall accompany the peace officers when they take the respondent into custody.  In addition, the family or guardian of the patient and any person known to have been threatened by the patient shall be notified of the patient's unauthorized absence immediately upon its discovery.

###### Sec. 47.30.795.   Involuntary outpatient care for committed persons.

(a) A respondent who was originally committed to involuntary inpatient care under AS 47.30.700§47.30.915 may be released before the expiration of the commitment period if a provider of outpatient care accepts the respondent for specified outpatient treatment for a period of time not to exceed the duration of the commitment, and if the professional person in charge, or that person's professional designee, finds that

(1) it is not necessary to treat the respondent as an inpatient to prevent the respondent from harming self or others; and

(2) there is reason to believe that the respondent's mental condition would improve as a result of the outpatient treatment.

(b) A copy of the conditions for early release shall be given to the respondent and the respondent's attorney and guardian, if any, the provider of outpatient care, and the court.

(c) If during the commitment period the provider of outpatient care determines that the respondent can no longer be treated on an outpatient basis because the respondent is likely to cause harm to self or others or is gravely disabled, the provider shall give the respondent oral and written notice that the respondent must return to the treatment facility within 24 hours, with copies to the respondent's attorney and guardian, if any, the court, and the inpatient treatment facility.  If the respondent fails to arrive at the treatment facility within 24 hours after receiving the notice, the professional person in charge may contact the appropriate peace officers who shall take the respondent into custody and transport the respondent to the facility.  If it is determined by the professional person in charge to be necessary, a member of the treatment facility staff shall accompany the peace officers when they take the respondent into custody.

(d) If the provider of outpatient care determines that the respondent will require continued outpatient care after the expiration of the commitment period, the provider may initiate further commitment proceedings as if the provider were the professional person in charge, and the provisions of AS 47.30.660§47.30.915 apply, except that provisions relating to inpatient treatment shall be read as applicable to outpatient treatment.

###### Sec. 47.30.800.   Conversion of involuntary outpatient treatment to inpatient commitment.

(a) A respondent ordered by the court under the provisions of AS 47.30.700§47.30.915 to receive involuntary outpatient treatment may be required to undergo inpatient treatment when the provider of outpatient care finds that (1) the respondent is mentally ill and is likely to cause serious harm to self or others or is still gravely disabled; (2) the respondent's behavior since the hearing resulting in court-ordered treatment indicates that the respondent now needs inpatient treatment to protect self or others; (3) there is reason to believe that the respondent's mental condition will improve as a result of inpatient treatment; and (4) there is an inpatient facility appropriate to the respondent's need that will accept the respondent as a patient.  Treatment for these respondents shall be available at state-operated hospitals at all times.

(b) Upon making the findings specified in (a) of this section, the provisions of AS 47.30.795(c) relating to notice and AS 47.30.745 relating to hearings apply.

(4) a 90-day commitment period expires at the end of the 90th day after the expiration of a 30-day period of treatment;

(5) a 180-day commitment period expires at the end of the 180th day, after the expiration of a 90-day period of treatment or previous 180-day period, whichever is applicable.

(b) When a respondent has failed to appear or been absent through the respondent's own actions contrary to any order properly made or entered under AS 47.30.660§47.30.915, the relevant commitment period shall be extended for a period of time equal to the respondent's absence if written notice of absence is promptly provided to the respondent's attorney and guardian, if any, and if, within 24 hours after the respondent has returned to the evaluation or treatment facility, written notice of the corresponding extension and the reason for it is given to the respondent and the respondent's attorney and guardian, if any, and to the court.

###### Sec. 47.30.810.   Habeas corpus not limited.

Nothing in AS 47.30.660§47.30.915 may be construed as limiting a person's right to a writ of habeas corpus.

###### Sec. 47.30.815.   Limitation of liability; bad faith application a felony.

(a) A person acting in good faith upon either actual knowledge or reliable information who makes application for evaluation or treatment of another person under AS 47.30.700§47.30.915 is not subject to civil or criminal liability.

(b) The following persons may not be held civilly or criminally liable for detaining a person under AS 47.30.700§47.30.915 or for releasing a person under AS 47.30.700§47.30.915 at or before the end of the period for which the person was admitted or committed for evaluation or treatment if the persons have performed their duties in good faith and without gross negligence:

The mental health care professionals may not withhold any of the information described in this subsection from the patient or from others if the patient has signed a waiver of confidentiality or has designated the person who would receive the information as an agent or surrogate under AS 13.52 with regard to mental health treatment.

(c) A patient who is capable of giving informed consent has the right to give and withhold consent to medication and treatment in all situations that do not involve a crisis or impending crisis as described in AS 47.30.838(a)(1). A facility shall follow the procedures required under AS 47.30.836§47.30.839 before administering psychotropic medication.

(d) A locked quiet room, or other form of physical restraint, may not be used, except as provided in this subsection, unless a patient is likely to physically harm self or others unless restrained. The form of restraint used shall be that which is in the patient's best interest and which constitutes the least restrictive alternative available. When practicable, the patient shall be consulted as to the patient's preference among forms of adequate, medically advisable restraints including medication, and that preference shall be honored. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the right of staff to use a quiet room at the patient's request or with the patient's knowing concurrence when considered in the best interests of the patient. Patients placed in a quiet room or other physical restraint shall be checked at least every 15 minutes or more often if good medical practice so indicates. Patients in a quiet room must be visited by a staff member at least once every hour and must be given adequate food and drink and access to bathroom facilities. At no time may a patient be kept in a quiet room or other form of physical restraint against the patient's will longer than necessary to accomplish the purposes set out in this subsection. All uses of a quiet room or other restraint shall be recorded in the patient's medical record, the information including but not limited to the reasons for its use, the duration of use, and the name of the authorizing staff member.

(e)  [Repealed,§12 ch 109 SLA 1992.]

(f) A patient capable of giving informed consent has the absolute right to accept or refuse electroconvulsive therapy or aversive conditioning. A patient who lacks substantial capacity to make this decision may not be given this therapy or conditioning without a court order unless the patient expressly authorized that particular form of treatment in an advance health care directive properly executed under AS 13.52 or has authorized an agent or surrogate under AS 13.52 to make this decision and the agent or surrogate consents to the treatment on behalf of the patient.

(g) In no event may treatment include psychosurgery, lobotomy, or other comparable form of treatment without specific informed consent of the patient, including a minor unless the minor is clearly too young or disabled to give an informed consent in which case the consent of the minor's legal guardian is required.  In addition, this treatment may not be given without a court order after hearing compatible with full due process.

(h) When, in the written opinion of a patient's attending physician, a true medical emergency exists and a surgical operation is necessary to save the life, physical health, eyesight, hearing, or member of the patient, the professional person in charge, or that person's professional designee, may give consent to the surgical operation if time will not permit obtaining the consent of the proper relatives or guardian or appropriate judicial authority.  However, an operation may not be authorized if the patient is not a minor and knowingly withholds consent on religious grounds.

(i) A patient upon discharge shall be given a discharge plan specifying the kinds and amount of care and treatment the patient should have after discharge and such other steps as the patient might take to benefit the patient's mental health after leaving the facility.  The patient shall have the right to participate, as far as practicable, in formulating the patient's discharge plan.  A copy of the plan shall be given to the patient, the patient's guardian, an adult designated in accordance with AS 47.30.725, the court if appropriate, and any follow-up agencies.

###### Sec. 47.30.830.   Prohibition of experimental treatments.

(a) Experimental treatments involving any significant risk of physical or psychological harm may not be administered to a patient.

(b) If the personnel of an evaluation or treatment facility are uncertain as to whether a proposed treatment is experimental or is experimental as applied to a particular patient or would involve a significant risk of mental or physical harm to the patient, the matter may be referred to the commissioner for a determination.  The patient, the patient's attorney and guardian, if any, and an adult designated by the patient, shall, simultaneously with the referral to the commissioner, be provided with copies of all the documents by which the referral is made and shall have the opportunity to provide evidence to the commissioner on the question.

(c) A determination by the commissioner that a treatment is experimental and entails significant risks of mental or physical harm is binding upon all persons involved in the administration of treatment to a patient.

###### Sec. 47.30.833.   Nutritional evaluation; right to proper diet.

(a) A treatment facility shall conduct a nutritional evaluation of a person admitted or committed to a treatment facility for evaluation or treatment, whether the person is a voluntary or involuntary patient.  The evaluation shall be conducted within the first week after the patient is admitted or committed.

(b) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, a treatment facility is not required to conduct a nutritional evaluation of a patient who is released within 72 hours of arrival.

(c) A patient has the right to a nutritionally sound and medically appropriate diet.  After conducting the nutritional evaluation required under (a) of this section, the treatment facility shall take appropriate steps to correct the patient's nutritional deficiencies.

###### Sec. 47.30.835.   Civil rights not impaired.

(a) A person may not deny to a person who is undergoing evaluation or treatment under AS 47.30.660§47.30.915 a civil right, including but not limited to, the right to free exercise of religion and the right to dispose of property, sue and be sued, enter into contractual relationships, and vote.  A person who violates this subsection commits the crime of interference with constitutional rights under AS 11.76.110.

(b) Court-ordered evaluation or treatment under AS 47.30.660§47.30.915 is not a determination of legal incapacity under AS 13.26.005§13.26.580.

###### Sec. 47.30.836.   Psychotropic medication in non-crisis situation.

(a) An evaluation facility or designated treatment facility may not administer psychotropic medication to a patient in a situation that does not involve a crisis under AS 47.30.838(a)(1) unless the patient

(1) has the capacity to give informed consent to the medication, as described in AS 47.30.837, and gives that consent; the facility shall document the consent in the patient's medical chart;

(2) authorized the use of psychotropic medication in an advance health care directive properly executed under AS 13.52 or authorized an agent or surrogate under AS 13.52 to consent to the use of psychotropic medication for the patient and the agent or surrogate does consent; or

(3) is determined by a court to lack the capacity to give informed consent to the medication and the court approves use of the medication under AS 47.30.839.

(b) Before administering psychotropic medication to a minor patient under this section, a mental health professional shall consult with a parent or guardian of the minor, evaluate the minor for drug withdrawal and medical psychosis caused by currently prescribed drugs or self-medication, and review all available information regarding the minor's family history, diet, medications, and other contributing factors.

###### Sec. 47.30.837.   Informed consent.

(a) A patient has the capacity to give informed consent for purposes of AS 47.30.836 if the patient is competent to make mental health or medical treatment decisions and the consent is voluntary and informed.

(b) When seeking a patient's informed consent under this section, the evaluation facility or designated treatment facility shall give the patient information that is necessary for informed consent in a manner that ensures maximum possible comprehension by the patient.

(c) If an evaluation facility or designated treatment facility has provided to the patient the information necessary for the patient's consent to be informed and the patient voluntarily consents, the facility may administer psychotropic medication to the patient unless the facility has reason to believe that the patient is not competent to make medical or mental health treatment decisions. If the facility has reason to believe that the patient is not competent to make medical or mental health treatment decisions and the facility wishes to administer psychotropic medication to the patient, the facility shall follow the procedures of AS 47.30.839.

(d) In this section,

(1) "competent" means that the patient

(A) has the capacity to assimilate relevant facts and to appreciate and understand the patient's situation with regard to those facts, including the information described in (2) of this subsection;

(B) appreciates that the patient has a mental disorder or impairment, if the evidence so indicates; denial of a significantly disabling disorder or impairment, when faced with substantial evidence of its existence, constitutes evidence that the patient lacks the capability to make mental health treatment decisions;

(C) has the capacity to participate in treatment decisions by means of a rational thought process; and

(D) is able to articulate reasonable objections to using the offered medication;

(2) "informed" means that the evaluation facility or designated treatment facility has given the patient all information that is material to the patient's decision to give or withhold consent, including

(A) an explanation of the patient's diagnosis and prognosis, or their predominant symptoms, with and without the medication;

(B) information about the proposed medication, its purpose, the method of its administration, the recommended ranges of dosages, possible side effects and benefits, ways to treat side effects, and risks of other conditions, such as tardive dyskinesia;

(a) Except as provided in (c) and (d) of this section, an evaluation facility or designated treatment facility may administer psychotropic medication to a patient without the patient's informed consent, regardless of whether the patient is capable of giving informed consent, only if

(1) there is a crisis situation, or an impending crisis situation, that requires immediate use of the medication to preserve the life of, or prevent significant physical harm to, the patient or another person, as determined by a physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse; the behavior or condition of the patient giving rise to a crisis under this paragraph and the staff's response to the behavior or condition must be documented in the patient's medical record; the documentation must include an explanation of alternative responses to the crisis that were considered or attempted by the staff and why those responses were not sufficient; and

(2) the medication is ordered by a physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse; the order

(A) may be written or oral and may be received by telephone, facsimile machine, or in person;

(B) may include an initial dosage and may authorize additional, as needed, doses; if additional, as needed, doses are authorized, the order must specify the medication, the quantity of each authorized dose, the method of administering the medication, the maximum frequency of administration, the specific conditions under which the medication may be given, and the maximum amount of medication that may be administered to the patient in a 24-hour period;

(C) is valid for only 24 hours and may be renewed by a physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse for a total of 72 hours, including the initial 24 hours, only after a personal assessment of the patient's status and a determination that there is still a crisis situation as described in (1) of this subsection; upon renewal of an order under this subparagraph, the facts supporting the renewal shall be written into the patient's medical record.

(b) When a patient is no longer in the crisis situation that led to the use of psychotropic medication without consent under (a) of this section, an appropriate health care professional shall discuss the crisis with the patient, including precursors to the crisis, in order to increase the patient's and the professional's understanding of the episode and to discuss prevention of future crises. The professional shall seek and consider the patient's recommendations for managing potential future crises.

(c) If crisis situations as described in (a)(1) of this section occur repeatedly, or if it appears that they may occur repeatedly, the evaluation facility, crisis stabilization center, crisis residential center, or designated treatment facility may administer psychotropic medication during not more than three crisis periods without the patient's informed consent only with court approval under AS 47.30.839.

(d) An evaluation facility or designated treatment facility may administer psychotropic medication to a patient without the patient's informed consent if the patient is unable to give informed consent but has authorized the use of psychotropic medication in an advance health care directive properly executed under AS 13.52 or has authorized an agent or surrogate under AS 13.52 to consent to this form of treatment for the patient and the agent or surrogate does consent.

(e) Before determining whether a minor patient should be given psychotropic medication under this section, a mental health professional shall, to the extent time and the nature of the crisis permit, consult with a parent or guardian of the minor, evaluate the minor for drug withdrawal and medical psychosis caused by currently prescribed drugs or self-medication, and review all available information regarding the minor's family history, diet, medications, and other possibly relevant factors.

###### Sec. 47.30.839.   Court-ordered administration of medication.

(a) An evaluation facility or designated treatment facility may use the procedures described in this section to obtain court approval of administration of psychotropic medication if

(1) there have been, or it appears that there will be, repeated crisis situations as described in AS 47.30.838(a)(1) and the facility wishes to use psychotropic medication in future crisis situations; or

(2) the facility wishes to use psychotropic medication in a noncrisis situation and has reason to believe the patient is incapable of giving informed consent.

(b) An evaluation facility or designated treatment facility may seek court approval for administration of psychotropic medication to a patient by filing a petition with the court, requesting a hearing on the capacity of the person to give informed consent and on the proposed use of psychotropic medication. The petition shall provide specific information regarding the factors listed in AS 47.30.837(d)(2)(A)§(e).

(c) A patient who is the subject of a petition under (b) of this section is entitled to an attorney to represent the patient at the hearing. If the patient cannot afford an attorney, the court shall direct the Public Defender Agency to provide an attorney. The court may, upon request of the patient's attorney, direct the office of public advocacy to provide a guardian ad litem for the patient.

(d) Upon the filing of a petition under (b) of this section, the court shall appoint a visitor to assist the court in investigating the issue of whether the patient has the capacity to give or withhold informed consent to the administration of psychotropic medication. The visitor shall gather pertinent information and present it to the court in written or oral form at the hearing. The information must include documentation of the following:

(1) the patient's responses to a capacity assessment instrument administered at the request of the visitor;

(2) any expressed wishes of the patient regarding medication, including wishes that may have been expressed in a power of attorney, a living will, an advance health care directive under AS 13.52, or oral statements of the patient, including conversations with relatives and friends that are significant persons in the patient's life as those conversations are remembered by the relatives and friends; oral statements of the patient should be accompanied by a description of the circumstances under which the patient made the statements, when possible.

(e) Within 72 hours after the filing of a petition under (b) of this section, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the patient's capacity to give or withhold informed consent as described in AS 47.30.837 and the patient's capacity to give or withhold informed consent at the time of previously expressed wishes regarding medication if previously expressed wishes are documented under (d)(2) of this section. The court shall consider all evidence presented at the hearing, including evidence presented by the guardian ad litem, the petitioner, the visitor, and the patient. The patient's attorney may cross-examine any witness, including the guardian ad litem and the visitor.

(f) If the court determines that the patient is competent to provide informed consent, the court shall order the facility to honor the patient's decision about the use of psychotropic medication.

(g) If the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the patient is not competent to provide informed consent and was not competent to provide informed consent at the time of previously expressed wishes documented under (d)(2) of this section, that the proposed use of medication is in the best interests of the patient considering at a minimum the factors listed in AS 47.30.837(d)(2)(A)§(E), and that there is no feasible less intrusive alternative, the court shall approve the facility's proposed use of psychotropic medication. The court's approval under this subsection applies to the patient's initial period of commitment if the decision is made during that time period. If the decision is made during a period for which the initial commitment has been extended, the court's approval under this subsection applies to the period for which commitment is extended.

(h) If an evaluation facility or designated treatment facility wishes to continue the use of psychotropic medication without the patient's consent during a period of commitment that occurs after the period in which the court's approval was obtained, the facility shall file a request to continue the medication when it files the petition to continue the patient's commitment. The court that determines whether commitment shall continue shall also determine whether the patient continues to lack the capacity to give or withhold informed consent by following the procedures described in (b)§(e) of this section. The reports prepared for a previous hearing under (e) of this section are admissible in the hearing held for purposes of this subsection, except that they must be updated by the visitor and the guardian ad litem.

(i) If a patient for whom a court has approved medication under this section regains competency at any time during the period of the patient's commitment and gives informed consent to the continuation of medication, the evaluation facility or designated treatment facility shall document the patient's consent in the patient's file in writing.

(j) The Alaska Court System shall provide visitors in proceedings under this section. The Alaska Court System may contract for services of court-appointed visitors.

(b) The patient's rights under (a)(4), (5), (7) and (9) of this section may be suspended temporarily, following the initial evaluation period, if the professional person in charge of the patient determines that granting the patient those rights will pose a threat to the safety or well-being of the patient or others.

The order remains in effect unless modified by subsequent court order or department order.

(d) If a person who is hospitalized under AS 47.30.670§47.30.915 at an evaluation facility or a designated treatment facility cannot pay or substantially contribute to the payment of charges described under this section, the patient may apply for assistance under AS 47.31.

If a time period has not been set, a final administrative order against the entity has the effect of a permanent revocation, and the entity may not apply for a license or license renewal. If the ownership, control, or management of an entity changes, the department with licensing authority may allow the entity to seek licensure if the entity submits documents showing the change.

If all of the preceding facilities, including the person's home, are determined to be unavailable, a person taken into protective custody and assisted under this subsection may be taken to a state or municipal detention facility in the area. However, emergency protective custody under this subsection may not include placement of a minor in a jail or secure facility.

(b) A person who appears to be incapacitated by alcohol or drugs in a public place shall be taken into protective custody by a peace officer or a member of the emergency service patrol and immediately brought to an approved public treatment facility, an approved private treatment facility, or another appropriate health facility or service for emergency medical treatment. If no treatment facility or emergency medical service is available, a person who appears to be incapacitated by alcohol or drugs in a public place shall be taken to a state or municipal detention facility in the area if that appears necessary for the protection of the person's health or safety. However, emergency protective custody under this subsection may not include placement of a minor in a jail or secure facility.

(c) A person who voluntarily appears or is brought to an approved public treatment facility shall be examined by a licensed physician or other qualified health practitioner as soon as possible.

A person may not be detained at a facility if the person remains incapacitated by alcohol for more than 48 hours after admission as a patient. A person may consent to remain in the facility as long as the physician in charge considers it appropriate.

A detaining officer or a detention facility official may release a person who is detained under (a) or (b) of this section at any time to the custody of a responsible adult. A peace officer or a member of the emergency service patrol, in detaining a person under (a) or (b) of this section and in taking the person to a treatment facility, an emergency medical service, or a detention facility, is taking the person into protective custody and the officer or patrol member shall make reasonable efforts to provide for and protect the health and safety of the detainee. In taking a person into protective custody under (a) and (b) of this section, a detaining officer, a member of the emergency service patrol, or a detention facility official may take reasonable steps for self-protection, including a full protective search of the person of a detainee. Protective custody under (a) and (b) of this section does not constitute an arrest and no entry or other record may be made to indicate that the person detained has been arrested or charged with a crime, except that a confidential record may be made that is necessary for the administrative purposes of the facility to which the person has been taken or that is necessary for statistical purposes where the person's name may not be disclosed.

(a) An intoxicated person who (1) has threatened, attempted to inflict, or inflicted physical harm on another or is likely to inflict physical harm on another unless committed, or (2) is incapacitated by alcohol or drugs, may be committed to an approved public treatment facility for emergency treatment. A refusal to undergo treatment does not constitute evidence of lack of judgment as to the need for treatment.

(b) The certifying physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse, spouse, guardian, or relative of the person to be committed, or any other responsible person, may make a written application for commitment under this section, directed to the administrator of the approved public treatment facility. The application must state facts to support the need for emergency treatment and be accompanied by a physician's, physician assistant's, or advanced practice registered nurse's certificate supporting the need for emergency treatment and stating that the physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse has examined the person sought to be committed within two days before the certificate's date.

(c) Upon approval of the application by the administrator in charge of the facility, the person may be brought to the facility by a peace officer, a health officer, a member of the emergency service patrol, the applicant for commitment, the patient's spouse, the patient's guardian, or any other interested person.  The person shall be retained at the facility to which the person was admitted, or transferred to another appropriate public or private treatment facility, until discharged under (e) of this section.  However, a person may not be detained under this section for more than 48 hours unless a district or superior court judge has reviewed and approved the commitment application.

(d) The administrator in charge of an approved public treatment facility may refuse an application if in the administrator's opinion the application and certificate fail to sustain the grounds for commitment.

(e) When on the advice of the medical staff the administrator determines that the grounds for commitment no longer exist, the administrator shall discharge a person committed under this section.  A person committed under this section may not be detained in a treatment facility for more than five days. If a petition for involuntary commitment under AS 47.37.190 has been filed within the five days and the administrator in charge of an approved public treatment facility finds that grounds for emergency commitment still exist, the administrator may detain the person until the petition has been heard and determined, but no longer than 10 days after filing the petition.

(f) A copy of the written application for commitment and of the physician's, physician assistant's, or advanced practice registered nurse's certificate, and a written explanation of the person's right to legal counsel, shall be given to the person within 24 hours after commitment by the administrator, who shall provide a reasonable opportunity for the person to consult with legal counsel.

(g) The administrator of an approved public treatment facility may accept an application for commitment under this section from a health facility and may authorize the health facility to hold the person who is the subject of the commitment petition at the health facility as long as medically necessary, before transferring the person to the approved public treatment facility. An administrator who accepts an application for commitment from a health facility shall comply with the provisions of (c)§(f) of this section if the person being committed is held for longer than 48 hours from the time the administrator accepts the application for commitment under this subsection. A person committed under this subsection shall be transported from the health facility to the approved public treatment facility as soon as the person is discharged from the health facility. If the person being committed under this subsection is physically present at the health facility at the time an application for extension of detention is filed under (c) of this section or is physically present at the health facility when a petition for involuntary commitment is filed under (e) of this section, the administrator accepting the application for commitment under this subsection shall inform the court of where the person being committed is being held and when the person being committed is expected to be capable of being transferred to the approved public treatment facility.

###### Sec. 47.37.190.   Involuntary commitment.

(a) A spouse or guardian, a relative, the certifying physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse, or the administrator in charge of an approved public treatment facility may petition the court for a 30-day involuntary commitment order. The petition must allege that the person is an alcoholic or drug abuser who (1) has threatened, attempted to inflict, or inflicted physical harm on another and that unless committed is likely to inflict physical harm on another; or (2) is incapacitated by alcohol or drugs. A refusal to undergo treatment does not constitute evidence of lack of judgment as to the need for treatment. The petition must be accompanied by a certificate of a licensed physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse who has examined the person within two days before submission of the petition, unless the person whose commitment is sought has refused to submit to a medical examination, in which case the fact of refusal must be alleged in the petition. The certificate must set out the physician's, physician assistant's, or advanced practice registered nurse's findings of the examination in support of the allegations of the petition.

(b) After the petition is filed, the court shall fix a date for a hearing no later than 10 days after the date the petition was filed. A copy of the petition and of the notice of the hearing, including the date fixed by the court, shall be served on

(1) the petitioner;

(2) the person whose commitment is sought or the person's guardian, if any;

The person whose commitment is sought shall be present unless the court believes that being present is likely to be injurious to the person, in which case the court may conduct the hearing telephonically. The court may examine the person in open court, or, if advisable, examine the person out of court. If the person has refused to be examined under AS 47.37.180(b) or 47.37.190(a), the person shall be given an opportunity to request examination by a court-appointed licensed physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse. If the person fails to request a medical examination and there is sufficient evidence to believe that the allegations of the petition are true, or, if the court believes that more medical evidence is necessary, the court may issue a temporary order committing the person to a private or public facility for a period of not more than five days for purposes of a diagnostic examination.

(b) If after hearing all relevant evidence, including the results of any diagnostic examination by the private or public facility, the court finds that grounds for involuntary commitment have been clearly established, the court shall issue an order of 30-day commitment to the private or public facility.

The person whose commitment or recommitment is sought shall be informed of the right to be examined by a licensed physician of the person's choice. If the person is unable to obtain a licensed physician and requests examination by a physician, the court shall appoint a licensed physician for the examination.

(g) If a private treatment facility agrees with the request of a competent patient or the patient's parent, adult sibling, adult child, or guardian to accept the patient for treatment, the administrator of the public treatment facility shall transfer the patient to the private treatment facility.

(h) A person committed under this chapter may at any time seek discharge from commitment by writ of habeas corpus under AS 12.75.

The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children as contained in this section is enacted into law and entered into on behalf of the state with any and all other states legally joining in it in a form substantially as follows:

It is the purpose and policy of the party states to cooperate with each other in the interstate placement of children to the end that:

(a) Each child requiring placement shall receive the maximum opportunity to be placed in a suitable environment and with persons or institutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of care.

(b) The appropriate authorities in a state where a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with applicable requirements for the protection of the child.

(c) The proper authorities of the state from which the placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis of which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.

(d) Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of children will be promoted.

As used in this compact:

(a) "Child" means a person who, by reason of minority, is legally subject to parental, guardianship or similar control.

(b) "Sending agency" means a party state, officer or employee thereof; a subdivision of a party state, or officer or employee thereof; a court of a party state; a person, corporation, association, charitable agency or other entity which sends, brings, or causes to be sent or brought any child to another party state.

(c) "Receiving state" means the state to which a child is sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought, whether by public authorities or private persons or agencies, and whether for placement with state or local public authorities or for placement with private agencies or persons.

(d) "Placement" means the arrangement for the care of a child in a family free or boarding home or in a child-caring agency or institution but does not include any institution caring for the mentally ill, mentally defective or epileptic or any institution primarily educational in character, and any hospital or other medical facility.

(a) No sending agency shall send, bring, or cause to be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in this article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children therein.

(b) Prior to sending, bringing or causing any child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall furnish the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written notice of the intention to send, bring, or place the child in the receiving state.  The notice shall contain:

(1) The name, date and place of birth of the child.

(2) The identity and address or addresses of the parents or legal guardian.

(3) The name and address of the person, agency or institution to or with which the sending agency proposes to send, bring, or place the child.

(4) A full statement of the reasons for such proposed action and evidence of the authority pursuant to which the placement is proposed to be made.

(c) Any public officer or agency in a receiving state which is in receipt of a notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of this article may request of the sending agency, or any other appropriate officer or agency of or in the sending agency's state, and shall be entitled to receive therefrom, such supporting or additional information as it may deem necessary under the circumstances to carry out the purpose and policy of this compact.

(d) The child shall not be sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state shall notify the sending agency, in writing, to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child.

The sending, bringing, or causing to be sent or brought into any receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact shall constitute a violation of the laws respecting the placement of children of both the state in which the sending agency is located or from which it sends or brings the child and of the receiving state.  Such violations may be punished or subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in accordance with its laws.  In addition to liability for any such punishment or penalty, any such violation shall constitute full and sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license, permit, or other legal authorization held by the sending agency which empowers or allows it to place, or care for children.

(a) The sending agency shall retain jurisdiction over the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody, supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child which it would have had if the child had remained in the sending agency's state, until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-supporting or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state. Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law.

(2) Institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.

(b) Any placement, sending or bringing of a child into a receiving state pursuant to any other interstate compact to which both the state from which the child is sent or brought and the receiving state are party, or to any other agreement between said states which has the force of law.

This compact shall be open to joinder by any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and, with the consent of Congress, the Government of Canada or any province thereof. It shall become effective with respect to any such jurisdiction when such jurisdiction has enacted the same into law. Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until two years after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other party jurisdiction. Withdrawal of a party state shall not affect the rights, duties and obligations under this compact of any sending agency therein with respect to a placement made prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof.  The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.
