## Chapter 08. Interstate Mining Compact.

###### Sec. 27.08.010.   Compact enacted.

The Interstate Mining Compact contained in this section is enacted into law and entered into as follows:

(a) The party states find that

(1) mining and the contributions thereof to the economy and well-being of every state are of basic significance;

(2) the effects of mining on the availability of land, water, and other resources for other uses present special problems which properly can be approached only with due consideration for the rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the public;

(3) measures for the reduction of the adverse effects of mining on land, water, and other resources may be costly and the devising of means to deal with them are of both public and private concern;

(4) such variables as soil structure and composition, physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single standard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined land, or the development of mineral and other natural resources, but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the effects of mining on lands, water, and other resources may be reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly from state to state for all mining operations similarly situated;

(5) the states are in a position and have the responsibility to assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound conservation principles, and with due regard for local conditions.

(b) The purposes of this compact are to

(1) advance the protection and restoration of land, water, and other resources affected by mining;

(2) assist in the reduction or elimination or counteracting of pollution or deterioration of land, water, and air attributable to mining;

(3) encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional, physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party states which will achieve comparable results in protecting, conserving, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related operations may be universally facilitated;

(4) assist the party states in their efforts to facilitate the use of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever desirable, techniques for improvement, restoration or protection of such land and other resources;

(5) assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other benefits attributable to mining.

As used in this compact, the term

(1) "mining" means the breaking of the surface soil in order to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, or other solid matter, any activity or process constituting all or part of a process for the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, and other solid matter from its original location, and the preparation, washing, cleaning, or other treatment of minerals, ores, or other solid matter so as to make them suitable for commercial, industrial, or construction use, but shall not include those aspects of deep mining not having significant effect on the surface, and shall not include excavation of grading when conducted solely in aid of on-site farming or construction;

(2) "state" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or Territory or Possession of the United States.

Each party state agrees that within a reasonable time it will formulate and establish an effective program for the conservation and use of mined land, by the establishment of standards, enactment of laws, or the continuing of the same in force, to accomplish

(1) the protection of the public and the protection of adjoining and other landowners from damage to their lands and the structures and other property thereon resulting from the conduct of mining operations or the abandonment or neglect of land and property formerly used in the conduct of such operations;

(2) the conduct of mining and the handling of refuse and other mining wastes in ways that will reduce adverse effects on the economic, residential, recreational, or aesthetic value and utility of land and water;

(3) the institution and maintenance of suitable programs of adaptation, restoration, and rehabilitation of mined lands;

(4) the prevention, abatement, and control of water, air, and soil pollution resulting from mining§present, past, and future.

In addition to any other powers conferred upon the Interstate Mining Commission, established by Article V of this compact, such commission shall have the power to

(1) study mining operations, processes, and techniques for the purpose of gaining knowledge concerning the effects of such operations, processes, and techniques on land, soil, water, air, plant, and animal life, recreation, and patterns of community or regional development or change;

(2) study the conservation, adaptation, improvement, and restoration of land and related resources affected by mining;

(3) make recommendations concerning any aspect or aspects of law or practice and governmental administration dealing with matters within the purview of this compact;

(4) gather and disseminate information relating to any of the matters within the purview of this compact;

(5) cooperate with the federal government and any public or private entities having interests in any subject coming within the purview of this compact;

(6) consult, upon the request of a party state and within available resources, with the officials of such state in respect to any problem within the purview of this compact;

(7) study and make recommendations with respect to any practice, process, technique, or course of action that may improve the efficiency of mining or the economic yield from mining operations;

(8) study and make recommendations relating to the safeguarding of access to resources which are or may become the subject of mining operations to the end that the needs of the economy for the products of mining may not be adversely affected by unplanned or inappropriate use of land and other resources containing minerals or otherwise connected with actual or potential mining sites.

In addition to its use for mining operations under this chapter, the commissioner shall allow the bonding pool to be used to meet the requirements of AS 27.21.160. Income and other earnings on the bonding pool shall be added to the bonding pool.

(c) If the commissioner determines that a miner has violated or permitted a violation of the approved reclamation plan and has failed to comply with a lawful order of the commissioner, the commissioner shall forfeit the financial assurance and deposit it in the statewide bonding pool. The commissioner shall use the reclamation and administrative costs recovered under AS 27.19.070(a) to supplement the forfeited financial assurance deposited in the statewide bonding pool for reclamation of the site subject to the forfeiture. If the commissioner is unable to recover the full cost of reclamation under AS 27.19.070(a), the commissioner may use the bonding pool to reclaim the site to the standards of this chapter, except that the commissioner may not use a deposit that is refundable under (b) of this section to fulfill another miner's reclamation obligation.

(d) A miner not required to post a financial assurance may submit a reclamation plan under AS 27.19.030(a) and participate in the bonding pool.

(e) A miner may satisfy the requirement under this section for an individual financial assurance by providing, in a form acceptable to and approved by the commissioner, any of the following:

(1) total acreage and volume of material to be mined;

(2) total acreage to be reclaimed; and

(3) reclamation measures to be used.

(c) A miner exempt under (a) of this section shall file an annual reclamation statement with the commissioner disclosing the total acreage and volume of material mined by the operation in the current year, the total acreage reclaimed, and the specific reclamation measures used to comply with AS 27.19.020.  A miner does not qualify for an exemption under (a) of this section for subsequent operations unless the annual reclamation statement for the previous operation has been filed with the commissioner.

(d) A miner exempted from the requirements of AS 27.19.030(a) and 27.19.040 under (a) of this section that fails to reclaim a mining operation to the standards of AS 27.19.020 is required for two consecutive years to conduct each subsequent mining operation, regardless of size, under an approved reclamation plan and to provide an individual financial assurance.

###### Sec. 27.19.060.   Cooperative management agreements.

The commissioner, on a determination that an agreement is in the best interest of the state, may enter into a cooperative management agreement with the federal government or a state agency to implement a requirement of this chapter or a regulation adopted under it.

###### Sec. 27.19.070.   Violations.

(a) A miner who violates or permits a violation of an approved reclamation plan and fails to comply with a lawful order of the commissioner forfeits the financial assurance or a portion of the assurance and is liable to the state in a civil action for the full amount of reclamation and administrative costs incurred by the state related to the action. A miner exempted under AS 27.19.050(a) is subject to civil action for the full amount of reclamation and administrative costs incurred by the state related to the action if the commissioner determines that reclamation was not conducted under AS 27.19.020.

(b) In addition to other remedies available under this chapter, the commissioner may suspend or revoke permits or approvals of operations not being conducted under the approved reclamation plan and deny future mining permits and approvals under this title and AS 38 related to the mining operation for failure to reclaim the mining operation to the standards of this chapter.

(c) A miner who has forfeited a financial assurance or has been held liable in a civil action under (a) of this section may conduct future mining operations only after posting a reclamation risk assessment fee equal to five times the amount of financial assurance established under AS 27.19.040(a) for the proposed mining operation. The reclamation assessment fee shall be refunded after two consecutive years of operation consistent with this chapter.

#### Article 1. Legislative Findings and Purpose.

## Chapter 21. Alaska Surface Coal Mining Control and Reclamation Act.

###### Sec. 27.21.010.   Findings and declaration of purpose.

(a) The legislature finds and declares that

(1) the Congress of the United States has enacted the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, which provides for the establishment of a nationwide program to regulate surface coal mining and reclamation and which vests exclusive authority in the United States Department of the Interior over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation within the United States;

(2) section 101 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 contains the finding by Congress that because of the diversity in terrain, climate, biology, chemistry, and other physical conditions in areas subject to mining operations, primary governmental responsibility for developing, authorizing, issuing, and enforcing regulations for surface coal mining and reclamation operations subject to that Act should rest with the states;

(3) section 503 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 provides that each state may assume and retain exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in the state by obtaining approval of a state program of regulation that demonstrates that the state has the capability of carrying out the provisions and meeting the purposes of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977;

(4) section 503 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 provides that a state wishing to assume exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in the state must have a state law that provides for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with the requirements of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977; and

(5) because of unique environmental conditions that the state is best equipped to understand, the state intends to assume exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in the state under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.

(b) The purposes of this chapter are

(1) to prevent the adverse effects to society and the environment resulting from unregulated surface coal mining operations as defined in this chapter and the regulations adopted under it;

(2) to assure that the rights of surface land owners and other persons with an interest in the land are protected from unregulated surface coal mining operations;

(3) to assure that surface coal mining operations are conducted in a manner that will prevent unreasonable degradation of land and water resources;

(4) to assure that surface coal mining operations are not conducted where reclamation required by this chapter and the regulations adopted under it is not feasible;

(5) to assure that reclamation of land on which surface coal mining takes place is accomplished as contemporaneously as practicable with the surface coal mining, recognizing that the responsible extraction of coal by responsible mining operators is an essential and beneficial economic activity;

(6) to assure that appropriate procedures are provided for public participation in the development, revision, and enforcement of regulations, standards, and reclamation plans or programs established under this chapter;

(7) to assure that the coal supply essential to the nation's energy requirements and to its economic and social well-being is provided and to strike a balance between protection of the environment and other uses of the land and the need for coal as an essential source of energy; and

(8) to promote the reclamation of areas that were mined and left without adequate reclamation before the enactment of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 and that substantially degrade the quality of the environment, prevent the beneficial use of or cause damage to land or water resources, or endanger the health or safety of the public.

#### Article 2. Surface Coal Mining.

###### Sec. 27.21.020.   Jurisdiction.

(18) perform other duties required by this chapter.

###### Sec. 27.21.040.   Provisions of regulations and permits.

The provisions of a regulation adopted or a permit issued by the commissioner may vary for particular conditions, types of coal being extracted, or areas of the state if the provisions are consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

###### Sec. 27.21.050.   Conflict of interest.

An employee of the department or a private contractor performing a function or duty under this chapter may not have a direct or indirect financial interest in an underground or surface coal mining operation.  A person who knowingly violates this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.

###### Sec. 27.21.060.   Permits.

(a) Beginning eight months after May 2, 1983, a person may not conduct a surface coal mining and reclamation operation in the state without a permit for that operation. To receive a permit, a person must apply to the commissioner.  The commissioner shall process applications according to this chapter and regulations adopted under it.

(b)  [Repealed,§82 ch 6 SLA 1984.]

###### Sec. 27.21.070.   Term of permit.

(a) Permits will be issued for a term of five years.  However, the commissioner may grant a permit for a longer term if the application is complete for that longer term and the applicant demonstrates that the longer term is necessary to allow the applicant to obtain financing for equipment or for the opening of the operation.

(b) A permit terminates if a permittee does not begin surface coal mining operations under the permit within three years after the permit is issued.  The commissioner may grant reasonable extensions of time if the permittee shows that the extensions are necessary (1) because of litigation that precludes the commencement of the operation or threatens substantial economic loss to the permittee; or (2) for reasons beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the permittee. With respect to coal to be mined for use in a synthetic fuel facility or specific major electric generating facility, the permittee is considered to have begun surface mining operations at the time that the construction of the synthetic fuel or generating facility is begun.

###### Sec. 27.21.080.   Renewal of permit.

(a) A permit issued under this chapter includes the right of successive renewal upon expiration, for areas within the boundaries of the permit area. An opponent of renewal of a permit has the burden of proving that the permit should not be renewed.  Subject to (c) of this section, if a permittee applies for renewal of the permit, the commissioner shall renew the permit after public notice is given in the manner provided in AS 27.21.130 unless the commissioner finds, in writing, that

(1) the terms and conditions of the permit have not been satisfactorily met, and the permittee has not demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the permittee is meeting and will continue to meet a schedule set by the commissioner under AS 27.21.240(a) or (b) for correcting a permit violation;

(2) the surface coal mining and reclamation operation of the permittee is not in compliance with the environmental protection standards of this chapter and regulations adopted under it;

(3) the requested renewal substantially jeopardizes the permittee's continuing responsibility on existing permit areas;

(4) the permittee has not either

(A) provided sufficient evidence that the performance bond under AS 27.21.160 in effect for the operation will continue for the renewal period requested in the application, and that any additional bond required by the commissioner under AS 27.21.160 will be obtained; or

(B) when seeking to use the statewide bonding pool for mining operations established under AS 27.19.040(b), complied with all requirements of the bonding pool; or

(5) information required by the commissioner in accordance with this chapter has not been provided by the permittee.

(b) The commissioner shall provide notice to the appropriate public authorities as provided in AS 38.05.945 before approving a permit renewal.

(c) If an application for renewal of a permit includes a proposal to extend the permittee's surface coal mining operations to include new land areas beyond the boundaries authorized in the permit, the commissioner shall review the part of the application that addresses the new land areas under the standards established in AS 27.21.180.  However, if the surface coal mining operations authorized by a permit are not subject to the standards contained in AS 27.21.180(c)(5)(A) and (B), the part of the application for renewal that addresses new land areas previously identified in the reclamation plan submitted under AS 27.21.110 is not subject to the standards contained in AS 27.21.180(c)(5)(A) and (B).

(d) A permit may be renewed for an additional term of five years. The commissioner must receive the application for a permit renewal at least 120 days before the expiration of the permit.

(e) If a renewal application is received by the commissioner at least 120 days before the expiration date of the permit, and if the permittee has complied with AS 27.21.160, the permittee may continue surface coal mining operations under the permit after the expiration date of the permit until a final administrative decision on renewal is made.

###### Sec. 27.21.090.   Application fee.

(c) The person presiding at the hearing may administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, subpoena written or printed materials, compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of materials, and take evidence including but not limited to evidence derived from site inspections of the land that will be affected by the permit or revision and other surface coal mining operations conducted by the applicant in the general vicinity of the operation proposed in the application.  On the motion of a party or by order of the commissioner, a verbatim record of a hearing required by this chapter shall be made and a transcript made available.

###### Sec. 27.21.160.   Performance bond; exceptions.

(a) Except as provided in (c) and (g) of this section, after an application for a permit has been approved and before the permit may be issued, the applicant must file with the commissioner, on a form prescribed and furnished by the commissioner, a performance bond payable to the State of Alaska and conditioned on faithful performance of the requirements of this chapter and the permit.  The bond must cover the area of land within the permit area on which the applicant will initiate and conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations within the initial term of the permit. As succeeding increments of surface coal mining and reclamation operations are initiated and conducted within the permit area, the permittee shall provide an additional bond or bonds to cover those increments in accordance with this section.  The amount of the bond required for an area within the permit area shall be determined by the commissioner and shall reflect the probable difficulty of the reclamation considering the topography, geology, hydrology, revegetation potential, and similar factors relating to the area.  The amount of the bond must be sufficient to assure the completion of the reclamation plan by the commissioner in the event of forfeiture and, for the entire permit area, may not be less than $10,000.

(b) Liability under the bond must exist for the duration of the surface coal mining and reclamation operation and for the period of time of the permittee's responsibility under the performance standards established by regulation under AS 27.21.210.  The bond shall be executed by the applicant and, except as provided in (d) of this section, a corporate surety licensed to do business in the state.

(c) An applicant may deposit with the commissioner cash, negotiable bonds of the United States or of the state, or negotiable certificates of deposit of a bank organized or transacting business in the United States to satisfy the requirements of (a) of this section if

(1) the value of the deposit is equal to or greater than the amount of the bond required under (a) of this section;

(2) liability under the deposit is for a period of time described in (b) of this section; and

(3) the deposit is made under the terms that, under (a) of this section, would apply to a performance bond.

(d) The commissioner may accept a bond executed by the applicant without separate surety if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the applicant has sufficient financial means for the purposes of the bond.  The commissioner shall adopt regulations to implement this section.

(e) The commissioner shall maintain a deposit under (c) of this section in a separate escrow account and shall annually pay the interest accruing on the deposit to the permittee.

(f) The commissioner shall adjust the amount required under (a), (c), or (d) of this section and the terms of the acceptance of that amount if the commissioner determines there is good cause, including changes in affected land areas or in the probable cost of future reclamation, for the adjustment.

(g) As an alternative to performance bonds, applicants conducting surface coal mining and reclamation operations may use the bonding pool established by the commissioner under AS 27.19.040(b) for reclamation activities to meet the requirements imposed by this section.

###### Sec. 27.21.170.   Request and release of performance bonds or deposits.

(a) A permittee may file a request with the commissioner for the release of all or part of the permittee's performance bonds or deposit.  The permittee shall give notice in the manner set out in AS 38.05.945(b) and (c) except as provided by regulations adopted under this chapter.

(b) Within 30 days after receipt of a request under (a) of this section or within a longer period required by field conditions, the commissioner shall inspect and evaluate the reclamation work involved.

###### Sec. 27.21.240.   Enforcement.

(a) If, on the basis of an inspection under AS 27.21.230, the commissioner determines that a person or a person's operation is in violation of this chapter or a term of a permit and that the violation creates an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or is causing or can reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent, environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the commissioner shall immediately issue a notice of violation and order a cessation of the person's surface coal mining operation or the portion of the operation relating to the violation.  The cessation order remains in effect until the commissioner determines that the violation has been abated, or until modified, vacated, or terminated under (d) or (h) of this section.  If the commissioner finds that the ordered cessation of the operation, or a portion of the operation, will not completely abate the imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or the significant, imminent, environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the commissioner shall, in addition to the cessation order, impose affirmative obligations on the operator to take the steps the commissioner considers necessary to abate the imminent danger or significant environmental harm.

(b) If, on the basis of an inspection, the commissioner determines that a person or a person's operation is in violation of this chapter or a term of a permit and that the violation does not create an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public and is not causing and cannot reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent, environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the commissioner shall issue a notice of violation to the permittee setting a reasonable time, which may not exceed 90 days from the date the notice is issued, for the abatement of the violation.  However, the commissioner may, for good cause, extend the time for the abatement of the violation. If, at the end of the time allowed for abatement of the violation, the commissioner finds, in writing, that the violation has not been abated, the commissioner shall order a cessation of the person's surface coal mining operation or the portion of the operation relating to the violation.  The cessation order remains in effect until the commissioner determines that the violation has been abated or until it is modified, vacated, or terminated under (d) or (h) of this section.  The commissioner shall determine the steps necessary to abate the violation in the most expeditious manner possible and shall include the necessary measures in the cessation order issued under this section.

(c) A person who is or may be adversely affected by a notice of violation or cessation order issued under (a) or (b) of this section, or by a modification, vacation, or termination of the notice or order, may apply to the commissioner for review of the notice or order within 60 days after receipt of the notice or order by the operator or permittee or within 60 days after the modification, vacation, or termination of the notice or order. On receipt of the application, the commissioner shall provide for an investigation and an investigation report, as the commissioner considers appropriate.  At the request of the applicant or another person who is or may be adversely affected, the commissioner shall provide for a public hearing to enable the applicant to present information relating to the notice or order or the modification, vacation, or termination of the notice or order.  The filing of an application for review under this subsection may not operate as a stay of the order or notice.  The commissioner shall give the applicant and other interested persons written notice of the time and place of the hearing at least five days before the hearing. AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) applies to a hearing under this subsection except as provided by regulations adopted under this chapter.

(d) After any review under (c) of this section, the commissioner shall issue a written decision that includes findings of fact and an order vacating, affirming, modifying, or terminating the notice or order.  If the application for review under (c) of this section relates to a cessation order issued under (a) or (b) of this section, the commissioner shall issue the written decision within 30 days after receipt of the application for review unless the commissioner grants a request for temporary relief under (e) of this section.

(e) An applicant for review under (c) of this section may file with the commissioner a written request for temporary relief from a notice or order issued under (a) or (b) of this section before completion of the review of the notice or order.  The written request must include a detailed statement of the reasons in support of the request.  The commissioner shall expeditiously issue an order granting or denying the temporary relief.  If the applicant requests temporary relief from a cessation order issued under (a) or (b) of this section, the commissioner shall issue an order granting or denying the temporary relief within 10 days after the commissioner receives the written request.  The commissioner may grant the temporary relief under this subsection only

(1) after the commissioner holds a hearing in the locality of the permit area on the request for temporary relief in which the parties have an opportunity to be heard;

(2) if the applicant shows that there is substantial likelihood that the findings of the commissioner under (d) of this section will be favorable to the applicant; and

(3) if the temporary relief will not adversely affect the health or safety of the public or cause significant, imminent, environmental harm to land, air, or water resources.

(f) If, on the basis of an inspection, the commissioner has reason to believe that a pattern of violations of this chapter or of a term of a permit exists or has existed, and if the commissioner finds that the violations are caused by the unwarranted failure of the permittee to comply with the requirements or that the violations were wilfully caused by the permittee, the commissioner shall issue a notice of violation and an order to the permittee to, within a specified time period, show cause why the permit should not be suspended or revoked. The order to show cause must include notice to the permittee that a hearing may be requested within 30 days.

(g) If the permittee requests a hearing under (f) of this section, the commissioner shall inform the permittee and other known interested persons of the time, place, and date of the hearing.  AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) applies to a hearing under this subsection except as provided by regulations adopted under this chapter.  Within 60 days following the hearing or following the order to show cause if no hearing is requested, the commissioner shall issue and furnish to the permittee and all other parties to the hearing a written decision, order, and the reasons for both, concerning the suspension or revocation of the permit.  If the commissioner suspends or revokes the permit, the permittee shall immediately cease the surface coal mining operation on the permit area and shall complete the reclamation of the permit area within the time specified by the commissioner. If the permittee fails to complete the reclamation, the commissioner shall declare the performance bonds for the operation forfeited.

(h) A notice or order issued under this section shall state with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation, the abatement required, the period of time established for abatement, and a reasonable description of the portion of the operation to which the notice or order applies.  Each notice or order issued under this section must be given promptly to the alleged violator at the mine site unless the alleged violator has appointed an agent, in which case the agent may be served.  A notice or order issued under this section may be modified, vacated, or terminated by the commissioner.  A cessation order issued under (a) or (b) of this section expires not more than 30 days after the alleged violator receives actual notice of the order unless an informal conference is held as provided in regulations adopted under this chapter or unless the right to such a conference is waived by the alleged violator.  The commissioner shall hold the conference at a location that allows the permit area to be viewed during the conference.  The commissioner shall issue a written order affirming, modifying, vacating, or terminating the cessation order within five days of the conference. The holding of a conference or the waiver of it does not prejudice any other rights to administrative or judicial review provided under this chapter nor does it operate as a stay of a notice or order.

(i) Whenever an order is issued under this chapter, the commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, assess any party for the costs and attorney fees reasonably incurred by another party in connection with the order.

(j) The commissioner may request the attorney general to institute a civil action for relief, including a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other appropriate order, if a person

(1) violates an order or notice issued by the commissioner under this chapter;

(2) interferes with the commissioner carrying out the provisions of this chapter;

(3) unlawfully refuses to admit the commissioner into an operation;

(4) unlawfully refuses to permit inspection of an operation by the commissioner;

(5) fails to furnish information or a report requested by the commissioner under regulations adopted under this chapter; or

(6) refuses to permit access to or copying of records by the commissioner that the commissioner determines are reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.

(k) An action under (j) of this section shall be brought in the superior court in the judicial district in which the greater portion of the operation is located or in the judicial district where the operator's principal office is located. The superior court has jurisdiction to grant appropriate relief under (j) of this section. Relief granted by a superior court for a situation described in (j)(1) of this section continues in effect until the completion of proceedings for review of the notice or order under this section unless before that time the superior court modifies or sets aside the notice or order.

(l) In the case of a judicial proceeding to review an order or decision issued by the commissioner under this chapter, the court may, under conditions it may prescribe, grant the temporary relief it considers appropriate pending final determination of the proceedings if

(1) all parties to the proceedings have been notified and given an opportunity to be heard on a request for temporary relief;

(2) the person requesting the relief shows that there is a substantial likelihood that the person will prevail on the merits of the final determination of the proceeding; and

(3) the relief will not adversely affect the public health or safety or cause significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources.

(m) The commencement of a judicial proceeding to review an order or decision of the commissioner does not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the action, order, or decision of the commissioner.

(n) The fact that action of the commissioner is subject to judicial review in accordance with other provisions of state law may not be construed to limit the operation of the rights established in AS 27.21.950 except as provided in that section.

###### Sec. 27.21.250.   Penalties.

(a) The commissioner may assess a civil penalty against a person if the person or the person's operation violates a condition of a permit or a provision of this chapter.  If as a result of the violation the commissioner issues a cessation order under AS 27.21.240, the commissioner shall assess a civil penalty. The civil penalty may not exceed $5,000 for a violation.  The commissioner may consider each day of a continuing violation as a separate violation for the purposes of this subsection. In determining whether to assess and the amount of a civil penalty, the commissioner shall consider the person's history of previous violations at the site of the operation, the seriousness of the violation, including the irreparable harm done to the environment and the hazard created to the health or safety of the public, the person's negligence, and the good faith of the person in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after receiving notification of the violation.

(b) Within 30 days after issuing a notice or order under AS 27.21.240 to a person, the commissioner shall inform the person of the amount of the penalty.  The person notified of the penalty then has 30 days in which to pay the penalty in full or to contest either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation.  If the person wishes to contest either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation, the person may submit to the commissioner a bond equal to the penalty amount at the time the person files an application for review.  The bond shall be conditioned for the satisfaction of the penalty in full if the commissioner's determination of an occurrence of a violation and the assessment of a penalty are affirmed.  An application for review is effective when the bond is approved by the commissioner.  If the bond is not approved, the person charged with the penalty shall forward the proposed amount to the commissioner within 10 days of the disapproval of the bond for placement in an escrow account in order to make the petition effective.

(c) The commissioner shall assess a civil penalty under (a) of this section only after the person charged with a violation has been given an opportunity for a public hearing.  If a public hearing is held, the commissioner shall make findings of fact and shall issue a written decision relating to the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the civil penalty that is warranted. The written decision may order the person to pay the penalty. The commissioner may consolidate a hearing under this section with other proceedings under AS 27.21.240. AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) applies to a hearing under this subsection except as provided by regulations adopted under this chapter. If the person notified of a penalty does not request a public hearing, the commissioner may assess the penalty and order its payment only after the commissioner has determined that the person committed the violation and has determined the amount of the penalty that is warranted.

(d) A civil penalty owed under this section may be recovered in a civil action brought by the attorney general at the request of the commissioner.

(e) A person other than a corporation who wilfully and knowingly violates a condition of a permit, an order issued under AS 27.21.240, or an order incorporated in a final decision under this chapter, except an order incorporated in a decision issued under (c) of this section, is guilty of a class C felony.

(f) If a corporation violates a condition of a permit, an order issued under AS 27.21.240, or an order incorporated in a final decision issued by the commissioner under this chapter, except an order incorporated in a decision issued under (c) of this section, a director, officer, or agent of the corporation who wilfully and knowingly authorized, ordered, or carried out the violation is subject to a civil penalty under (a)§(d) of this section and is guilty of a class C felony.

(g) A person who knowingly makes a false statement, representation, or certification, or knowingly fails to make a required statement, representation, or certification in an application, record, report, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained under this chapter is guilty of a class C felony.

(h) A person who fails to correct a violation for which a notice of violation or a cessation order has been issued under AS 27.21.240 within the period or subsequent extension permitted for its correction shall be assessed a civil penalty of $750 for each day the failure or violation continues.  The period for correction continues until

(1) the entry of a final order by the commissioner in a review proceeding initiated by the alleged violator in which the commissioner orders, after an expedited hearing, the suspension of the abatement requirements of the notice or order after determining that the alleged violator will suffer irreparable loss or damage from the application of those requirements; or

(2) the entry of an order of the court in a review proceeding under AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) initiated by the alleged violator in which the court orders the suspension of the abatement requirements of the notice or order.

(i) A person who, except as permitted by law, wilfully resists, prevents, impedes, or interferes with the commissioner in the performance of duties under this chapter is guilty of a class C felony.

###### Sec. 27.21.260.   Areas unsuitable for surface coal mining.

(a) The commissioner shall use competent and scientifically sound data and information in order to make objective decisions as to which areas of land are unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal operations.  The decisions shall

(1) reflect the planning activities of federal, state, and municipal governments; and

(2) use a data base and inventory system that will permit the evaluation of areas of the state to support and permit reclamation of surface coal mining operations.

(b) A person or municipality having an interest that is or may be adversely affected may file a petition with the commissioner to designate an area as unsuitable for mining or to terminate a designation under this section.  The petition must contain allegations of facts with supporting evidence that would tend to establish the allegations.  Within three to seven months after receipt of a petition, the commissioner shall hold a public hearing in the locality of the area, under regulations adopted by the commissioner.  The commissioner may extend the time within which a hearing must be held if an extension is required to include a field season.  After the filing of a petition and before the hearing, other persons may intervene by filing allegations of fact with supporting evidence. Within 60 days after the hearing, the commissioner shall issue and furnish to the petitioner and intervenors a written decision regarding the petition and the reasons for the commissioner's decision.  The commissioner may cancel the hearing if the parties all agree to the cancellation.

(c) Upon receipt of a petition under (b) of this section, the commissioner

(1) shall designate an area as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations if the commissioner determines that reclamation in accordance with this chapter and regulations adopted under it is not technologically feasible in the area;

(2) may designate an area as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations if the commissioner determines that the operations in the area will

(A) be incompatible with existing state or local land use programs;

(B) affect fragile or historic land in which the operations could result in significant damage to important historic, cultural, scientific, and aesthetic values and natural systems;

(C) affect aquifer recharge areas or other renewable resource land in which the operations could result in a substantial loss or reduction of long-range productivity of water supply or food or fiber products; or

(D) affect areas subject to frequent flooding and areas of unstable geology, or other natural hazard land in which the operations could substantially endanger life and property.

(d) Subject to valid existing rights, the commissioner may not permit surface coal mining operations except those that existed on August 3, 1977,

(1) on any land within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge Systems, the National System of Trails, the National Wilderness Preservation System, the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, including study rivers designated under section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and National Recreation Areas designated by Act of Congress;

(2) that will adversely affect a publicly owned park or a place included in the National Register of Historic Sites unless approved jointly by the commissioner and the federal, state, or local agency that has jurisdiction over the park or the historic site;

(3) within 100 feet of the outside right-of-way line of any public road, except where mine access roads or haulage roads join the right-of-way line, and except that the commissioner may permit roads to be relocated or the area affected to lie within 100 feet of a road, if after public notice and opportunity for public hearing in the locality, a written finding is made that the interests of the public and the landowners affected by it will be protected; or

(4) within 300 feet from any occupied dwelling, unless waived by the owner of the dwelling, or within 300 feet of a public building, school, church, community, institutional building, or public park, or within 100 feet of a cemetery.

(e) Before designating an area as unsuitable under this section, the commissioner shall prepare a detailed statement of the potential coal resources of the area, the demand for coal resources, and the impact of the designation on the environment, the economy, and the supply of coal.

(f) Determinations of unsuitability of land for surface coal mining must consider present and future land use planning and regulation processes at the federal, state, and local levels.

(g) This section does not apply to land on which a surface coal mining operation was conducted on or before August 3, 1977, or under a permit issued under this chapter before a determination of unsuitability. This section does not apply to an area if a person had made substantial legal or financial commitments for an operation or proposed operation in that area before January 4, 1977.

(h) A designation of unsuitability under this section does not prevent coal exploration of any designated area.

(i) The commissioner shall adopt regulations to implement this section.

#### Article 3. Abandoned Mines.

###### Sec. 27.21.270.   Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund.

The commissioner may take the actions necessary to ensure state participation to the fullest extent practicable in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund created in 30 U.S.C. 1231 and to function as the state agency for that participation.  In conformity with the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, the commissioner shall

(1) by regulation, establish priorities that meet the terms of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 for the expenditure of money received by the commissioner from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund;

(2) designate land and water eligible for reclamation or abatement with money received by the commissioner from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund;

(3) submit reclamation plans, annual projects, and applications to the appropriate authorities under the terms of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977; and

(4) administer money received by the state for abandoned mine reclamation or related purposes from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund.

###### Sec. 27.21.280.   Eligible land and water.

Land and water eligible for reclamation or drainage abatement expenditures under this chapter are those that were mined for coal or were affected by such mining, wastebanks, coal processing, or other coal mining processes, and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status before August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under state or federal law.

###### Sec. 27.21.290.   Entry onto abandoned mine area.

(a) The commissioner may enter real property that has been adversely affected by past surface coal mining practices and other real property necessary for access to adversely affected real property to restore or reclaim the real property or to abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects.  The money expended for and the benefits accruing to the real property from work performed under this subsection is chargeable against the real property and mitigates or offsets a claim in or an action brought by an owner of an interest in the real property for damages resulting from the entry.  This subsection does not create new rights of action or eliminate existing immunities.

(b) The commissioner may enter real property for the purposes of conducting studies or exploratory work to determine the existence of adverse effects from past surface coal mining practices and to determine the feasibility of restoring or reclaiming the real property or abating, controlling, or preventing the adverse effects of past coal mining practices.

(c) The commissioner may enter real property under (a) or (b) of this section only after

(1) giving notice of the entry by mailing it to the owners if they are known or, if not known, by posting notice on the premises and advertising once a week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the land is located;

(2) making written findings that

(A) the land or water resources have been adversely affected by past coal mining practices;

(B) the adverse effects are at a stage that, in the public interest, action to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects of past coal mining practices should be taken; and

(C) the owners of the land or water resources where entry must be made to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects of past coal mining practices are not known or readily available or will not give permission for the entry.

###### Sec. 27.21.300.   Acquisition of abandoned mine areas.

(a) The commissioner may, by purchase, donation, or condemnation in accordance with AS 09.55.240§09.55.460, acquire real property that has been adversely affected by past surface coal mining practices if the commissioner determines that

(1) acquisition of the real property is necessary to the successful reclamation of the real property and is in the public interest; and

(2) the real property, after its restoration or reclamation or after the abatement, control, or prevention of the adverse effects, will serve recreational, historic, conservation, or reclamation purposes or will provide open space benefits; and

(3) permanent facilities will be constructed on the real property for the restoration or reclamation of the real property or for the abatement, control, or prevention of the adverse effects; or

(4) if the real property includes a coal refuse disposal site, the acquisition of the coal refuse disposal site and the coal refuse on the site will serve the purposes of this section; or

(5) public ownership is desirable to meet emergency situations created by the adverse effects and to prevent recurrences of the adverse effects.

(b) Title to real property acquired under this section is in the state.  If the commissioner acquires the real property by purchase or condemnation, the commissioner shall pay the fair market value of the real property as adversely affected by past coal mining practices.

(c) If real property acquired under this section is suitable for industrial, commercial, residential, or recreational development, the commissioner may sell the real property by competitive bidding, at not less than the fair market value of the real property.  The commissioner shall adopt regulations relating to the sale of real property under this subsection that will ensure that the use of the real property is consistent with any state and local land use plans.  If money received by the commissioner from the federal government is involved in the acquisition of the real property, the commissioner may sell the real property only if the sale is authorized by the Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior.  If a person requests it, the commissioner shall hold a hearing in the area in which the real property is located to consider the use or disposition of the real property after its restoration or reclamation or after the abatement, control, or prevention of adverse effects. The commissioner shall hold the hearing at a time that will afford local residents and representatives of municipal government in the area the maximum opportunity to participate in the hearing.  The commissioner shall publish notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the real property is located at least 10 days before holding the hearing.

###### Sec. 27.21.310.   Liens on abandoned mine areas.

(a) Within six months after the completion of a project under AS 27.21.290 to restore or reclaim privately owned real property or to abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects of past surface coal mining practice on privately owned real property, the commissioner shall itemize the money spent on the project.  If the project results or will result in a significant increase in the real property's fair market value, the commissioner may file a statement of the money spent in the recording office in the area in which the real property is located with a notarized appraisal by a licensed appraiser of the fair market value of the real property before the project began. The statement constitutes a lien on the real property as of the date of the expenditure which is second only to the lien of property taxes.  The lien may not exceed the amount determined by either of two appraisals to be the increase in the fair market value of the real property as a result of the project.  A lien may not be filed under this subsection against real property of a person who owned the surface before May 2, 1977, and who did not consent to, participate in, or exercise control over the surface coal mining operation that necessitated the project.

(b) A person affected by a lien under (a) of this section may petition the commissioner within 60 days after the recording of the lien for a hearing concerning the amount of the lien.

###### Sec. 27.21.320.   Filling voids and sealing tunnels.

The commissioner may authorize the filling of voids, sealing open and abandoned tunnels, shafts, and entryways resulting from any previous mining operation and reclaim surface impacts of underground and surface mines to the extent authorized by the Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior.

###### Sec. 27.21.330.   Emergency powers in abandoned mine areas.

(a) In emergency situations the commissioner may use money available to the state in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund for the purposes of AS 27.21.290(a) if the commissioner finds that

(1) an emergency exists that constitutes a danger to the public health, safety, or general welfare; and

(2) no other person or agency will act expeditiously for those purposes.

(b) If the commissioner makes the findings described in (a) of this section, the commissioner may enter on real property under AS 27.21.290(a) or (b) without giving the notice or making the findings required by AS 27.21.290(c).  An entry onto real property under this section may not be considered a condemnation of property or a trespass.

###### Sec. 27.21.340.   Miscellaneous powers regarding abandoned mine lands.

(a) The commissioner may request the attorney general to initiate, in addition to any other remedies provided for in this chapter, an action in equity for an injunction to restrain any interference with the exercise of the right to enter or to conduct the work described in AS 27.21.270§27.21.340.

(b) The state has the power and authority to construct and operate plants for the control and treatment of water pollution resulting from mine drainage, including major interceptors and other appurtenant facilities, so long as that control and treatment complies with 33 U.S.C. 1251§1376 (the Federal Water Pollution Control Act).

#### Article 4. General Provisions.

###### Sec. 27.21.900.   Mining by government agencies.

A federal, state, or municipal government agency, including a publicly owned utility or corporation, that proposes to engage in a surface coal mining operation that is subject to this chapter must comply with this chapter.

(3) as an incidental part of highway or other construction financed in whole or in part as specified by regulation, by federal, state, or municipal government agency.

###### Sec. 27.21.920.   Experimental practices.

In order to encourage advances in mining and reclamation practices, and to allow post-mining land use for industrial, commercial, residential, recreational, or public purposes, the commissioner may, with the approval of the Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior, authorize departures in individual cases on an experimental basis from the environmental performance standards established under AS 27.21.210.  The commissioner may authorize these departures if

(1) the experimental practices are, during and after the surface coal mining operation, potentially more protective of the environment than, or at least as protective of the environment as, those required by this chapter and regulations adopted under it;

(2) the surface coal mining operation for which the departure is authorized is not larger than necessary to determine the effectiveness and economic feasibility of the experimental practices; and

(3) the experimental practices do not reduce the protection afforded public health and safety below that provided by law or regulation.

###### Sec. 27.21.930.   Water rights and replacement.

(a) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to affect the right of a person to protect the person's interest in water resources affected by a surface coal mining operation.

(b) An operator shall replace the water supply of an owner of an interest in real property who obtains all or part of the owner's supply of water for domestic, agricultural, industrial, or other beneficial use from an underground or surface source, if the supply has been affected by contamination, diminution, or interruption proximately resulting from the operator's surface coal mining operation.

###### Sec. 27.21.940.   Certification of blasters.

(b) A person may not commence an action under (a)(1) of this section until 60 days after giving the commissioner written notice of the intended action in the manner prescribed by regulations adopted by the commissioner, except that an action may be brought immediately after the notice if the commissioner's failure to perform constitutes an imminent threat to the health or safety of the person or would immediately affect a legal interest of the person.

(c) A person may not commence an action under (a)(2) or (3) of this section

(1) until 60 days after the plaintiff has given notice in writing of the violation to the commissioner and to the agency, instrumentality, or alleged violator;

(2) if the state is diligently prosecuting a civil action in a state or federal court to require compliance with the provisions of this chapter or a regulation adopted or an order or permit issued under this chapter; however, any person may intervene in that civil action as a matter of right.

(d) A person may commence an action under this section only in the judicial district in which the surface coal mining operation is located.

(e) Nothing in this section restricts any right that a person or class of persons may have under statute or common law to seek enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter and the regulations adopted under it or to seek any other relief, including relief against the commissioner.

(f) A person who is injured or whose property is damaged by the violation by a permittee of a regulation adopted or an order or permit issued under this chapter may bring an action for damages, including reasonable attorney fees and expert witness fees, only in the judicial district in which the permittee's operation is located.  Nothing in this subsection affects the rights established by or limits imposed under AS 23.30.

(g) In an action under this section, the commissioner may intervene as a matter of right.

###### Sec. 27.21.960.   Inconsistencies with federal act.

(a) A provision of this chapter that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 as determined by the Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior under 30 U.S.C. 1255(b) is invalid from the date of the secretary's determination.

(b) If a provision of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 or of the regulations promulgated under that Act by the Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior is deleted, amended, set aside, enjoined, or declared invalid by Congress, the secretary, or in a final, unappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, then the commissioner shall review the changes made and make an appropriate recommendation as to whether changes in this chapter or the regulations adopted under it should be made.

###### Sec. 27.21.970.   Relationship to other laws.

(a) Nothing in this chapter abrogates or modifies the power of a state agency to enforce laws and regulations within its jurisdiction, except as specifically stated in this chapter and regulations adopted under it.  The commissioner shall coordinate permitting procedures to prevent unnecessary duplication in permit review.

## Chapter 22. Bonus for Discovery and Production.

###### Sec. 27.22.010.   Discovery and production bonus.

(a) To stimulate prospecting for, discovery of, and production from new domestic mineral-bearing deposits, and in the interest of the general industrial development of the state, the commissioner shall, upon sufficient proof, pay a bonus of $10,000 to a person or persons, partnership, company, or corporation that discovers and produces ore in Alaska under the terms of this chapter.

(b) The commissioner shall pay the bonus for the discovery and production from new domestic mineral-bearing deposits containing one or any combination of those minerals presently eligible for assistance under the Federal Office of Mineral Exploration program.  The production must be from a mining location of a lode or placer deposit that has not previously been discovered or worked.

###### Sec. 27.22.020.   Amount of production.

The bonus will be paid, not for discovery alone, but only in connection with the delivery and sale to a bona fide purchaser of the first unit shipment of ore or concentrate with a gross market value of $100,000 or more substantiated by affidavit showing completion of sale and receipt of money, gross or net, in hand of the claimant.

###### Sec. 27.22.030.   Eligibility to claim bonus.

A person of legal age and a citizen of the United States or a partnership, company, or corporation of citizens legally authorized to operate in the state may claim the bonus offered in this chapter.

###### Sec. 27.22.040.   Nature of bonus.

(a) A bonus will be paid only once for production of ores or concentrates from a single lode or placer deposit. The commissioner or a duly authorized representative shall determine whether production from a given location, claim, or group of claims is the first production from the deposit for the purpose of this chapter or whether the deposit has previously been discovered or worked for any of the minerals presently eligible for assistance under the Federal Office of Mineral Exploration program or any other metals or minerals, including gravel, not so listed, or whether production is such as to which a bonus has already been paid, or whether for any reason a bonus is not payable. In making the determination, the commissioner shall be guided by the federal or state mining laws, either of which is applicable, or both. The subdivision of a deposit into units to increase bonus payments will not be recognized in determining eligibility for bonus payments.

(b) The fact that a bonus has already been received will not prevent the payment of another bonus to the same person, partnership, company, or corporation with respect to production from a different deposit.

###### Sec. 27.22.050.   Notice of discovery and production; action of the commissioner.

(a) Notice of the discovery of a mineral deposit and production from it believed to meet the requirements of this chapter shall be forwarded to the commissioner by registered letter together with

(1) a brief description of the size, location, and date of discovery of the deposit, including the number, size, and location of mining claims and the name or names of the locators;

(2) the calendar dates during which the ore was mined and concentrate prepared;

(3) an affidavit and supporting documents showing completion of sale and receipt of at least $100,000, gross or net, in hand of the claimant.

(b) Upon receipt of the notice, the commissioner shall make or cause to be made the field investigations, including examination of the claimant's records and other pertinent data, to assure compliance with the expressed intent and purpose of this chapter.  If the claimant has fulfilled the necessary requirements as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner shall so certify and pay the bonus.

###### Sec. 27.22.060.   Definitions.

In this chapter,

(1) "commissioner" means the commissioner of natural resources;
