However, an individual who exercises the right to refuse treatment under this subsection may be responsible for paying all costs incurred by the state in seeking and implementing a quarantine or isolation order made necessary by a refusal of treatment by the individual. The department shall notify an individual who refuses treatment under this subsection that the refusal may result in an indefinite period of quarantine or isolation and that the individual may be responsible for payment of the costs of the quarantine or isolation.

###### Sec. 18.15.385.   Isolation and quarantine.

(a) The department may isolate or quarantine an individual or group of individuals if isolation or quarantine is the least restrictive alternative necessary to prevent the spread of a contagious or possibly contagious disease to others in accordance with regulations adopted by the department consistent with the provisions of this section and other law.

(b) The department shall adhere to the following conditions and standards when isolating or quarantining an individual or group of individuals:

(1) isolation and quarantine shall be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of a contagious or possibly contagious disease that poses a significant risk to public health; isolation and quarantine may include confinement to private homes or other private and public premises; absent exceptional circumstances that would jeopardize public health, a person shall be allowed to choose confinement in the person's home;

(2) isolated individuals shall be confined separately from quarantined individuals;

(3) the health status of an isolated or quarantined individual shall be monitored regularly to determine whether the individual continues to require isolation or quarantine;

(4) if a quarantined individual subsequently becomes infected or is reasonably believed to have become infected with a contagious or possibly contagious disease, the individual shall promptly be removed to isolation;

(5) the department shall immediately terminate an isolation and quarantine order when an individual poses no substantial risk of transmitting a contagious or possibly contagious disease to others.

(c) The department may authorize a health care practitioner, public health agent, or another person access to an individual in isolation or quarantine as necessary to meet the needs of the isolated or quarantined individual. An individual who enters isolation or quarantine premises with or without authorization of the department may be isolated or quarantined if needed to protect the public health.

(d) Before quarantining or isolating an individual, the department shall obtain a written order from the superior court authorizing the isolation or quarantine, unless the individual consents to the quarantine or isolation.

(e) Notwithstanding (d) of this section, when the department has probable cause to believe that the delay involved in seeking a court order imposing isolation or quarantine would pose a clear and immediate threat to the public health and isolation or quarantine is the least restrictive alternative and is necessary to prevent the spread of a contagious or possibly contagious disease, a state medical officer in the department may issue an emergency administrative order to temporarily isolate or quarantine an individual or group of individuals. An emergency administrative order of temporary quarantine or isolation by a state medical officer is enforceable by any peace officer in the state. Within 24 hours after implementation of the emergency administrative order, the department shall notify the superior court by filing a petition under (d) of this section that also alleges that the emergency action was necessary to prevent or limit the transmission of a contagious or possibly contagious disease to others that would pose an immediate threat to the public health. The petition must be signed by a state medical officer.

(f) An individual served with a petition under (d) of this section or an emergency administrative order to temporarily isolate or quarantine under (e) of this section has the right to a court hearing. The court shall hold a hearing within 48 hours after a petition is filed. The department may request a continuance of the hearing for up to five days. The court may grant the continuance for good cause shown and in extraordinary circumstances, giving due regard to the rights of the affected individuals, the protection of the public health, the severity of the need for isolation or quarantine, and other evidence. During a continuance, an isolated or quarantined individual shall remain in isolation or quarantine. The court may order the consolidation of individual claims into group claims if the number of individuals affected is so large as to render individual participation impractical, there are questions of law or fact common to the individual claims or rights to be determined, the group claims or rights are typical of the affected individuals' claims or rights, and the entire group can be adequately represented. The public shall be excluded from a hearing under this section unless the individual elects to have the hearing open under (g)(2) of this section.

(g) During the hearing, the individual has the right to

(1) view and copy all petitions and reports in the court file of the individual's case;

(2) elect to have the hearing open to the public;

(3) have the rules of evidence and civil procedure applied so as to provide for the informal but efficient presentation of evidence;

(4) have an interpreter if the individual does not understand English;

(5) present evidence on the individual's behalf;

(6) cross-examine witnesses who testify against the individual;

(7) call experts and other witnesses to testify on the individual's behalf; and

(8) participate in the hearing; under this paragraph, participation may be by telephone if the individual presents a substantial risk of transmitting a contagious or possibly contagious disease to others.

(h) At the conclusion of the hearing, the court may commit the individual to isolation or quarantine for not more than 30 days if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the isolation or quarantine is necessary to prevent or limit the transmission to others of a disease that poses a significant risk to the public health. The court may issue other orders as necessary. Orders are enforceable by a peace officer of this state. The order must

(1) identify the isolated or quarantined individual or group of individuals by name or shared or similar characteristics or circumstances;

(2) specify factual findings warranting isolation or quarantine under this section;

(3) include any conditions necessary to ensure that isolation or quarantine is carried out within the stated purposes and restrictions of this section; and

(4) be served on the affected individual or group of individuals in accordance with existing court rules.

(i) Before the expiration of an order issued under (h) of this section, the court may continue isolation or quarantine for additional periods not to exceed 30 days upon a showing by the department by clear and convincing evidence that the action is necessary to prevent or limit the transmission to others of a disease that poses a significant risk to the public health.

(j) An isolated or quarantined individual or group of individuals may apply to the court for an order to show cause why isolation or quarantine should not be terminated. The court shall rule on the application to show cause within 48 hours after filing. An isolated or quarantined individual or group of individuals may request a hearing in the court for remedies regarding breaches of the conditions of isolation or quarantine. A request for a hearing may not stay or enjoin an isolation or quarantine order. Where extraordinary circumstances justify the immediate granting of relief, the court shall fix a date for hearing on the alleged matters within 24 hours after receipt of the request. Otherwise, the court shall fix a date for hearing on the alleged matters within five days after receipt of a request.

(k) The provisions of this section apply to minors. All notices required to be served on an individual shall also be served on the parents or guardians of an individual who is an unemancipated minor.

(l) The department shall adopt regulations to protect, as much as possible, the privacy rights of individuals subject to isolation or quarantine under this section.

(m) The department may quarantine or isolate individuals who have been exposed to hazardous materials that can cause serious illness or injury by transmission of the hazardous material to others. The provisions of this section concerning isolation and quarantine of individuals to prevent the spread of contagious or possibly contagious diseases shall apply to isolation or quarantine of individuals who have been exposed to hazardous materials.

(n) A person who knowingly violates this section or a regulation adopted under this section is guilty of a class B misdemeanor. In this subsection, "knowingly" has the meaning given in AS 11.81.900(a).

(o) A person who intentionally violates this section or a regulation adopted under this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor. In this subsection, "intentionally" has the meaning given in AS 11.81.900(a).

(1) the abortion is performed by a physician licensed by the State Medical Board under AS 08.64.200;

(2) the abortion is performed in a hospital or other facility approved for the purpose by the Department of Health or a hospital operated by the federal government or an agency of the federal government;

(3) before an abortion is knowingly performed or induced on a pregnant, unmarried, unemancipated woman under 18 years of age, notice or consent have been given as required under AS 18.16.020 or a court has authorized the minor to proceed with the abortion without parental involvement under AS 18.16.030 and the minor consents; for purposes of enforcing this paragraph, there is a rebuttable presumption that a woman who is unmarried and under 18 years of age is unemancipated;

(4) the woman is domiciled or physically present in the state for 30 days before the abortion; and

(5) the applicable requirements of AS 18.16.060 have been satisfied.

(b) Nothing in this section requires a hospital or person to participate in an abortion, nor is a hospital or person liable for refusing to participate in an abortion under this section.

(c) A person who knowingly violates a provision of this section, upon conviction, is punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by imprisonment for not more than five years, or by both.

(d)  [Repealed,§6 ch 14 SLA 1997.]

(e) A person who performs or induces an abortion in violation of (a)(3) of this section is civilly liable to the pregnant minor and the minor's parents, guardian, or custodian for compensatory and punitive damages.

(f) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution or claim for a violation of (a)(3) of this section that the pregnant minor provided the person who performed or induced the abortion with false, misleading, or incorrect information about the minor's age, marital status, or emancipation, and the person who performed or induced the abortion did not otherwise have reasonable cause to believe that the pregnant minor was under 17 years of age, unmarried, or unemancipated.

(g) It is a defense to a prosecution or claim for violation of (a)(3) of this section that, in the clinical judgment of the physician or surgeon, compliance with the requirements of (a)(3) of this section was not possible because, in the clinical judgment of the physician or surgeon, an immediate threat of serious risk to the life or physical health of the pregnant minor from the continuation of the pregnancy created a medical emergency necessitating the immediate performance or inducement of an abortion. In this subsection,

(1) "clinical judgment" means a physician's or surgeon's subjective professional medical judgment exercised in good faith;

(2) "defense" has the meaning given in AS 11.81.900(b);

(3) "medical emergency" means a condition that, on the basis of the physician's or surgeon's good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant minor that

(A) an immediate abortion of the minor's pregnancy is necessary to avert the minor's death; or

(B) a delay in providing an abortion will create serious risk of medical instability caused by a substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant minor.

(h) A physician or other health care provider is liable for failure to obtain the informed consent of a person as required under AS 18.16.060 if the claimant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the provider has failed to inform the person of the common risks and reasonable alternatives to the proposed abortion procedure and that, but for that failure, the person would not have consented to the abortion procedure.

(i) It is a defense to any action for the alleged failure to obtain the informed consent of a person under (h) of this section that

(1) the risk not disclosed is too commonly known or is too remote to require disclosure; or

(2) the person who is the subject of the alleged failure to obtain the informed consent stated to the physician or other health care provider that the person would or would not undergo the abortion procedure regardless of the risk involved or that the person did not want to be informed of the matters to which the person would be entitled to be informed.

(j) In an action under (h) of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that an abortion was performed with the pregnant woman's informed consent if the person who performed the abortion submits into evidence a copy of the woman's written certification required under AS 18.16.060(b).

###### Sec. 18.16.020.   Notice or consent required before minor's abortion.

(a) A person may not knowingly perform or induce an abortion upon a minor who is known to the person to be pregnant, unmarried, under 18 years of age, and unemancipated unless, before the abortion, at least one of the following applies:

(1) either

(A) one of the minor's parents, the minor's legal guardian, or the minor's custodian has been given notice of the planned abortion not less than 48 hours before the abortion is performed, or

(B) the parent, legal guardian, or custodian has consented in writing to the performance or inducement of the abortion; if a parent has consented to the abortion the 48 hour waiting period referenced in (A) of this paragraph does not apply;

(2) a court issues an order under AS 18.16.030 authorizing the minor to consent to the abortion without notice or consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian, and the minor consents to the abortion;

(3) a court, by its inaction under AS 18.16.030, constructively has authorized the minor to consent to the abortion without notice and consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian, and the minor consents to the abortion; or

(4) the minor is the victim of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or a pattern of emotional abuse committed by one or both of the minor's parents or by a legal guardian or custodian of the minor and the abuse is documented by a declaration of the abuse in a signed and notarized statement by

(A) the minor; and

(B) another person who has personal knowledge of the abuse who is

(i) the sibling of the minor who is 21 years of age or older;

(ii) a law enforcement officer;

(iii) a representative of the Department of Family and Community Services who has investigated the abuse;

(iv) a grandparent of the minor; or

(v) a stepparent of the minor.

(b) In (a)(1) of this section, actual notice must be given or attempted to be given in person or by telephone by either the physician who has referred the minor for an abortion or by the physician who intends to perform the abortion. An individual designated by the physician may initiate the notification process, but the actual notice shall be given by the physician. The physician giving notice of the abortion must document the notice or attempted notice in the minor's medical record and take reasonable steps to verify that the person to whom the notice is provided is the parent, legal guardian, or custodian of the minor seeking an abortion. Reasonable steps to provide notice must include

(1) if in person, requiring the person to show government-issued identification along with additional documentation of the person's relationship to the minor; additional documentation may include the minor's birth certificate or a court order of adoption, guardianship, or custodianship;

(2) if by telephone, initiating the call, attempting to verify through a review of published telephone directories that the number to be dialed is that of the minor's parent, legal guardian, or custodian, and asking questions of the person to verify that the person's relationship to the minor is that of parent, legal guardian, or custodian; when notice is attempted by telephone but the physician or physician's designee is unsuccessful in reaching the parent, legal guardian, or custodian, the physician's designee shall continue to initiate the call, in not less than two-hour increments, for not less than five attempts, in a 24-hour period.

(c) If actual notice is attempted unsuccessfully after reasonable steps have been taken as described under (b) of this section, the referring physician or the physician intending to perform an abortion on a minor may provide constructive notice to the minor's parent, legal guardian, or custodian. Constructive notice is considered to have been given 48 hours after the certified notice is mailed. In this subsection, "constructive notice" means that notice of the abortion was provided in writing and mailed by certified mail, delivery restricted to addressee only, to the last known address of the parent, legal guardian, or custodian after taking reasonable steps to verify the mailing address.

(d) A physician who suspects or receives a report of abuse under this section shall report the abuse as provided under AS 47.17.020.

(e) A physician who is informed that the pregnancy of a minor resulted from criminal sexual assault of the minor must retain, and take reasonable steps to preserve, the products of conception and evidence following the abortion for use by law enforcement officials in prosecuting the crime.

###### Sec. 18.16.030.   Judicial bypass for minor seeking an abortion.

(a) A woman who is pregnant, unmarried, under 18 years of age, and unemancipated who wishes to have an abortion without notice to or the consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian may file a complaint in the superior court requesting the issuance of an order authorizing the minor to consent to the performance or inducement of an abortion without notice to or the consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian.

(b) The complaint shall be made under oath and must include all of the following:

(1) a statement that the complainant is pregnant;

(2) a statement that the complainant is unmarried, under 18 years of age, and unemancipated;

(3) a statement that the complainant wishes to have an abortion without notice to or the consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian;

(4) an allegation of either or both of the following:

(A) that the complainant is sufficiently mature and well enough informed to decide intelligently whether to have an abortion without notice to or the consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian; or

(B) that one or both of the minor's parents or the minor's guardian or custodian was engaged in physical abuse, sexual abuse, or a pattern of emotional abuse against the minor, or that the consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian otherwise is not in the minor's best interest;

(5) a statement as to whether the complainant has retained an attorney and, if an attorney has been retained, the name, address, and telephone number of the attorney.

(c) The court shall fix a time for a hearing on any complaint filed under (a) of this section and shall keep a record of all testimony and other oral proceedings in the action. The hearing shall be held at the earliest possible time, but not later than the fifth business day after the day that the complaint is filed. The court shall enter judgment on the complaint immediately after the hearing is concluded. If the hearing required by this subsection is not held by the fifth business day after the complaint is filed, the failure to hold the hearing shall be considered to be a constructive order of the court authorizing the complainant to consent to the performance or inducement of an abortion without notice to or the consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian, and the complainant and any other person may rely on the constructive order to the same extent as if the court actually had issued an order under this section authorizing the complainant to consent to the performance or inducement of an abortion without such consent.

(d) If the complainant has not retained an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the complainant.

(e) If the complainant makes only the allegation set out in (b)(4)(A) of this section and if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the complainant is sufficiently mature and well enough informed to decide intelligently whether to have an abortion, the court shall issue an order authorizing the complainant to consent to the performance or inducement of an abortion without the consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian. If the court does not make the finding specified in this subsection, it shall dismiss the complaint.

(f) If the complainant makes only the allegation set out in (b)(4)(B) of this section and the court finds that there is clear and convincing evidence of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or a pattern of emotional abuse of the complainant by one or both of the minor's parents or the minor's guardian or custodian, or by clear and convincing evidence the consent of the parents, guardian, or custodian of the complainant otherwise is not in the best interest of the complainant, the court shall issue an order authorizing the complainant to consent to the performance or inducement of an abortion without the consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian. If the court does not make the finding specified in this subsection, it shall dismiss the complaint.

(g) If the complainant makes both of the allegations set out in (b)(4) of this section, the court shall proceed as follows:

(1) the court first shall determine whether it can make the finding specified in (e) of this section and, if so, shall issue an order under that subsection; if the court issues an order under this paragraph, it may not proceed under (f) of this section; if the court does not make the finding specified in (e) of this section, it shall proceed under (2) of this subsection;

(2) if the court under (1) of this subsection does not make the finding specified in (e) of this section, it shall proceed to determine whether it can make the finding specified in (f) of this section and, if so, shall issue an order under that subsection; if the court does not make the finding specified in (f) of this section, it shall dismiss the complaint.

(h) The court may not notify the parents, guardian, or custodian of the complainant that the complainant is pregnant or wants to have an abortion.

(i) If the court dismisses the complaint, the complainant has the right to appeal the decision to the supreme court, and the superior court immediately shall notify the complainant that there is a right to appeal.

(j) If the complainant files a notice of appeal authorized under this section, the superior court shall deliver a copy of the notice of appeal and the record on appeal to the supreme court within four days after the notice of appeal is filed. Upon receipt of the notice and record, the clerk of the supreme court shall place the appeal on the docket. The appellant shall file a brief within four days after the appeal is docketed. Unless the appellant waives the right to oral argument, the supreme court shall hear oral argument within five days after the appeal is docketed. The supreme court shall enter judgment in the appeal immediately after the oral argument or, if oral argument has been waived, within five days after the appeal is docketed. Upon motion of the appellant and for good cause shown, the supreme court may shorten or extend the maximum times set out in this subsection. However, in any case, if judgment is not entered within five days after the appeal is docketed, the failure to enter the judgment shall be considered to be a constructive order of the court authorizing the appellant to consent to the performance or inducement of an abortion without notice to or the consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian, and the appellant and any other person may rely on the constructive order to the same extent as if the court actually had entered a judgment under this subsection authorizing the appellant to consent to the performance or inducement of an abortion without notice to or the consent of another person. In the interest of justice, the supreme court, in an appeal under this subsection, shall liberally modify or dispense with the formal requirements that normally apply as to the contents and form of an appellant's brief.

(k) Each hearing under this section, and all proceedings under (j) of this section, shall be conducted in a manner that will preserve the anonymity of the complainant. The complaint and all other papers and records that pertain to an action commenced under this section, including papers and records that pertain to an appeal under this section, shall be kept confidential and are not public records under AS 40.25.110§40.25.120.

(l) The supreme court shall prescribe complaint and notice of appeal forms that shall be used by a complainant filing a complaint or appeal under this section. The clerk of each superior court shall furnish blank copies of the forms, without charge, to any person who requests them.

(m) A filing fee may not be required of, and court costs may not be assessed against, a complainant filing a complaint under this section or an appellant filing an appeal under this section.

(n) Blank copies of the forms prescribed under (l) of this section and information on the proper procedures for filing a complaint or appeal shall be made available by the court system at the official location of each superior court, district court, and magistrate in the state. The information required under this subsection must also include notification to the minor that

(1) there is no filing fee required for either form;

(2) no court costs will be assessed against the minor for procedures under this section;

(3) an attorney will be appointed to represent the minor if the minor does not retain an attorney;

(4) the minor may request that the superior court with appropriate jurisdiction hold a telephonic hearing on the complaint so that the minor need not personally be present;

(5) the minor may request that the superior court with appropriate jurisdiction issue an order directing the minor's school to excuse the minor from school to attend court hearings held under this section and to have the abortion if one is authorized by the court and directing the school not to notify the minor's parent, legal guardian, or custodian that the minor is pregnant, seeking an abortion, or is absent for purposes of obtaining an abortion.

###### Sec. 18.16.040.   Reports.

For each month in which an abortion is performed on a minor by a physician, the physician shall file a report with the Department of Health indicating the number of abortions performed on a minor for that month, the age of each minor, the number of previous abortions performed on each minor, if any, and the number of pregnancies of each minor, if any, and the number of consents provided under each of the exceptions enumerated under AS 18.16.020(a)(1)§(4). A report filed under this section may not include identifying information of the minor other than the minor's age.

###### Sec. 18.16.050.   Partial-birth abortions.

(2) information about the nature and risks of undergoing or not undergoing the proposed procedure that a reasonable patient would consider material to making a voluntary and informed decision of whether to undergo the procedure.

(c) The information required in (b) of this section shall be provided before the procedure in a private setting to protect privacy, maintain the confidentiality of the decision, ensure that the information focuses on the individual circumstances, and ensure an adequate opportunity to ask questions. Provision of the information telephonically or by electronic mail, regular mail, or facsimile transmittal before the person's appointment satisfies the requirements of this subsection as long as the person whose consent is required under (a) of this section has an opportunity to ask questions of the physician after receiving the information.

(d) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, informed consent that meets the requirements of (a)§(c) of this section is not required in the case of a medical emergency or if the pregnancy is the result of sexual assault under AS 11.41.410§11.41.427, sexual abuse of a minor under AS 11.41.434§11.41.440, incest under AS 11.41.450, or an offense under a law of another jurisdiction with elements similar to one of these offenses. In this subsection, "medical emergency" means a condition that, on the basis of a physician's good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman that

(1) the immediate termination of the woman's pregnancy is necessary to avert the woman's death; or

The affirmative votes of not less than two of the public members and two commissioners are required for the passage of any motion or resolution.  Notice of all meetings shall be given in accordance with regulations adopted by the board.

The bonds, notes, or attached interest coupons must be executed by manual or facsimile signatures of the officers of the authority designated by the board.  Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, the authority may issue interim receipts or certificates which shall be exchanged for the definitive bonds.

(e) The bond resolution shall provide for the establishment of one or more special funds, and those funds may be under the control of the board or one or more trustees.  The bond resolution shall obligate the authority to deposit and expend the proceeds of the revenue bonds only into and from those funds.  The authority may issue and sell revenue bonds payable as to interest and principal only out of those funds.

(f) All bonds may be sold at public or private sale in the manner, at the time, and for the price determined by the authority.

(g) Before the issuance of any bonds, the authority shall verify that the lease or operator agreement for the medical facility being financed by that issue is at least sufficient, in the judgment of the authority,

(3) to meet all obligations in connection with the lease or operator agreement, including all costs necessary to service the bonds.

In the discretion of the authority, an issue of bonds may be secured by a trust indenture, trust agreement, indenture of mortgage or deeds of trust (all considered "trust agreements" in this chapter) between the authority and a corporate trustee. The corporate trustee may be a trust company, bank, or national banking association, with corporate trust powers, located inside or outside the state or by a secured loan agreement or other instrument or under a resolution giving powers to a corporate trustee by means of which the authority may

(1) make any covenants and agreements with the trustee or the holders of the bonds that the authority determines to be necessary or desirable, including, without limitation, covenants and agreements as to

Neither the members of the authority nor any person executing the bonds is liable personally on the bonds or is subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of them.

###### Sec. 18.26.120.   Bondholder claims against special funds.

Any notes or revenue bonds issued against any special funds provided for in this chapter are a valid claim of the holder of them only as against those special funds in the proportion or amount of the revenue pledged to the funds and other authority assets the board may have pledged.  All notes or revenue bonds payable from a special fund shall, on the face of the note or revenue bond, name the fund and the resolution creating them.

###### Sec. 18.26.130.   Conflict of interests.

(a) A member of the board may not vote on a resolution of the board relating to a lease or contract to be entered into by the authority under this chapter if the member is a party to the lease or contract or has a direct ownership or equity interest in a firm, partnership, corporation, or association that would be a party to the contract or lease.

(b) It is a conflict of interests for any person employed by the authority or any person on contract for hire, written or oral, at a fixed or hourly fee with the authority, to act in an advisory capacity to the authority or to support the use of the authority's funds in a manner that may or will result in benefit, directly or indirectly, to that employee, agent, or advisor, except upon full disclosure in writing and by oral presentation to the board of the details of the conflicting interest, including a dollar estimate of the direct and indirect monetary gain the employee, agent, or advisor may expect to derive.  The board's resolution that addresses the matter in which a conflict of interests exists must set out the details of the full disclosure.

The pledge must be noted in the board's minute book and is constructive notice to all parties. Neither the resolution nor other instrument by which a pledge is created need be otherwise recorded, nor is the filing of any financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code or other law required to perfect the pledge. Revenue, rent, or other money, obligations, or assets so pledged and later received by the authority are immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery or further act.

###### Sec. 18.26.150.   Obligations and income of authority.

(a) Notes or revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter are not, either directly, indirectly, or contingently, an obligation, a pledge of the faith and credit of, or a charge upon any revenue or funds of the state or of any political subdivision of the state but are payable solely from the funds of the authority.  The issuance of notes or revenue bonds under this chapter does not, directly, indirectly, or contingently, obligate the state or any political subdivision of the state to levy any form of taxation or to make any appropriation for their payment.  Nothing in this section prevents the authority from pledging its faith and credit or the faith and credit of a medical facility to the payment of bonds authorized under this chapter.

(b) The funds, income, or receipts of the authority do not constitute money of the state, nor is real property in which the authority has an interest considered land owned in fee by the state or to which the state may become entitled or in any way land belonging to the state, or state land referred to in art. VIII of the Alaska Constitution.

###### Sec. 18.26.160.   Rights of bondholders.

A holder of notes or revenue bonds issued under this chapter or a trustee under a trust agreement entered into under this chapter may, except to the extent the holder's rights are restricted by the bond resolution, by any suitable form of legal proceedings, protect and enforce any rights under the laws of this state or granted by the bond resolution.  Those rights include (1) the right to compel the performance of all duties of the authority required by this chapter or the bond resolution; (2) the right to enjoin unlawful activities; and (3) in the event of default (A) with respect to the payment of any principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any bond, or (B) in the performance of any covenant or agreement on the part of the authority in the bond resolution, the right to apply to a court having jurisdiction of the cause to appoint a receiver to administer and operate the medical facility.  The receiver may pay principal of, and premiums, if any, and interest on those bonds, and has the powers, subject to the direction of the court, that are permitted by law and are accorded receivers in general equity cases. However, the receiver may not pledge additional revenue of the authority to the payment of that principal, premium, and interest.

###### Sec. 18.26.190.   Pledge of the state.

The State of Alaska pledges to and agrees with the holders of any obligations issued under this chapter, and with those parties who may enter into contracts with the authority under this chapter, that the state will not limit or alter the rights vested in the authority by this chapter with respect to outstanding obligations until those obligations, together with the interest on them, are fully met and discharged and those contracts are fully performed on the part of the authority. However, nothing in this section precludes such a limitation or alteration if adequate provision is made by law for the protection of the holders of those obligations of the authority or persons entering into those contracts with the authority.

###### Sec. 18.26.200.   Accounting and reports.

The authority shall keep an accurate account of all of its activities and of all of its receipts and expenditures and shall biennially, no later than the 10th day of the first regular session of each legislature, make a report of them to the governor, copies of which shall also be made available to bondholders or parties holding a secured interest in the assets of the authority. The authority shall notify the legislature that the report is available. The governor may investigate the affairs of the authority, may examine the property and records of the authority, and may prescribe methods of accounting and the rendering of periodical reports in relation to projects undertaken by the authority.

###### Sec. 18.26.210.   State requirements.

A medical facility that has been monetarily supported, in any manner whatsoever, by the authority is subject to any state requirements relating to public buildings, structures, grounds, works, or improvements, any requirement of competitive bidding or other restriction imposed on the procedure for award of contracts, or the lease, sale, or other disposition of property of the authority.

(2) the existence of these slum and blighted areas contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, necessitating excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime prevention, correction, prosecution, punishment, and the treatment of juvenile delinquency and for the maintenance of adequate police, fire, and accident protection and other public services and facilities, and constitutes an economic and social liability, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of municipalities, and retards the provisions of housing accommodations;

(3) this menace is beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory process in the exercise of the police power and cannot be dealt with effectively by the ordinary operations of private enterprise without the aids provided in AS 18.55.480§18.55.960;

(4) the elimination of slum conditions or conditions of blight, the acquisition and preparation of land in or necessary to the redevelopment of slum or blighted areas and its sale or lease for development or redevelopment in accordance with comprehensive plans and redevelopment plans of municipalities, and any assistance that may be given by any public body in connection therewith are public uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and private property acquired; and

(5) the necessity in the public interest for the provisions of AS 18.55.480§18.55.960 is a matter for legislative determination.

The planning commission shall submit its written recommendations with respect to the proposed redevelopment plan to the corporation within 30 days after receipt of the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the planning commission or, if recommendations are not received within 30 days, then without the recommendations, the corporation may recommend the redevelopment plan to the governing body of the municipality for approval.

The notice must describe the time, place, and purpose of the hearing and must generally identify the area to be redeveloped under the plan.  At the public hearing all interested parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to express their views respecting the proposed redevelopment plan.

(i) Following the hearing required by (h) of this section, the governing body may by ordinance initially approve a redevelopment plan if it finds that the plan is feasible and conforms with the general plan for the physical development of the area. Approval of subsequent modifications of the plan that do not involve substantive changes shall be by resolution. A redevelopment plan that has not been approved by the governing body when recommended by the corporation may again be recommended to it with any modifications considered advisable.

However, the sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer, or an agreement relating to it, may be made only after, or subject to, the approval of the redevelopment plan by the governing body of the municipality. The real property shall be sold, leased, or transferred at its fair value for uses in accordance with the redevelopment plan although the fair value may be less than the cost of acquiring and preparing the property for redevelopment. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the redevelopment plan, the corporation shall consider the uses and purposes required by the redevelopment plan, the restrictions upon, and the covenants, conditions, and obligations assumed by the redeveloper of the property, the objectives of the redevelopment plan for the prevention of the recurrence of slum or blighted areas, and the other matters the corporation specifies as appropriate. In fixing rentals and selling prices, the corporation shall consider appraisals of the property for these uses that are made by land experts employed by the corporation.

The notice must identify the area and must state that the further information that is available may be obtained at the office of the corporation. The corporation shall consider all redevelopment proposals and the financial and legal ability of the prospective redevelopers to carry out their proposals and may negotiate with redevelopers for proposals for the purchase or lease of real property in the redevelopment project area. The corporation may accept the redevelopment contract proposal it considers in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of AS 18.55.480§18.55.960, provided that the corporation has given to the governing body at least 30 days' written notice of its intent to accept the redevelopment contract proposal. Thereafter the corporation may execute a redevelopment contract in accordance with the provisions of (a) of this section and deliver deeds, leases, and other instruments and take all steps necessary to effectuate the redevelopment contract. The corporation may, without regard to the foregoing provisions of this subsection, dispose of real property in a redevelopment project area to private redevelopers for redevelopment under the reasonable competitive bidding procedures it prescribes, subject to the provisions of (a) of this section.

(c) The corporation may temporarily operate and maintain real property in a redevelopment project area pending the disposition of the property for redevelopment, without regard to the provisions of (a) and (b) of this section, for uses and purposes that it considers desirable even though not in conformity with the redevelopment plan.

(d) A person owning land in the urban renewal area at the time of the approval of the urban renewal plan by the governing body of the municipality may, with approval of the governing body and under regulations, conditions, and limitations the corporation prescribes, be granted a preferred right to purchase or lease land within the redevelopment area. This preferred right shall be exercised within 15 days after public notice of the date of the intended leasing or sale of land within the area.  Public notice shall be given in substantially the manner set forth in (a) of this section.

###### Sec. 18.55.550.   Eminent domain.

###### Sec. 18.55.560.   Acquisition and development of undeveloped vacant land.

Upon a determination, by resolution, of the governing body of the municipality that the acquisition and development of undeveloped vacant land not within a slum or blighted area is essential to the proper clearance or redevelopment of a slum or blighted area or a necessary part of the general slum clearance program of the municipality, the acquisition, planning, preparation for development or disposal of the land shall constitute a redevelopment project that may be undertaken by the corporation in the manner provided in AS 18.55.480§18.55.960. The determination by the governing body is a substitute for the declaration required by AS 18.55.530(b) but the determination may not be made until the governing body finds that

(1) there is a shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the municipality;

(2) the undeveloped vacant land will be developed for predominantly residential uses; and

(b) The members of the board of directors of the corporation or a person executing the bonds or notes authorized by (a) of this section are not liable personally on the bonds or notes by reason of the issuance of them. The bonds, notes, and other obligations of the corporation are not a debt of the municipality, the state, or the United States, and neither the municipality, the state, nor the United States is liable on them, nor are the bonds, notes, or obligations payable out of money or property other than those of the corporation acquired for the purposes of AS 18.55.480§18.55.960 and each bond and note shall state this on its face. A bond or note does not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction. Bonds and notes of the corporation issued under AS 18.55.480§18.55.960 are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and, together with interest on them and income from them, are exempt from all taxes.

Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, bonds and notes issued under AS 18.55.480§18.55.960 are negotiable.

(f) In an action or proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of a bond or note or security for a bond or note issued under AS 18.55.480§18.55.960, where the bond or note recites in substance that it has been issued by the corporation to aid in financing a redevelopment project, the bond or note is conclusive proof that it has been issued for that purpose and the project is conclusively considered to have been planned, located, and carried out in accordance with the purposes and provisions of AS 18.55.480§18.55.960.

The property sold, leased, or otherwise transferred by the corporation may be assessed for taxation on that part of the tax year during which it was not owned by the corporation, unless the property is exempt from taxation by law. Except for the payments required by this subsection, the power vested in the corporation to make payments in lieu of taxes under AS 18.55.250 or other law is not affected by this subsection.

#### Article 1. Alaska Housing Finance Corporation.

## Chapter 56. Alaska Housing Finance Corporation.

###### Sec. 18.56.010.   Findings and purpose.

(a) There exists within the state a serious shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary residential housing available at low or moderate prices or rentals to persons of lower and moderate income.  There also exist within the state remote, underdeveloped, or blighted areas where the development of decent, safe, and sanitary housing is necessary to economic growth. These conditions are inimical to the safety, health, welfare, and prosperity of the residents of the state and to the sound growth of urban and rural communities.

(b) The legislature finds and declares that private enterprise has not been able to provide, without assistance, an adequate supply of safe and sanitary homes at prices or rents that persons of lower or moderate income can afford, or to achieve rehabilitation of much of the present housing for persons of lower and moderate income, or to provide without assistance the housing necessary to promote the economic growth of remote, underdeveloped, or blighted areas, and that existing state and federal programs are inadequate to meet housing needs of persons of lower and moderate income or of remote, underdeveloped, or blighted areas.  It is imperative that the supply of housing for persons of lower and moderate income and the housing necessary to promote the economic growth of remote, underdeveloped, or blighted areas be increased and that coordination and cooperation among private enterprise, state and local government be encouraged to sponsor, build, and rehabilitate residential housing for these persons.

(c) The legislature finds and declares further that, in accomplishing this purpose, the creation of the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation is essential to assist in the acquisition and development of land and the construction, rehabilitation, financing, management, maintenance, sale, and rental of dwelling units for persons of lower and moderate income or persons in remote, underdeveloped, or blighted areas and that these activities serve a public purpose in benefiting the people of the state. The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation is empowered to act on behalf of the state and its people in serving this public purpose for the benefit of the general public.

(d) The program of making loans for residential housing to veterans in accordance with AS 26.15 has increased and improved the supply of adequate housing in the state, and the continuation of the program is essential to the economic growth of the state and the expansion of the supply of adequate residential housing in the state. Participation by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation in the program of purchasing and insuring state veterans' loans as provided in this chapter will be of material aid in insuring the continuance of the program of making loans for residential housing to veterans in accordance with AS 26.15.

(e) Expansion of the program of the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation of purchasing insured and uninsured mortgage loans is essential to the economic growth of the state and the supply of adequate residential housing in the state.

(f) The legislature finds that enabling the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation to assist in financing the program of veterans' loans for residential housing in accordance with AS 26.15 and to expand its program of purchasing other mortgage loans serves a public purpose in benefiting the people of the state.  The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation is empowered to act on behalf of the state and its people in serving this public purpose for the benefit of the general public.

(g) The legislature finds that permitting the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation to create a subsidiary to assist in the financing of prepayment of all or a portion of a governmental employer's share of unfunded accrued actuarial liability of retirement systems serves a public purpose in benefiting the people of the state. The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation may act on behalf of the state and its people in serving this public purpose for the benefit of the general public.

###### Sec. 18.56.093.   Insurance.

(a) There is established in the corporation the housing insurance fund, the rural housing hazard insurance fund, and the rural housing title insurance fund.  The funds shall be completely segregated from all other funds of the corporation, and are trust funds for the uses and purposes of this section.  The corporation may adopt regulations under AS 18.56.088 and enter into agreements with respect to the exercise of any power relating to the funds under this section, including, without limitation, agreements as to the use of the money in the funds, agreements with respect to the terms and conditions upon which payments from the funds must be made to the corporation with respect to mortgage loans insured under this section, agreements as to accounts or subaccounts in the funds for different categories of loans, and agreements regarding the payment of and security for bonds of the corporation.  The corporation may pledge, assign, or grant other interests in the funds as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with the insurance of mortgage loans and to provide for the payment of and security for bonds of the corporation.

(b) In addition to any other fees and charges that the corporation may charge on mortgage loans, the corporation may collect, or cause to be collected, insurance commitment fees and insurance premiums on mortgage loans insured by a fund under this section.

(c) A mortgage loan purchased by the corporation as part of its special mortgage loan purchase program may be insured by the housing insurance fund, and a mortgage loan on a mobile home or residence located in a remote, underdeveloped, blighted, or rural area of the state may also be insured (1) against hazard loss by the rural housing hazard insurance fund when hazard insurance from other sources satisfactory to private mortgage lenders is not, in the opinion of the corporation, available on reasonable terms, and (2) against title defect by the rural housing title insurance fund when title insurance from other sources satisfactory to private mortgage lenders is not, in the opinion of the corporation, available on reasonable terms.  The endorsement of the corporation on the mortgage that it is insured by any fund under this section at the time of purchase or acquisition of the mortgage loan is conclusive evidence that the mortgage loan is insured under the provisions of this section by the fund.

(d) Mortgage loans may be insured by a fund or an account in a fund under this section only when the amount in the fund or in the account as a percentage of the sum of all mortgage loans to be insured and all unpaid principal on mortgage loans to be insured by the fund or the account equals or exceeds the fund requirement.  The fund requirement for each fund or account shall be calculated as the percentage that the corporation determines is actuarially sound for operation of the fund or account.

(e) When the corporation determines what is actuarially sound with respect to the operation of each fund or account in a fund, it shall consider means of providing sufficient revenue for the operation of the fund or account, without regard to amounts that may have been or may, after the date of determination of actuarial soundness, be appropriated under (f) of this section and it shall consider factors which must include, without limitation,

(1) as to the mortgages insured by the housing insurance fund, or an account of the housing insurance fund, estimates of future defaults and losses on mortgage loans insured under this section based on actual default and loss experience on those mortgage loans or on similar mortgage loans in this state or elsewhere, estimates of recoveries on defaulted or foreclosed mortgage loans based on that experience, the terms and conditions of the mortgage loans insured under this section, estimates of earnings and income of amounts on deposit in the fund, and any other appropriate factors;

(2) as to mortgages insured by the rural housing title insurance fund, estimates of defaults and losses by reason of title defects that are otherwise uninsured, estimates of earnings and income of amounts of deposit in the fund or the account, and any other appropriate factors; and

(3) as to mortgages insured by the rural housing hazard insurance fund, or an account of the rural housing hazard insurance fund, estimates of default by reason of hazard losses which are otherwise uninsured, estimates of earnings and income of amounts on deposit in the fund or the account, and any other appropriate factors.

(f) On December 1 of each year the corporation shall ascertain the amount on deposit in each fund established under this section and in each account of each fund.  If the amount in any fund or account is less than the fund requirement for the fund or account, the corporation shall, no later than January 2 of the following year, certify in writing to the governor and to the legislature, the amount, if any, required to restore that fund or account to the fund requirement.  The legislature may appropriate the amount and the corporation shall deposit in the fund or account all amounts appropriated during the then current state fiscal year.  Nothing in this subsection creates a debt or liability of the state.

###### Sec. 18.56.095.   Mortgage insurance.

(a) There is a special fund of the state to be known as the "state mortgage insurance fund" (called the "mortgage insurance fund") which shall be completely segregated and set apart from all other funds of the state, and which is a trust fund for the uses and purposes of this section and into and from which money shall be paid as provided in this section. The mortgage insurance fund shall be held by the commissioner of revenue, subject to the power of the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development to enter into and perform agreements with respect to the use of money in the mortgage insurance fund and to pledge, assign, or grant interests in the mortgage insurance fund as provided in this section.  The commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development may enter into agreements with the corporation with respect to the exercise of any power or approval relating to the mortgage insurance fund under this section, including, without limitation, agreements as to the use of money in the mortgage insurance fund, agreements with respect to the terms and conditions upon which payments from the mortgage insurance fund shall be made to the corporation with respect to mortgage loans insured under this section, and agreements regarding the payment of and security for mortgage insurance bonds, and in connection with these agreements the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development may pledge, assign, or grant other interests in the mortgage insurance fund to the corporation as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with the insurance of mortgage loans and to provide for the payment of and security for mortgage insurance bonds.  Any such agreement or any of the rights of the corporation under the agreement and payments received or to be received under the agreement may be pledged or assigned by the corporation for the benefit of the holders of mortgage insurance bonds.

(b) In addition to any other fees and charges that the corporation may charge on mortgage loans, it may collect or cause to be collected on all mortgage loans made or purchased with the proceeds of the sale of mortgage insurance bonds, either or both a special mortgage loan insurance commitment fee or a mortgage loan insurance premium.  The special mortgage loan insurance commitment fees and special mortgage loan insurance premiums when received shall be deposited in the mortgage insurance fund by the corporation, or by any mortgage loan servicer, trustee, or agent designated by the corporation to receive them, and shall be held, invested and, together with all investment income derived from them, reinvested by the commissioner of revenue as set out in AS 37.10.071, subject to any agreement with the corporation under (a) of this section.

(c) If, at any time after receipt by the corporation of a payment from the mortgage insurance fund with respect to a mortgage loan or any portion of the principal and interest and other amounts payable on a mortgage loan, the corporation recovers an amount on the mortgage loan or portion of it from any source other than the mortgage insurance fund, it shall apply the amount recovered in the following order: first to repay the general fund of the state to the extent of appropriations made pursuant to requests made under (f) of this section, and second, to repay the mortgage insurance fund.

(d) A mortgage loan may be insured if the loan-to-value ratio at the time of the insurance loan does not exceed 80 percent or, if the loan-to-value ratio does exceed that percentage, if it is federally insured or guaranteed or insured by a qualified mortgage insurance company to the extent of the excess.  The endorsement of the corporation on the mortgage at the time of purchase or acquisition of the mortgage loan is conclusive evidence that the mortgage loan is insured under the provisions of this section. The insurance is payable solely from the mortgage insurance fund.

(e) Mortgage loans may only be insured when the amount in the mortgage insurance fund as a percentage of the sum of all mortgage loans to be insured and all unpaid principal on mortgage loans insured by the corporation equals or exceeds the fund requirement. As used in this section, the fund requirement is calculated as follows as to the following mortgage loans insured by the corporation:

(1) in the case of federally insured or guaranteed mortgage loans, or mortgage loans insured by a qualified mortgage insurance company or, if not so insured or guaranteed, with a loan-to-value ratio at the time of the mortgage insurance application less than 80 percent, the greater of (A) two percent of the unpaid principal amount of those mortgage loans, or (B) a percentage that the corporation with the approval of the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development determines is actuarially sound for operation of the mortgage insurance fund;

(2)  [Repealed,§77 ch 106 SLA 1980.]

(f) On December 1 of each year the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development shall determine the amount on deposit in the mortgage insurance fund.  If the amount in the fund is less than the fund requirement, the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development shall request the corporation to transfer from any available funds the amount necessary to restore the mortgage insurance fund to the fund requirement and the corporation shall promptly comply with the request from any funds available subject to agreements with holders of any of its obligations.  If sufficient funds are not provided as the result of the requests, the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development shall, no later than January 2 of the following year, make and deliver to the governor and to the chairmen of the house and senate finance committees a certificate stating the sum required to restore the fund to the fund requirement and the sum so certified may be appropriated and paid to the fund during the then current state fiscal year.  Nothing in this subsection creates a debt or liability of the state.

(g)  [Repealed,§77 ch 106 SLA 1980.]

(h) In this section, unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning,

(1) the determination of what is "actuarially sound" with respect to the operation of the mortgage insurance fund shall be based on a consideration of the factors that will provide sufficient revenue for the operation of the fund, without regard to amounts that may have been or may, after the date of determination of actuarial soundness, be appropriated pursuant to (f) of this section, including, without limitation, estimates of future defaults and losses on mortgage loans insured under this section based on actual default and loss experience on those mortgage loans or on similar mortgage loans in this state or elsewhere, estimates of recoveries on defaulted or foreclosed mortgage loans based on that experience, the terms and conditions of the mortgage loans insured under this section, estimates of earnings and income of amounts on deposit in the mortgage insurance fund, and any other appropriate factors;

(2) "loan-to-value ratio" means the ratio between the principal amount of a mortgage loan and the appraised value, as determined by the corporation, of the residential housing financed by the mortgage loan;

(3) "mortgage insurance bond" means a bond, note, or other obligation of the corporation, the proceeds of which are authorized to be expended to purchase or make a mortgage loan insured under this section;

(B) if the cost of funds of that issue is more than 10 percent, the interest rate may not be less than 10 percent;

(2) an interest rate determined under this subsection on the loan amount eligible for assistance of a mortgage loan that is not purchased from the proceeds of bonds that are qualified veterans' mortgage bonds under the applicable provisions of 26 U.S.C. (Internal Revenue Code) shall be reduced by one percentage point if the loan is made to an eligible veteran under  AS 18.56.101;

(3) the interest rate for the amount of a mortgage loan purchased under (a) of this section that exceeds the loan amount eligible for assistance is equal to the cost of funds to the corporation attributable to that part of the loan;

(4) the interest rate on the loan amount eligible for assistance of a mortgage loan purchased with money that is not the proceeds of either taxable or tax-exempt bonds is the rate the corporation determines is appropriate by application of the provision of (1) of this subsection;

(5) the interest rate on the loan amount eligible for assistance of a mortgage loan purchased from the proceeds of bonds that are exempt from taxation, other than bonds that constitute qualified veterans' bonds under (h) of this section, is equal to the interest rate determined under (1) and (2) of this subsection on a loan purchased under (a) of this section from the proceeds of the most recent applicable issue of taxable bonds sold by the corporation; a higher or lower interest rate shall be established on the entire loan amount if required to ensure the tax-exempt status of the bonds;

(6) the corporation shall determine the interest rate on a mortgage loan that is an adjustable rate mortgage loan as provided in this subsection; the corporation shall recalculate the interest rate from time to time based on changes in the cost to the corporation of the funds used to purchase the adjustable rate mortgage loan; however, the corporation may establish a minimum interest rate applicable to an adjustable rate mortgage loan, and the interest rate on the adjustable rate mortgage loan may not be less than the minimum interest rate so established regardless of the cost of funds to the corporation;

(7) for loans made under this section, the corporation shall give effect to interest rate changes applicable to the loans based on time of loan application, time of issuance of the corporation's bonds issued to purchase loans, or other factors as the corporation determines;

Any income or interest earned by, or increment to, a capital reserve fund, due to the investment of the fund or any other amounts in it, may be transferred by the corporation to other funds or accounts of the corporation to the extent that the transfer does not reduce the amount of the capital reserve fund below the capital reserve fund requirement.

(c) In computing the amount of a capital reserve fund for the purpose of this section, securities in which all or a portion of the funds are invested shall be valued at par or, if purchased at less than par, at amortized costs as the term is defined by resolution of the corporation authorizing the issue of the obligations, or by some other reasonable method established by the corporation by resolution.

(e) The chairman of the corporation shall annually, no later than January 2, make and deliver to the governor and chairmen of the house and senate finance committees a certificate stating the sum, if any, required to restore any capital reserve fund to the capital reserve fund requirement. The legislature may appropriate that sum, and all sums appropriated during the then current fiscal year by the legislature for the restoration shall be deposited by the corporation in the proper capital reserve fund. Nothing in this section creates a debt or liability of the state.

## Chapter 57. Regional Electrical Authorities.

###### Sec. 18.57.010.   Finding and purpose.

The legislature finds that an acute shortage of adequate, safe, reliable electrical facilities exists in the rural areas of the state and that adequate electrical systems cannot be provided by the private sector due to inadequate projected system revenues and economic depression in certain areas or by local governments of the state since the boundaries required for boroughs under  art. X,§3, of the Alaska Constitution and the boundaries of cities necessary to effectively operate as cities would, in many cases, not be adequate to provide economic, adequate, safe, and reliable electrical service. The legislature further finds that adequate housing, public facilities, and economic development are heavily dependent upon adequate, safe, and reliable electrical facilities. These conditions are inimical to the safety, health, welfare, and prosperity of the residents of the state and to the sound growth of rural communities.  The legislature further finds that a reasonable means of accomplishing the purpose of providing adequate, safe, and reliable systems is the creation of regional electrical authorities that are not local governments.  It is the purpose and intent of the legislature to provide a means whereby public corporations to serve as regional electrical authorities may be formed.

###### Sec. 18.57.020.   Creation of authorities.

(a) An association authorized by AS 18.55.996(a) to form a regional housing authority is given the authority to form a regional electrical authority.

Each authority may exercise all powers conferred by this chapter.

(b) A regional electrical authority may not transact business or exercise powers granted to it until the governing body of the association has, by resolution, declared there is a need for the authority to function, given it the authority to function, and appointed persons to serve as the board of commissioners of the authority.  The number of members of the board of commissioners, their terms of office, and the filling of vacancies in office shall be determined by resolution of the governing body of the association.

(c) The regional electrical authority has jurisdiction to operate in all or part of the operating area of the individual association as determined by resolution of the governing body of the association.  The governing body may, by resolution, add to or subtract from the area served.  The authority may operate within the service area of a certificated rural electrical cooperative or within the corporate limits of a municipality only with consent, by resolution, of the governing body of the municipality or cooperative; however, if an authority is operating within an area that becomes part of a municipality or has a certificate of convenience and necessity from the former Alaska Public Utilities Commission or the Regulatory Commission of Alaska to operate in an area that becomes part of a municipality, consent is not necessary.

(d) A municipality, electrical cooperative, or other provider of electrical service may transfer all or part of its electrical system including, without limitation, lands and rights in land, equipment, and certificates or franchises, to a regional electrical authority by resolution of the governing board upon terms agreed upon with the authority; however, approval by resolution of the board of commissioners of the authority shall be obtained.  Unless otherwise provided by law other approvals to transfers are not required.

###### Sec. 18.57.030.   Tax exemption.

A parent or guardian may file a petition on behalf of a minor.

(b) When a petition for a protective order is filed, the court shall schedule a hearing and provide at least 10 days' notice to the respondent of the hearing and of the respondent's right to appear and be heard, either in person or through an attorney. If the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that the respondent has committed stalking or sexual assault against the petitioner, regardless of whether the respondent appears at the hearing, the court may order any relief available under (c) of this section. The provisions of a protective order issued under this section are effective for one year unless earlier dissolved by the court.

(c) A protective order issued under this section may

(1) prohibit the respondent from threatening to commit or committing stalking or sexual assault;

(2) prohibit the respondent from telephoning, contacting, or otherwise communicating directly or indirectly with the petitioner or a designated household member of the petitioner specifically named by the court;

(3) direct the respondent to stay away from the residence, school, or place of employment of the petitioner, or any specified place frequented by the petitioner; however, the court may order the respondent to stay away from the respondent's own residence, school, or place of employment only if the respondent has been provided actual notice of the opportunity to appear and be heard on the petition;

(1) make reasonable efforts to ensure that the order is understood by the petitioner and by the respondent, if present; and

(2) have the order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement agency for expedited service.

(e) A court may not deny a petition for a protective order solely because

(1) there is a lapse of time between an act of sexual assault and the filing of the petition;

(2) the stalking or act of sexual assault was the basis for a previous protective order; or

(3) a court previously found that the petitioner was a victim of stalking or sexual assault but declined to order relief under this section, if the petition alleges a change in circumstances since the court's previous finding.

If the court finds that the petition establishes probable cause that the crime of stalking or sexual assault has occurred, that it is necessary to protect the petitioner from further stalking or sexual assault, and that the petitioner has certified to the court in writing the efforts, if any, that have been made to provide notice to the respondent, the court shall ex parte and without notice to the respondent issue a protective order. An ex parte protective order under this section may grant the protection allowed by AS 18.65.850(c).

The request may be made orally or in writing based on the sworn statement of a peace officer, and in person or by telephone. If the court finds probable cause to believe that the petitioner is in immediate danger of stalking or sexual assault based on an allegation of the recent commission of stalking or sexual assault, the court ex parte shall issue an emergency protective order.

An ex parte protective order expires 20 days after it is issued unless dissolved earlier by the court at the request of either the petitioner or the respondent and after notice and, if requested, a hearing. If a court issues an ex parte protective order, the court shall have the order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement agency for expedited service and for entry into the central registry of protective orders under AS 18.65.540.

The request may be made orally or in writing based upon the sworn statement of a peace officer, and in person or by telephone. If the court finds probable cause to believe that the victim is in immediate danger of domestic violence based on an allegation of the recent commission of a crime involving domestic violence, the court ex parte shall issue an emergency protective order. In an emergency protective order, the court may grant the protection provided by AS 18.66.100(c)(1)§(5), (8), (10), (11), and (16). An emergency protective order expires 72 hours after it is issued unless dissolved earlier by the court at the request of the petitioner.

(c) A peace officer who obtains an emergency protective order under (b) of this section shall

(1) place the provisions of an oral order in writing on a form provided by the court and file the written order with the issuing court by the end of the judicial day after it was issued;

(2) provide a copy of the order to the petitioner;

(3) serve a copy of the order on the respondent; and

(4) comply with the requirements of AS 18.65.540 for ensuring that the order is entered into the central registry of protective orders under AS 18.65.540.

(b) If a request for a modification is made under this section and the respondent raises an issue not raised by the petitioner, the court may allow the petitioner additional time to respond.

(c) If the court modifies a protective order under this section, it shall issue a modified order and shall

(1) make reasonable efforts to ensure that the order is understood by the petitioner and by the respondent, if present at the hearing; and

(2) have the order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement agency for expedited service and for entry into the central registry of protective orders under AS 18.65.540.

(b) A court may not grant protective orders against the petitioner and the respondent in the same action under this chapter.

(c) A court may not order parties into mediation or refer them to mediation for resolution of the issues arising from a petition for a protective order under AS 18.66.100§18.66.180.

(2) "If you are ordered to have no contact with the petitioner or to stay away from the petitioner's residence, vehicle, or other place designated by the court, an invitation by the petitioner to have the prohibited contact or to be present at or enter the residence, vehicle, or other place does not in any way invalidate or nullify the order."

(e) A protective order issued under this chapter is in addition to and not in place of any other civil or criminal remedy. A petitioner is not barred from seeking an order under AS 18.66.100§18.66.180 because of the existence of another civil action between the petitioner and respondent.

(4) to the provider of a service under AS 18.67.110(b).

(b) For the purposes of this chapter, a person is considered to have intended an act notwithstanding that by reason of age, insanity, drunkenness, or otherwise, the person was legally incapable of forming a criminal intent.

(c) In determining whether to make an order under this section, the board shall consider all circumstances determined to be relevant, including provocation, consent, or any other behavior of the victim that directly or indirectly contributed to the victim's injury or death, the prior case or social history, if any, of the victim, the victim's need for financial aid, and any other relevant matters. In applying this subsection,

(1) the board may not deny an order based on the factors in this subsection, unless those factors relate significantly to the occurrence that caused the victimization and are of such a nature and quality that a reasonable or prudent person would know that the factors or actions could lead to the crime and the victimization;

(2) with regard to circumstances in which the victim consented to, provoked, or incited the criminal act, the board may consider those circumstances only if the board finds that it is more probable than not that those circumstances occurred and were the cause of the crime and the victimization;

(3) the board may deny an order based on the victim's involvement with illegal drugs, only if

(A) the victim was involved in the manufacture or delivery of a controlled substance at the time of the crime or the crime and victimization was a direct result of the prior manufacture or delivery of a controlled substance; the evidence of this manufacture or delivery must be corroborated by law enforcement or other credible sources; and

(B) the evidence shows a direct correlation linking the illegal activity and the crime and victimization; or

(4) if a claim is based on a crime involving domestic violence or on a crime of sexual abuse of a minor or sexual assault and the offender is

(A) convicted of one of those crimes, notwithstanding (1)§(3) of this subsection, the board may not deny an order based on considerations of provocation, the use of alcohol or drugs by the victim, or the prior social history of the victim; or

(B) not convicted of one of those crimes, the board may not deny an order based on the involvement or behavior of the victim.

(d) An order may be made under this section whether or not a person is prosecuted or convicted of an offense arising out of the act that caused the injury or death involved in the application. Upon application made by an appropriate prosecuting authority, the board may suspend proceedings under this chapter for a period it considers appropriate on the ground that a prosecution for an offense arising out of the act that caused the injury or death involved in the application has been commenced or is imminent.

(b) If, within the period allowed, a hearing is conducted and a decision is reached under AS 18.80.120 and 18.80.130, the decision of the commission is binding on the parties to the court action as to all issues resolved in the hearing but not as to any issues not resolved in the hearing.

(c) When proceedings in the superior court are deferred for a hearing and decision under this section, the plaintiff may proceed, after the decision of the commission, as an aggrieved party for the purpose of obtaining judicial review under AS 18.80.135, whether or not the person was a party to, or complainant in, the administrative proceedings.

(b) Subject to the provisions of AS 18.85.155, the attorney services and facilities and the court costs shall be provided at public expense to the extent that the person, at the time the court determines indigency, is unable to provide for payment without undue hardship. Appointment of any guardian ad litem or attorney shall be made under the terms of AS 25.24.310, to the extent that that section is not inconsistent with the requirements of this chapter.

(c) An indigent person is entitled to representation under (a) and (b) of this section for purposes of bringing a timely application for post-conviction relief under AS 12.72. An indigent person is not entitled to representation under (a) and (b) of this section for purposes of bringing

Representation in connection with the hearing may include investigation and other preparation before the hearing is held as well as representation at the hearing.

If a person who was represented by the Public Defender Agency at public expense without a court order in connection with a hearing held under AS 47.10.142(d) is not later determined to be eligible for court-appointed counsel at public expense under applicable laws and court rules, the court shall assess against the represented person the cost to the Public Defender Agency of providing the representation.

Payments made under this subsection shall be paid into the state general fund.
