If at death the justice or judge was not yet entitled to retirement pay, or was or would have been entitled to less than 60 percent of the monthly salary authorized for the office, the surviving spouse is entitled to monthly survivors' benefits equal to 30 percent of the salary authorized for justices or judges, respectively, at the time each monthly payment is made.
