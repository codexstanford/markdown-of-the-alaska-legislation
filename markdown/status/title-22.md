In an action brought under this subsection, the court may grant relief as to any act, practice, or policy of the defendant which is prohibited by AS 18.80, regardless of whether each act, practice, or policy, with respect to which relief is granted, directly affects the plaintiff, so long as a class or members of a class of which the plaintiff is a member are or may be aggrieved or injured by the act, practice, or policy.

If at death the justice or judge was not yet entitled to retirement pay, or was or would have been entitled to less than 60 percent of the monthly salary authorized for the office, the surviving spouse is entitled to monthly survivors' benefits equal to 30 percent of the salary authorized for justices or judges, respectively, at the time each monthly payment is made.
