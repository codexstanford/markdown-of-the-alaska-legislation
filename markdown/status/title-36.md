(B) the rates of wages in fact received by laborers, mechanics, or field surveyors.

###### Sec. 36.05.080.   Failure to pay agreed wages.

Every contract within the scope of AS 36.05.070 must contain a provision that if it is found that a laborer, mechanic, or field surveyor employed by the contractor or subcontractor has been or is being paid a rate of wages less than the rate of wages required by the contract to be paid, the state or its political subdivision may, by written notice to the contractor, terminate the contractor's right to proceed with the work or the part of the work for which there is a failure to pay the required wages and to prosecute the work to completion by contract or otherwise, and the contractor and the contractor's sureties are liable to the state or its political subdivision for excess costs for completing the work.

###### Sec. 36.05.090.   Payment of wages from withheld payments and listing contractors who violate contracts.

If the accrued payments withheld under the contract are insufficient to reimburse all the laborers, mechanics, or field surveyors with respect to whom there has been a failure to pay the wages required under AS 36.05.070, the laborers, mechanics, or field surveyors have the right of action or intervention or both against the contractor and the contractor's sureties conferred by law upon persons furnishing labor or materials, and in the proceedings it is not a defense that the laborers, mechanics, or field surveyors accepted or agreed to accept less than the required rate of wages or voluntarily made refunds.

###### Sec. 36.05.110.   Contracts entered into without advertising.

The fact that a public construction contract authorized by law is entered into upon a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee basis or otherwise, without advertising for proposals, does not make AS 36.05.070ยง36.05.110 inapplicable if those sections are otherwise applicable to the contract.

## Chapter 10. Employment Preference.

###### Sec. 36.10.005.   Legislative findings.

(a) The legislature finds that

(1) because of its unique climate and its distance from the contiguous states, the state has historically suffered from unique social, seasonal, geographic, and economic conditions that result in an unstable economy;

(2) the unstable economy is a hardship on the residents of the state and is aggravated by the large numbers of seasonal and transient nonresident workers;

(3) the rate of unemployment among residents of the state is one of the highest in the nation;

(4) the state has one of the highest ratios of nonresident to resident workers in the nation;

(5) the state has a compelling interest in reducing the level of unemployment among its residents;

(6) the construction industry in the state accounts for a substantial percentage of the available employment;

(7) construction workers receive a greater percentage of all unemployment benefits paid by the state than is typical of other states;

(8) historically, the rate of unemployment in the construction industry in the state is higher than the rate of unemployment in other industries in the state;

(9) it is appropriate for the state to consider the welfare of its residents when it funds construction activity;

(10) it is in the public interest for the state to allocate public funds for capital projects in order to reduce unemployment among its resident construction workers;

(11) the influx of nonresident construction workers contributes to or causes the high unemployment rate among resident construction workers because nonresident workers compete with residents for the limited number of available construction jobs;

(12) nonresident workers displace a substantial number of qualified, available, and unemployed Alaska workers on jobs on state funded public works projects;

(13) the state has a special interest in seeing that the benefits of state construction spending accrue to its residents;

(14) the natural resources of land owned by the state belong to the citizens of the state;

(15) Alaskans have chosen to use the majority of the royalties derived from the state's natural resources to fund state government;

(16) the vast majority of the state's revenue is derived from natural resource income rather than from other forms of taxation;

(17) because the state has no personal income tax or sales tax, nonresident workers use services provided by the state but do not contribute fairly to the costs of those services; and

(18) Alaskans, more than the residents of other states, suffer economically when nonresidents displace qualified residents since resident workers contribute local taxes as well as their share of the royalties from natural resources.

(b) The legislature further finds that

(1) the state and its political subdivisions, when acting as a market participant in funding public works projects, should give Alaska residents an employment preference to promote a more stable economy;

(2) the state and its political subdivisions have a duty of loyalty to their citizens and should fulfill this duty by giving residents preference for employment on public works projects they fund;

(3) there is a legitimate and compelling governmental interest and that the public health and welfare will suffer if state residents are not afforded employment preference in state-funded construction-related work.

(c) The legislature finds that the following factors are reasonable but not exclusive indicators of the ratio of nonresident to resident employees in the state:

(1) the ratio of applicants for unemployment insurance who list out-of-state residences to applicants who list residences in the state;

(2) the ratio of employees who are subject to unemployment insurance coverage and who did not apply for or were denied a permanent fund dividend to employees who were found eligible for a dividend.

(d) The legislature finds that

(1) the number of state residents who are unable to find work is considerably higher than is reflected by unemployment rates based on nationally accepted measures;

(2) many rural state residents who wish to work do not seek employment as frequently as necessary to meet federal definitions of unemployment because of continuing lack of employment opportunities in rural areas of the state.

###### Sec. 36.10.006.   Statement of purpose. [Repealed,ยง16 ch 20 SLA 2002.]

###### Sec. 36.10.007.   State policy.

It is the policy of this state that, to fulfill the duty of loyalty owed to its citizens and to remedy social or economic problems, the state will grant an employment preference to residents when the state is acting as a market participant.

(a) A public agency shall include in a construction-related professional services contract entered into by the public agency a provision under which the consultant agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the public agency from claims or liability for the negligent acts, errors, or omissions of the consultant. The provision must include an apportionment of the indemnification, defense, and hold harmless obligation on a comparative fault basis.

(b) A provision that reads substantially as follows satisfies the requirement of (a) of this section:

The consultant shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the contracting agency from and against any claim of, or liability for, negligent acts, errors, and omissions of the consultant under this agreement. The consultant is not required to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless the contracting agency for a claim of, or liability for, the independent negligent acts, errors, and omissions of the contracting agency. If there is a claim of, or liability for, a joint negligent act, error, or omission of the consultant and the contracting agency, the indemnification, defense, and hold harmless obligation of this provision shall be apportioned on a comparative fault basis. In this provision, "consultant" and "contracting agency" include the employees, agents, and contractors who are directly responsible, respectively, to each. In this provision, "independent negligent acts, errors, and omissions" means negligence other than in the contracting agency's selection, administration, monitoring, or controlling of the consultant, or in approving or accepting the consultant's work.

(1) "construction" means the process of building, altering, repairing, maintaining, improving, demolishing, planning, and designing a public highway, a structure, a building, a utility, infrastructure, or another public improvement to real property, but does not mean the routine operation of a public improvement;
