This process shall be repeated until the contract is completed.

###### Sec. 36.05.020.   Basis for determining wage.

A subcontract that is performed on public construction may be reduced to a basis of day labor for the purpose of determining whether or not the subcontractor or contractors have paid at not less than the prevailing scale of wage.

###### Sec. 36.05.030.   Authority; investigations; hearings; regulations; enforcement.

###### Sec. 36.05.045.   Notice of work and completion; withholding of payment.

(a) Before commencing work on a public construction contract, the person entering into the contract with a contracting agency shall designate a primary contractor for purposes of this section.

The notice of work must list work to be performed under the public construction contract by each contractor who will perform any portion of work on the contract and the contract price being paid to each contractor. The primary contractor shall pay all filing fees for each contractor performing work on the contract, including a filing fee based on the contract price being paid for work performed by the primary contractor's employees. The filing fee payable shall be the sum of all fees calculated for each contractor. The filing fee shall be one percent of each contractor's contract price. The total filing fee payable by the primary contractor under this subsection may not exceed $5,000.

(b) Upon completion of all work on the public construction contract, the primary contractor shall file with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development a notice of completion together with payment of any additional filing fees owed due to increased contract amounts. Within 30 days after the department's receipt of the primary contractor's notice of completion, the department shall inform the contracting agency of the amount, if any, to be withheld from the final payment.

(c) A contracting agency

(1) may release final payment on a public construction contract to the extent that the agency has received verification from the Department of Labor and Workforce Development that

(d) The notice and filing fee required under (a) of this section may be filed after work has begun if

(1) the public construction contract is for work undertaken in immediate response to an emergency; and

(2) the notice and fees are filed not later than 14 days after the work has begun.

(4) the state or a political subdivision shall withhold so much of the accrued payments as is necessary to pay to laborers, mechanics, or field surveyors employed by the contractor or subcontractors the difference between

(A) the rates of wages required by the contract to be paid laborers, mechanics, or field surveyors on the work; and

(B) the rates of wages in fact received by laborers, mechanics, or field surveyors.

###### Sec. 36.05.080.   Failure to pay agreed wages.

Every contract within the scope of AS 36.05.070 must contain a provision that if it is found that a laborer, mechanic, or field surveyor employed by the contractor or subcontractor has been or is being paid a rate of wages less than the rate of wages required by the contract to be paid, the state or its political subdivision may, by written notice to the contractor, terminate the contractor's right to proceed with the work or the part of the work for which there is a failure to pay the required wages and to prosecute the work to completion by contract or otherwise, and the contractor and the contractor's sureties are liable to the state or its political subdivision for excess costs for completing the work.

###### Sec. 36.05.090.   Payment of wages from withheld payments and listing contractors who violate contracts.

(a) The state disbursing officer in the case of a state public construction contract and the local fiscal officer in the case of a political subdivision public construction contract shall pay directly to laborers, mechanics, or field surveyors from accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contract the wages due laborers, mechanics, or field surveyors under AS 36.05.070.

(b) The state disbursing officer or the local fiscal officer shall distribute to all departments of the state government and to all political subdivisions of the state a list giving the names of persons who have disregarded their obligations to employees.  A person appearing on this list and a firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which the person has an interest may not work as a contractor or subcontractor on a public construction contract for the state or a political subdivision of the state until three years after the date of publication of the list.  If the accrued payments withheld under the contract are insufficient to reimburse all the laborers, mechanics, or field surveyors with respect to whom there has been a failure to pay the wages required under AS 36.05.070, the laborers, mechanics, or field surveyors have the right of action or intervention or both against the contractor and the contractor's sureties conferred by law upon persons furnishing labor or materials, and in the proceedings it is not a defense that the laborers, mechanics, or field surveyors accepted or agreed to accept less than the required rate of wages or voluntarily made refunds.

###### Sec. 36.05.110.   Contracts entered into without advertising.

The fact that a public construction contract authorized by law is entered into upon a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee basis or otherwise, without advertising for proposals, does not make AS 36.05.070§36.05.110 inapplicable if those sections are otherwise applicable to the contract.

## Chapter 10. Employment Preference.

###### Sec. 36.10.005.   Legislative findings.

(a) The legislature finds that

(1) because of its unique climate and its distance from the contiguous states, the state has historically suffered from unique social, seasonal, geographic, and economic conditions that result in an unstable economy;

(2) the unstable economy is a hardship on the residents of the state and is aggravated by the large numbers of seasonal and transient nonresident workers;

(3) the rate of unemployment among residents of the state is one of the highest in the nation;

(4) the state has one of the highest ratios of nonresident to resident workers in the nation;

(5) the state has a compelling interest in reducing the level of unemployment among its residents;

(6) the construction industry in the state accounts for a substantial percentage of the available employment;

(7) construction workers receive a greater percentage of all unemployment benefits paid by the state than is typical of other states;

(8) historically, the rate of unemployment in the construction industry in the state is higher than the rate of unemployment in other industries in the state;

(9) it is appropriate for the state to consider the welfare of its residents when it funds construction activity;

(10) it is in the public interest for the state to allocate public funds for capital projects in order to reduce unemployment among its resident construction workers;

(11) the influx of nonresident construction workers contributes to or causes the high unemployment rate among resident construction workers because nonresident workers compete with residents for the limited number of available construction jobs;

(12) nonresident workers displace a substantial number of qualified, available, and unemployed Alaska workers on jobs on state funded public works projects;

(13) the state has a special interest in seeing that the benefits of state construction spending accrue to its residents;

(14) the natural resources of land owned by the state belong to the citizens of the state;

(15) Alaskans have chosen to use the majority of the royalties derived from the state's natural resources to fund state government;

(16) the vast majority of the state's revenue is derived from natural resource income rather than from other forms of taxation;

(17) because the state has no personal income tax or sales tax, nonresident workers use services provided by the state but do not contribute fairly to the costs of those services; and

(18) Alaskans, more than the residents of other states, suffer economically when nonresidents displace qualified residents since resident workers contribute local taxes as well as their share of the royalties from natural resources.

(b) The legislature further finds that

(1) the state and its political subdivisions, when acting as a market participant in funding public works projects, should give Alaska residents an employment preference to promote a more stable economy;

(2) the state and its political subdivisions have a duty of loyalty to their citizens and should fulfill this duty by giving residents preference for employment on public works projects they fund;

(3) there is a legitimate and compelling governmental interest and that the public health and welfare will suffer if state residents are not afforded employment preference in state-funded construction-related work.

(c) The legislature finds that the following factors are reasonable but not exclusive indicators of the ratio of nonresident to resident employees in the state:

(1) the ratio of applicants for unemployment insurance who list out-of-state residences to applicants who list residences in the state;

(2) the ratio of employees who are subject to unemployment insurance coverage and who did not apply for or were denied a permanent fund dividend to employees who were found eligible for a dividend.

(d) The legislature finds that

(1) the number of state residents who are unable to find work is considerably higher than is reflected by unemployment rates based on nationally accepted measures;

(2) many rural state residents who wish to work do not seek employment as frequently as necessary to meet federal definitions of unemployment because of continuing lack of employment opportunities in rural areas of the state.

###### Sec. 36.10.006.   Statement of purpose. [Repealed,§16 ch 20 SLA 2002.]

###### Sec. 36.10.007.   State policy.
