(d) Facts stated in a recorded certificate of a public official in affidavit form or under the seal of the official's office and derived from information or documents obtained or kept by the official as part of official duties are presumed to be true.

(e) If presumptions created by this section are inconsistent, the presumption applies that is founded upon weightier consideration of policy and logic. If these considerations are of equal weight, neither presumption applies.
