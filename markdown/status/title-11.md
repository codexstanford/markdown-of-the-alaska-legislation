(b) In a prosecution under this section,

(1) it is not a defense

(b) If an offender commits the crime of conspiracy and knows that a person with whom the offender conspires to commit a serious felony offense has conspired or will conspire with another person or persons to commit the same serious felony offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring with that other person or persons to commit that crime whether or not the offender knows their identities.

(b) In this section, "overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy" has the meaning given in AS 11.31.120.

###### Sec. 11.31.140.   Multiple convictions barred.

###### Sec. 11.81.410.   Justification: Use of force by guards.

(a) In addition to using force justified under other sections of this chapter, a guard or peace officer employed in a correctional facility may, if authorized by regulations adopted by the Department of Corrections, use nondeadly force upon another person when and to the extent reasonably necessary and appropriate to maintain order.

(b) Except as provided in (c) of this section, a guard or peace officer employed in a correctional facility or a peace officer in the immediate vicinity of a correctional facility at the time of an escape from the facility may use deadly force when and to the extent the guard or peace officer reasonably believes it necessary to terminate the escape or attempted escape of a prisoner from the correctional facility.

(c) The use of deadly force under (b) of this section is not justified if the guard or peace officer knows that the prisoner was under official detention in the correctional facility on a charge of a misdemeanor and does not believe that the prisoner is armed with a firearm, in which event only nondeadly force may be used.

###### Sec. 11.81.420.   Justification: Performance of public duty.

(a) Unless inconsistent with AS 11.81.320§11.81.410, conduct which would otherwise constitute an offense is justified when it is required or authorized by law or by a judicial decree, judgment, or order.

(b) The justification afforded by this section also applies when

(1) the person reasonably believes the conduct to be required or authorized by a decree, judgment, or order of a court of competent jurisdiction or in the lawful execution of legal process, notwithstanding lack of jurisdiction of the court or defect in the legal process; or

(2) the person reasonably believes the conduct to be required or authorized to assist a peace officer in the performance of the officer's duties, notwithstanding that the officer exceeded the officer's authority.

###### Sec. 11.81.430.   Justification: Use of force, special relationships.

(a) The use of force on another person that would otherwise constitute an offense is justified under any of the following circumstances:

(1) When and to the extent reasonably necessary and appropriate to promote the welfare of the child or incompetent person, a parent, guardian, or other person entrusted with the care and supervision of a child under 18 years of age or an incompetent person may use reasonable and appropriate nondeadly force on that child or incompetent person.

(2) When and to the extent reasonably necessary and appropriate to maintain order and when the use of force is consistent with the welfare of the students, a teacher may, if authorized by school regulations and the principal of the school, use reasonable and appropriate nondeadly force on a student. If authorized by school regulations and the principal of the school, a teacher may use nondeadly force under this paragraph in any situation in which the teacher is responsible for the supervision of students. A teacher employed by a school board, including a regional educational attendance area school board, may use nondeadly force under this paragraph only if the school regulations authorizing the use of force have been adopted by the school board.

(3) When and to the extent reasonably necessary and appropriate to maintain order, a person responsible for the maintenance of order in a common carrier of passengers, or a person acting under that person's direction, may use reasonable and appropriate nondeadly force.

(4) When and to the extent reasonably necessary to prevent a suicide, a person who reasonably believes that another is imminently about to commit suicide may use reasonable and appropriate nondeadly force on that person.

(5) A licensed physician, licensed mobile intensive care paramedic, or registered or advanced practice registered nurse; or a person acting under the direction of a licensed physician, licensed mobile intensive care paramedic, or registered or advanced practice registered nurse; or any person who renders emergency care at the scene of an emergency, may use reasonable and appropriate nondeadly force for the purpose of administering a recognized and lawful form of treatment that is reasonably adapted to promoting the physical or mental health of the patient if

(A) the treatment is administered with the consent of the patient or, if the patient is a child under 18 years of age or an incompetent person, with the consent of the parent, guardian, or other person entrusted with care and supervision of the child or incompetent person; or

(B) the treatment is administered in an emergency if the person administering the treatment reasonably believes that no one competent to consent can be consulted under the circumstances and that a reasonable person, wishing to safeguard the welfare of the patient, would consent.

(b) A person who raises a defense under (a)(1) of this section and claims that the person upon whom force was used was an incompetent person has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that, at the time force was used, the person upon whom the force was used was an incompetent person.

###### Sec. 11.81.440.   Duress.

(a) In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defense that the defendant engaged in the proscribed conduct because the defendant was coerced to do so by the use of unlawful force upon the defendant or a third person, which force a reasonable person in the defendant's situation would have been unable to resist.

(b) The defense of duress is not available when one recklessly places oneself in a situation in which it is probable that one will be subject to duress.

###### Sec. 11.81.450.   Entrapment.

In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defense that, in order to obtain evidence of the commission of an offense, a public law enforcement official or a person working in cooperation with the official induced the defendant to commit the offense by persuasion or inducement as would be effective to persuade an average person, other than one who is ready and willing, to commit the offense.  Inducement or persuasion which would induce only a person engaged in an habitual course of unlawful conduct for gain or profit does not constitute entrapment.

#### Article 5. Prohibition on Prosecution.

###### Sec. 11.81.500.   No prosecution for safe surrender of infant.

A parent may not be criminally prosecuted for surrendering a child of the parent if the child

(1) is an infant who is less than 21 days of age;

(2) is surrendered in the manner described in AS 47.10.013(c); and

(3) is not the subject of a court order affecting custody of the child.

#### Article 6. General Principles of Criminal Liability.

###### Sec. 11.81.600.   General requirements of culpability.

(a) The minimal requirement for criminal liability is the performance by a person of conduct that includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act that the person is capable of performing.

(b) A person is not guilty of an offense unless the person acts with a culpable mental state, except that no culpable mental state must be proved

(1) if the description of the offense does not specify a culpable mental state and the offense is

(A) a violation; or

(B) designated as one of "strict liability"; or

(2) if a legislative intent to dispense with the culpable mental state requirement is present.

###### Sec. 11.81.610.   Construction of statutes with respect to culpability.

(a)  [Repealed,§44 ch 102 SLA 1980.]

(b) Except as provided in AS 11.81.600(b), if a provision of law defining an offense does not prescribe a culpable mental state, the culpable mental state that must be proved with respect to

(1) conduct is "knowingly"; and

(2) a circumstance or a result is "recklessly."

(c) When a provision of law provides that criminal negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, that element is also established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.  If acting recklessly suffices to establish an element, that element also is established if a person acts intentionally or knowingly.  If acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, that element is also established if a person acts intentionally.

###### Sec. 11.81.615.   Offenses defined by age or value.

Whenever a provision of law defining an offense requires a determination of the age of the victim or the value of property or services, it is not a defense to the lowest class of offense established by the evidence that the age of the victim is less than the age which would make the offense a higher class of offense or that the value of the property or services exceeds the value which would make the offense a higher class of offense, and a person may be charged and convicted accordingly.

###### Sec. 11.81.620.   Effect of ignorance or mistake upon liability.

(a) Knowledge, recklessness, or criminal negligence as to whether conduct constitutes an offense, or knowledge, recklessness, or criminal negligence as to the existence, meaning, or application of the provision of law defining an offense, is not an element of an offense unless the provision of law clearly so provides.  Use of the phrase "intent to commit a crime", "intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a crime", or like terminology in a provision of law does not require that the defendant act with a culpable mental state as to the criminality of the conduct that is the object of the defendant's intent.

(b) A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because the person engages in the conduct under a mistaken belief of fact, unless

(1) the factual mistake is a reasonable one that negates the culpable mental state required for the commission of the offense;

(2) the provision of law defining the offense or a related provision of law expressly provides that the factual mistake constitutes a defense or exemption; or

(3) the factual mistake is a reasonable one that supports a defense of justification as provided in AS 11.81.320§11.81.430.

###### Sec. 11.81.630.   Intoxication as a defense.

Voluntary intoxication is not a defense to a prosecution for an offense, but evidence that the defendant was intoxicated may be offered whenever it is relevant to negate an element of the offense that requires that the defendant intentionally cause a result.

###### Sec. 11.81.640.   Application of AS 11.81.600§11.81.630.

AS 11.81.600§11.81.630 apply only to this title.
