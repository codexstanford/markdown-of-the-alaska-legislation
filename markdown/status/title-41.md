(g) An organized borough, home rule city, first class city, second class city, regional educational attendance area, or a municipality organized under federal law that receives a national forest income payment or distribution under 16 U.S.C. 500 or this section shall annually report and account to the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development its use of the payment or distribution for the purposes provided in (a)§(e) of this section. The commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development may not distribute national forest income under this section to an entity in the unorganized borough that has previously failed to report and account as required under this subsection.

(h) For purposes of this section, if a portion of a home rule city, first class city, or second class city, or municipality organized under federal law in the unorganized borough is located within the national forest or within 20 miles of a national forest or if a regional educational attendance area has a school located within the national forest or within 20 miles of the national forest, the entire home rule city, first class city, or second class city, regional educational attendance area, or municipality organized under federal law is considered to be within the national forest.

(i) A payment or distribution made under this section shall be made under an appropriation for the purpose.

(j) That portion of the unorganized borough national forest receipts fund remaining in the account unobligated and unexpended on June 30 of a fiscal year shall be deposited into the unrestricted portion of the general fund and shall be used to offset expenses of the general fund for school and road maintenance in the affected areas of the unorganized borough for which direct distribution of funds has not been made.

(k) The department may adopt regulations necessary to implement this section that are consistent with federal law.

(l) If any provision of this section is determined by the department to be in conflict with federal requirements regarding the allocation of money received by the state from the federal government under (a) of this section, the provision that is in conflict is inoperative to the extent of the conflict. The determination does not affect the operation of any other provision of this section. Upon a determination that a provision of this section is in conflict with federal requirements regarding the allocation of money received from the federal government, the department may adopt regulations that modify the requirements of that provision to the extent necessary to comply with the federal requirements.

(m) To qualify to receive money under (d)(2) of this section, a municipality organized under federal law as an Indian reserve shall form a community development corporation with authority to determine how the money will be used. The charter must require that the governing board of the corporation shall be elected at an annual election open to all residents of the municipality organized under federal law who are registered and qualified to vote in state elections. The department may distribute money for the municipality organized under federal law only to a corporation organized in accordance with this subsection and only after the corporation has delivered a written waiver of sovereign immunity from legal action by the state to recover all or a portion of the money distributed under (d)(2) of this section.

(n) In this section, "number of children in average daily membership" means the number of full-time equivalent students enrolled in the city school district or regional educational attendance area, excluding correspondence students residing outside the school district's or regional educational attendance area's boundaries, that receives a share of the income from the public schools allocation of the fund created in (b) of this section.

(c) The commissioner shall give due deference to the Department of Environmental Conservation in decisions concerning water quality. The commissioner of environmental conservation retains the authority to adopt nonpoint source pollution regulations for activities subject to this chapter to the extent that regulations are not adopted by the commissioner of natural resources and approved by the commissioner of environmental conservation under this chapter. The commissioner of environmental conservation may withdraw approval of regulations adopted by the commissioner of natural resources under this chapter by following the procedure for the adoption, amendment, and repeal of regulations under AS 44.62.180§44.62.290.

(d) The commissioner shall recognize the expertise of the Department of Fish and Game with regard to fish and wildlife habitat. On private land, the commissioner shall give due deference to the Department of Fish and Game regarding effects on fish habitat from timber operations including variations to riparian standards, designation of alternative site-specific riparian protection plans, and road location decisions within riparian areas. On public land, the commissioner shall give due deference to the Department of Fish and Game regarding effects on fish and wildlife habitat from timber operations including timber harvest in riparian areas, variations to riparian standards, and road location decisions within riparian areas. In making decisions under AS 41.17.087, the commissioner shall recognize fish habitat as the primary value in riparian areas.

(e) In this section, "due deference" means that deference that is appropriate in the context of the agency's expertise and area of responsibility and all the evidence available to support a factual assertion. Where due deference is given, if the commissioner does not agree with a commenting agency, the commissioner shall prepare a written statement of the reasons for the disagreement.

(f) If a disagreement described in (e) of this section exists, an officer of an agency may require reevaluation of the disagreement at a higher level within the agencies, or by the governor if necessary, before a decision is made by the commissioner.

###### Sec. 41.17.100.   Deployment of broadcast chemicals.

The commissioner of environmental conservation, in consultation with the commissioner, shall formulate necessary plans and measures to ensure that application of broadcast chemicals and other substances foreign to the state's forest ecosystem do not lead to results contrary to the objectives and provisions of this chapter and other applicable laws and regulations relating to renewable resources. Regulations adopted by the commissioner of environmental conservation may include requirements for advance testing, posting of security, written reports, and other matters.

###### Sec. 41.17.110.   Conversion of forest land to other uses.

An intention to convert forest land to other uses after timber harvesting may be stated in the notification submitted under AS 41.17.090. In that event, reforestation requirements adopted under this chapter do not apply, except that conversion shall be completed during the time set by regulation for minimum reforestation of the land, and other requirements for revegetation may be imposed to the extent permitted by law. If the commissioner finds at any time that the responsible party has failed to conform to the intent to convert as stated in the notification, the commissioner shall revoke approval of the conversion and require full compliance with reforestation requirements.

A person who has assisted in the preparation of the division's case is ineligible. Hearings are not limited by common law, statutory, or judicial rules of evidence; however, the hearing officer may admit only that evidence that appears to be reliable and trustworthy.  All hearings shall be open to the public.  Written or oral testimony may be submitted.  A party to a hearing may make written or oral argument, secure the issuance of a subpoena under  AS 44.62.430, offer testimony or other evidence, and cross-examine witnesses.  The hearing officer shall endeavor, in conducting any hearing, to ensure that the respondent understands the proceedings and that the facts supporting the position of each party have been adequately presented.

(b) If the respondent notifies the commissioner within five days before the hearing provided for in (a) of this section, the following rules and procedures apply to the hearing:

(1) the hearing shall be a nonadversary proceeding, with the hearing officer fully and impartially representing the interests of the state and the respondent;

(2) the hearing officer shall thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances relating to the alleged violation, including taking testimony from appropriate persons, collecting and examining documents and other evidence, and performing other actions consistent with due process of law; and

(3) the hearing officer shall issue a decision in accordance with the applicable procedures of (a) of this section.

(c) The hearing officer shall select the location of the hearing, giving consideration to the convenience of the parties and witnesses.  The hearing officer may permit witnesses to testify through teleconferencing.

###### Sec. 41.17.141.   Enforcement of orders. [Repealed,§33 ch 34 SLA 1990.]

###### Sec. 41.17.143.   Appeals and judicial review.

(a) A decision by a hearing officer under AS 41.17.136 or 41.17.138 or by the commissioner under AS 41.17.082(b), 41.17.087, or 41.17.131(a) constitutes final agency action that may be appealed to the superior court within 30 days after it is issued.  Judicial review shall be as provided in AS 44.62.560 and 44.62.570.

(b) An operator, forest landowner, or timber owner may request the commissioner to reconsider the decision of a hearing officer within 30 days after it is issued.  Reconsideration is not a precondition of judicial review under (a) of this section.  If reconsideration is requested, the final agency action for purposes of judicial review is a decision by the commissioner to affirm, modify, or reverse the hearing officer or to deny the request for reconsideration.

(c) The commissioner may stay or modify a directive or order pending administrative or judicial review.  A stay or modification may not be appealed separately from an appeal of the substantive decision.

(d) A person, except the aggrieved forest landowner, timber owner, or operator, may not maintain an administrative or judicial appeal, or other action or proceeding of any kind, challenging a decision or failure to act by the department with respect to the compliance of a timber operation on private forest land with this chapter or a regulation, standard, directive, or order issued under this chapter. This subsection does not prohibit the maintenance of an action

(1) for an alleged violation of a constitutional right; or

(2) against the department regarding a regulation, standard, or systematic course of conduct that does not involve a challenge to, or attempt to enjoin, stay, modify, or otherwise affect a timber operation on private forest land subject to this chapter.

#### Article 4. State Forest System.

###### Sec. 41.17.200.   State forest purposes and management.

(a) The purpose of AS 41.17.200§41.17.230 is to permit the establishment of designated state-owned or acquired land and water areas as state forests. The primary purpose in the establishment of state forests is timber management that provides for the production, utilization, and replenishment of timber resources while allowing other beneficial uses of public land and resources.

(b) In managing a state forest, the commissioner shall, consistent with the primary purpose of a state forest under (a) of this section, restrict the public use of the land and its resources, including timber, fish and wildlife, and minerals, only when necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

###### Sec. 41.17.210.   State forests.

(a) The governor may propose to the legislature the establishment of state forests consisting primarily of commercially valuable forest land determined by the governor to be necessary for retention in state ownership for management under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield and consistent with AS 38.04.005. The proposal of the governor must include a report and recommendations of the commissioner including

(1) a preliminary forest inventory;

(2) a summary of the testimony offered at public hearings held on the management of the proposed state forest in communities proximately located to a proposed state forest;

(3)  [Repealed,§16 ch 153 SLA 2003.]

(4)  [Repealed,§16 ch 153 SLA 2003.]

(5) an estimate of the cost of a full implementation of an operational level forest inventory and the management plan.

(b) A state forest established by the legislature shall be retained in state ownership.

###### Sec. 41.17.220.   Management of state forests.

Land within a state forest or within a unit of a state forest shall be managed under

(1) the sustained yield principle;

(2) this chapter; and

(3) a forest management plan prepared by the department.

###### Sec. 41.17.230.   Management plans.

(a) The commissioner shall prepare a forest management plan consistent with AS 38.04.005 and this chapter for each state forest and for each unit of a state forest to assist in meeting the requirements of this chapter. An operational level forest inventory shall be completed before a forest management plan for the state forest or the unit of a state forest is adopted. The forest management plan shall be adopted, implemented, and maintained within three years of the establishment of a state forest by the legislature. To the extent they are found to be compatible with the primary purpose of state forests under AS 41.17.200, the forest management plan must consider and permit uses of forest land for nontimber purposes, including recreation, tourism, mining, mineral exploration, mineral leasing, material extraction, consumptive and nonconsumptive uses of wildlife and fish, grazing and other agricultural activities, and other traditional uses. If the commissioner finds that a permitted use is incompatible with one or more other uses in a portion of a state forest, the commissioner shall affirmatively state in the management plan that finding of incompatibility for the specific area where the incompatibility is anticipated to exist and the time period when the incompatibility is anticipated to exist together with the reasons and benefits for each finding.

(b) The commissioner shall review and revise a forest management plan when necessary.

(c) A management plan may not be adopted or revised after the establishment of the state forest without prior review by the Board of Forestry and by other appropriate state agencies or without prior public hearings held in a community proximately located to the state forest or to a unit of a state forest.

(d)  [Repealed,§16 ch 153 SLA 2003.]

#### Article 5. State Land Reforestation.

###### Sec. 41.17.300.   State land reforestation fund.

A state land reforestation fund is established in the department.  The money in the state land reforestation fund may be used only for the reforestation of state land, including site preparation, seed and seedling acquisition and cultivation, planting, and other reforestation measures, timber stand improvement, and the development of materials and techniques for the reforestation of state land.

###### Sec. 41.17.310.   Appropriations to state land reforestation fund.

(a) The state land reforestation fund consists of money appropriated by the legislature and contributions from private donors.  It is the intent of the legislature that the appropriations made to the fund equal no less than 25 percent of the revenues from the sale of timber and other forest products from state land as well as the total revenues from

(1) compensation for loss or damage to land within a state forest; and

(2) the federal government and other governmental units for reforestation.

(b) Money appropriated to or paid into the state land reforestation fund does not lapse.

###### Sec. 41.17.320.   Report.

The commissioner shall prepare an annual report on the uses of the money in the state land reforestation fund, the proposed uses of the fund in the following fiscal year, and the balance in the fund. The commissioner shall notify the legislature within the first 10 days of each session of the legislature that the report is available.

###### Sec. 41.21.122.   Management responsibility.

The state land and water described in AS 41.21.121 as the Chugach State Park is assigned to the department for control, development and maintenance, except that the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities is responsible for the repair and maintenance of all existing public roads within the park.  The control of highway access and roadside structures within the Chugach State Park is the responsibility of the department.  The Department of Fish and Game shall cooperate with the department to provide for those purposes under AS 41.21.121 relevant to the duties of the Department of Fish and Game.  If, in the exercise of management responsibility under this section, conflicts of land ownership, jurisdiction, or authority are unreconcilable or unmanageable other than at an unreasonable cost and expense to the state, the commissioner after public hearing in accordance with AS 44.62 may modify, subject to the approval of the legislature, the boundaries of the Chugach State Park not to exceed 20 percent of the total acreage described in AS 41.21.121.

###### Sec. 41.21.123.   Incompatible uses.

(a) The commissioner shall designate by regulation, adopted in accordance with AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act), incompatible uses within the boundaries of the Chugach State Park in accordance with AS 41.21.120§41.21.125, and those incompatible uses designated are prohibited or restricted as provided by regulation.

Under AS 38.05.300, state land, water, or land and water containing more than 640 acres may be closed to multiple purpose use only by act of the legislature.  Because the area described in AS 41.21.131 exceeds 640 acres, AS 41.21.130§41.21.142 are intended to provide for the closing of the described land and water to multiple purpose use in conformity with AS 38.05.300 and its subsequent designation as a special purpose site in accordance with art. VIII,§7, of the Constitution of the State of Alaska.

(5) provide an opportunity for the continued traditional and natural resource based lifestyle of the people living in the general areas described in AS 41.21.611(b), consistent with the other purposes of this subsection and (a) of this section.

(c) It is the intent of the legislature in enacting AS 41.21.610§41.21.630 to provide sufficient protection for the purposes for which the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve is established. Accordingly, the establishment of the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve and the Haines State Forest Resource Management Area under AS 41.15.305 is determined to represent a proper balance between the reservation of state public domain land and water for bald eagle preserve purposes and state public domain land and water more appropriate for multiple use. Therefore, the legislature determines that there is no need for legislation expanding or contracting the boundary of the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve in the future; the legislature further determines that study by a state agency of the expansion or contracting of the boundary of the preserve shall be conducted under AS 41.21.621.

(d) Inasmuch as the area described in AS 41.21.611(b) exceeds 640 acres, AS 41.21.610§41.21.630 are intended to close the area to multiple use in conformity with AS 38.05.300 and the land is dedicated as a special purpose site under art. VIII,§7 of the state constitution.

#### Article 1. Alaska Historic Preservation Act.

## Chapter 35. Historic Preservation.

###### Sec. 41.35.010.   Declaration of policy.

It is the policy of the state to preserve and protect the historic, prehistoric, and archeological resources of Alaska from loss, desecration, and destruction so that the scientific, historic, and cultural heritage embodied in these resources may pass undiminished to future generations.  To this end, the legislature finds and declares that the historic, prehistoric, and archeological resources of the state are properly the subject of concerted and coordinated efforts exercised on behalf of the general welfare of the public in order that these resources may be located, preserved, studied, exhibited, and evaluated.

###### Sec. 41.35.020.   Title to historic, prehistoric, and archeological resources; local display.

(a) The state reserves to itself title to all historic, prehistoric, and archeological resources situated on land owned or controlled by the state, including tideland and submerged land, and reserves to itself the exclusive right of field archeology on state-owned or controlled land. However, nothing in AS 41.35.010§41.35.240 diminishes the cultural rights and responsibilities of persons of aboriginal descent or infringes upon their right of possession and use of those resources that may be considered of historic, prehistoric, or archeological value.

(b) Although title to historic, prehistoric, and archeological resources is in the state, local cultural groups may obtain from the state, or retain, for study or display, artifacts and other items of these resources from their respective cultures or areas if the commission created in AS 41.35.300 finds that (1) the group has a durable building with weatherproof and fireproof construction and humidity control and other factors necessary to serve as a museum which will assure safe preservation of the items, (2) the item sought to be obtained is not one for which there is an undue risk of damage during transportation, and (3) the item sought to be obtained or retained is not one requiring special treatment or care beyond the ability or means of the group requesting it. A group retaining such an item or obtaining one from the state shall house it in the museum building and shall make every reasonable effort to assure its safe preservation. If the commission finds that a local cultural group is not properly taking care of an item the group shall return it to the department.

###### Sec. 41.35.030.   Designation of monuments and historic sites.

Upon the recommendation of the commission, the governor may declare by public order any particular historic, prehistoric, or archeological structure, deposit, site, or other object of scientific or historic interest that is situated on land owned or controlled by the state to be a state monument or historic site, and the governor may designate as a part of the monument or site as much land as is considered necessary for the proper access, care, and management of the object or site to be protected. When an object or site is situated on land held in private ownership, it may be declared a state monument or historic site in the same manner, with the written consent of the owner.

###### Sec. 41.35.040.   Administration and financial support of monuments and historic sites.

State-owned monuments, sites, and other historic, prehistoric, or archeological properties owned or purchased by the state are under the control of the department, and their maintenance shall be covered in the appropriations made to the department.  Privately owned state monuments or historic sites are eligible to receive state support for their maintenance, restoration, and rehabilitation if they are kept accessible to the general public and application for support is made in conformity with regulations adopted by the commissioner.

###### Sec. 41.35.045.   Fees for guided tours through historical sites. [Repealed,§3 ch 89 SLA 1987.]

The department shall preserve and administer property so acquired. The department may acquire property adjacent to the property having historic, prehistoric, or archeological significance when it is determined to be necessary for the proper use and administration of the significant property.

(b) If an historic, prehistoric, or archeological property which has been found by the department, upon the recommendation of the commission, to be important for state ownership is in danger of being sold or used so that its historic, prehistoric, or archeological value will be destroyed or seriously impaired, or is otherwise in danger of destruction or serious impairment, the department may establish the use of the property in a manner necessary to preserve its historic, prehistoric, or archeological character or value. If the owner of the property does not wish to follow the restrictions of the department, the department may acquire the property by eminent domain under AS 09.55.240§09.55.460.

###### Sec. 41.35.070.   Preservation of historic, prehistoric, and archeological resources threatened by public construction.

(a) The department shall locate, identify, and preserve in suitable records information regarding historic, prehistoric, and archeological sites, locations, and remains.  The information shall be submitted to the heads of the executive departments of the state.

(b) Before public construction or public improvement of any nature is undertaken by the state, or by a governmental agency of the state or by a private person under contract with or licensed by the state or governmental agency of the state, the department may survey the affected area to determine if the area contains historic, prehistoric, or archeological values.

(c) If the department determines that historic, prehistoric, or archeological sites, locations, or remains will be adversely affected by the public construction or improvement, the proposed public construction or improvement may not be commenced until the department has performed the necessary investigation, recording, and salvage of the site, location, or remains.  All investigation, recording, and salvage work shall be performed as expeditiously as possible so that no state construction project will be unduly impaired, impeded, or delayed.

(d) If in the course of performing public construction or improvements, historic, prehistoric, or archeological sites, locations, remains, or objects are discovered, the department shall be notified and its concurrence shall be requested in continuing the construction or improvement.  Upon receipt of this notice, the department shall survey the area to determine whether the area contains historic, prehistoric, or archeological data which should be preserved in the public interest.  The survey shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible.  If, as a result of the survey, it is determined that (1) this data exists in the area, (2) the data has exceptional historic, prehistoric, or archeological significance, and should be collected and preserved in the public interest, and (3) it is feasible to collect and preserve the data, the department shall perform the necessary work to collect and preserve the data.  This work shall be performed as expeditiously as possible.

(e) If the concurrence of the department required under (b) and (c) of this section is not obtained after 90 days from the filing of a request for its concurrence to proceed with the project, the agency or person performing the construction or improvement may apply to the governor for permission to proceed without that concurrence, and the governor may take the action the governor considers best in overruling or sustaining the department.

(f) The costs of investigation, recording, and salvage of the site shall be reimbursed by the agency sponsoring the construction project.

(g) Notwithstanding (a)§(f) of this section, all actions to stop any project shall first be approved in writing by the commissioner.

###### Sec. 41.35.080.   Permits.

The commissioner may issue a permit for the investigation, excavation, gathering, or removal from the natural state, of any historic, prehistoric, or archeological resources of the state.  A permit may be issued only to persons or organizations qualified to make the investigations, excavations, gatherings, or removals and only if the results of these authorized activities will be made available to the general public through institutions and museums interested in disseminating knowledge on the subjects involved.  If the historic, prehistoric, or archeological resource involved is one which is, or is located on a site which is, sacred, holy, or of religious significance to a cultural group, the consent of that cultural group must be obtained before a permit may be issued under this section.

###### Sec. 41.35.090.   Notice required of private persons.

Before any construction, alteration, or improvement of any nature is undertaken on a privately owned, officially designated state monument or historic site by any person, the person shall give the department three months notice of intention to construct on, alter, or improve it.  Before the expiration of the three-month notification period, the department shall either begin eminent domain proceedings under AS 41.35.060(b) or undertake or permit the recording and salvaging of any historic, prehistoric, or archeological information considered necessary.

###### Sec. 41.35.100.   Excavation and removal of historic, prehistoric, or archeological remains on private land.

Before any historic, prehistoric, or archeological remains are excavated or removed from private land by the department, the written approval of the owner shall first be secured.  When the value of the private land is diminished by the excavation or removal, the owner of the land shall be compensated for the loss at a monetary sum mutually agreed on by the department and the owner or at a monetary sum set by the court.

###### Sec. 41.98.110.   Western Interstate Nuclear Compact.

The Western Interstate Nuclear Compact, hereinafter called "the compact," is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other states legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows:

The party states recognize that the proper employment of scientific and technological discoveries and advances in nuclear and related fields and direct and collateral application and adaptation of processes and techniques developed in connection therewith, properly correlated with the other resources of the region, can assist substantially in the industrial progress of the West and the further development of the economy of the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from nuclear and related scientific or technological resources, facilities and skills require systematic encouragement, guidance, assistance, and promotion from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake this cooperation on a continuing basis. It is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort in nuclear and related fields, to enhance the economy of the West and contribute to the individual and community well-being of the region's people.

(a) There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the "Western Interstate Nuclear Board" (hereinafter called the board). The board shall be composed of one member from each party state designated or appointed in accordance with the law of the state which the member represents and serving and subject to removal in accordance with such law. A member of the board may provide for the discharge of the member's duties and the performance of the member's functions thereon (either for the duration of the term of the member or for any lesser period of time) by a deputy or assistant, if the laws of the member's state make specific provisions for this. The federal government may be represented without vote if provision is made by federal law for such representation.

(b) The board members of the party states are each entitled to one vote on the board.  No action of the board is binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of all members representing the party states are present and unless a majority of the total number of votes on the board are cast in favor of it.

(c) The board shall have a seal.

(d) The board shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice-chairman, and a treasurer. The board shall appoint and fix the compensation of an executive director who shall serve at its pleasure and who shall also act as secretary, and who, together with the treasurer, and such other personnel as the board may direct, shall be bonded in such amounts as the board may require.

(e) The executive director, with the approval of the board, shall appoint and remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the board's functions irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states.

(f) The board may establish and maintain, independently or in conjunction with any one or more of the party states, or its institutions or subdivisions, a suitable retirement system for its full-time employees. Employees of the board are eligible for social security coverage in respect of old age and survivors insurance if the board takes such steps as are necessary under federal law to participate in such a program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit. The board may establish and maintain or participate in such additional programs of employee benefits as may be appropriate.

(g) The board may borrow, accept, or contract for the services of personnel from any state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, from any interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation.

(h) The board may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services (conditional or otherwise) from any state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, or interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm, or corporation, and may receive, utilize, and dispose of them.

(j) The board shall adopt bylaws, rules, and regulations for the conduct of its business, and has the power to amend and rescind these bylaws, rules and regulations.  The board shall publish its bylaws, rules, and regulations in convenient form and shall file a copy of them, and shall also file a copy of any amendments to them, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.

(k) The board annually shall make to the governor of each party state, a report covering the activities of the board for the preceding year, and embodying such recommendations as may have been adopted by the board, which report shall be transmitted to the legislature of the state. The board may issue such additional reports as it considers desirable.

(a) The board shall submit to the governor or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that jurisdiction for presentation to its legislature.

(b) Each of the board's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. Each of the board's requests for appropriations under a budget of estimated expenditures shall be apportioned equally among the party states. Subject to appropriation by their respective legislatures, the board shall be provided with such funds by each of the party states as are necessary to provide the means of establishing and maintaining facilities, a staff of personnel, and such activities as may be necessary to fulfill the powers and duties imposed upon and entrusted to the board.

(c) The board may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under Article II (h) of this compact, if the board takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to the incurring of any obligations to be met in whole or in part in this manner. Except where the board makes use of funds available to it under Article II (h) of this compact, the board may not incur any obligation before the allotment of funds by the party jurisdictions adequate to meet the obligation.

No withdrawal affects any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state before the time of the withdrawal.

(d) Guam and American Samoa, or either of them, may participate in the compact to such extent as may be mutually agreed by the board and the duly constituted authorities of Guam or American Samoa, as the case may be. However, this participation may not include the furnishing or receipt of mutual aid under Article VI, unless that article has been enacted or otherwise adopted so as to have the full force and effect of law in the jurisdiction affected.
