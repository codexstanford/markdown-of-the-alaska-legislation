#### Article 1. Nature and Property of Partnership.

###### Sec. 32.06.201.   Partnership as entity.

(a) A partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.

(b) A limited liability partnership continues to be the same entity that existed before the filing of a statement of qualification under AS 32.06.911.

###### Sec. 32.06.202.   Formation of partnership.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in (b) of this section, the association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit forms a partnership, whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership.

(b) An association formed under a statute other than this chapter, a predecessor statute, or a comparable statute of another jurisdiction is not a partnership under this chapter.

(c) In determining whether a partnership is formed, the following rules apply:

(1) joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entirety, joint property, common property, or part ownership does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the co-owners share profits made by the use of the property;

(2) the sharing of gross returns does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in property from which the returns are derived;

(3) a person who receives a share of the profits of a business is presumed to be a partner in the business, unless the profits are received in payment

(A) of a debt by installments or otherwise;

(B) for services as an independent contractor, or of wages or other compensation to an employee;

(C) of rent;

(D) of an annuity or other retirement or health benefit provided to a beneficiary, representative, or designee of a deceased or retired partner;

(E) of interest or other charge on a loan, even if the amount of payment varies with the profits of the business, including a direct or indirect present or future ownership of the collateral, or rights to income, proceeds, or increase in value derived from the collateral; or

(F) for the sale of the good will of a business or other property by installments or otherwise.

###### Sec. 32.06.203.   Partnership property.

Property acquired by a partnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners individually.

###### Sec. 32.06.204.   When property is partnership property.

(a) Property is partnership property if acquired in the name of

(1) the partnership; or

(2) one or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person's capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership but without an indication of the name of the partnership.

(b) Property is acquired in the name of the partnership by a transfer to

(1) the partnership in its name; or

(2) one or more partners in their capacity as partners in the partnership if the name of the partnership is indicated in the instrument transferring title to the property.

(c) Property is presumed to be partnership property if purchased with partnership assets, even if not acquired in the name of the partnership or of one or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person's capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership.

(d) Property acquired in the name of one or more of the partners, without an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person's capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership and without use of partnership assets, is presumed to be separate property even if used for partnership purposes.

#### Article 2. Relations of Partners to Persons Dealing with Partnership.

###### Sec. 32.06.301.   Partner as agent of partnership.

Subject to the effect of a statement of partnership authority under AS 32.06.303,

(1) each partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business; an act of a partner, including the execution of an instrument in the partnership name, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership, unless the partner does not have authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter and the person with whom the partner is dealing knows or has received a notification that the partner lacks authority;

(2) an act of a partner that is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership does not bind the partnership unless the act was authorized by the other partners.

###### Sec. 32.06.302.   Transfer and recovery of partnership property.

(a) Subject to the effect of a statement of partnership authority under AS 32.06.303, partnership property held in the name of the partnership may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by a partner in the partnership name.

(b) Partnership property held in the name of one or more partners, with an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, but without an indication of the name of the partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held.

(c) Partnership property held in the name of one or more persons other than the partnership, without an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held.

(d) A partnership may recover partnership property from a transferee only if the partnership proves that execution of the instrument of initial transfer did not bind the partnership under AS 32.06.301 and

(1) as to a subsequent transferee who gave value for property transferred under (a) or (b) of this section, that the subsequent transferee knew or had received a notification that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership; or

(2) as to a transferee who gave value for property transferred under (c) of this section, that the transferee knew or had received a notification that the property was partnership property, and that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership.

(e) A partnership may not recover partnership property from a subsequent transferee if the partnership would not have been entitled to recover the property under (d) of this section from an earlier transferee of the property.

(f) If a person holds all of the partners' interests in the partnership, all of the partnership property vests in the person. The person may execute a document in the name of the partnership to evidence vesting of the property in the person and may file or record the document.

###### Sec. 32.06.303.   Statement of partnership authority.

(a) A partnership may file a statement of partnership authority that

(1) must include

(A) the name of the partnership;

(B) the street address of its chief executive office and an office in this state, if there is one;

(C) the names and mailing addresses of all of the partners or an agent appointed and maintained by the partnership for the purpose of (b) of this section; and

(D) the names of the partners authorized to execute an instrument transferring real property held in the name of the partnership; and

(2) may state

(A) the authority, or limitations on the authority, of some or all of the partners to enter into other transactions on behalf of the partnership; and

(B) any other matter.

(b) If a statement of partnership authority names an agent, the agent shall maintain a list of the names and mailing addresses of all of the partners and make it available to any person on request for good cause shown.

(c) If a filed statement of partnership authority is executed under AS 32.06.970(c) and states the name of the partnership but does not contain all of the other information required by (a) of this section, the statement nevertheless operates with respect to a person who is not a partner as provided in (d) and (e) of this section.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in (g) of this section, a filed statement of partnership authority supplements the authority of a partner to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership as follows:

(1) except for transfers of real property, a grant of authority contained in a filed statement of partnership authority is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a limitation on the grant of authority is not then contained in another filed statement; a filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority;

(2) a grant of authority to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership and contained in a certified copy of a filed statement of partnership authority recorded in the office for recording transfers of the real property is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a certified copy of a filed statement containing a limitation on the grant of authority is not then of record in the office for recording transfers of that real property; the recording, in the office for recording transfers of that real property, of a certified copy of a filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.

(e) A person who is not a partner is considered to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership if a certified copy of the filed statement containing the limitation on authority is of record in the office for recording transfers of that real property.

(f) Except as otherwise provided in (d) and (e) of this section and in AS 32.06.704 and 32.06.805, a person who is not a partner is not considered to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner merely because the limitation is contained in a filed statement.

(g) Unless earlier cancelled, a filed statement of partnership authority is cancelled by operation of law five years after the date on which the statement or the most recent amendment is filed with the department.

###### Sec. 32.06.304.   Statement of denial.

A partner or other person named as a partner in a filed statement of partnership authority or in a list maintained by an agent under AS 32.06.303(b) may file a statement of denial stating the name of the partnership and the fact that is being denied, which may include denial of a person's authority or status as a partner. A statement of denial is a limitation on authority under AS 32.06.303(d) and (e).

###### Sec. 32.06.305.   Partnership liable for partner's actionable conduct.

(a) A partnership is liable for loss or injury caused to a person, or for a penalty incurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a partner acting in the ordinary course of business of the partnership or with authority of the partnership.

(b) If, in the course of the partnership's business or while acting with authority of the partnership, a partner receives or causes the partnership to receive money or property of a person who is not a partner and the money or property is misapplied by a partner, the partnership is liable for the loss.

###### Sec. 32.06.306.   Partner's liability.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in (b) and (c) of this section, all partners are liable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided by law.

(b) A person admitted as a partner into an existing partnership is not personally liable for a partnership obligation incurred before the person's admission as a partner.

(c) An obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a limited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, in tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the partnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for the obligation solely by reason of being or acting as a partner. This subsection applies even if inconsistent with a partnership agreement provision that exists immediately before the vote required to become a limited liability partnership under AS 32.06.911(b).

###### Sec. 32.06.307.   Actions by and against partnership and partners.

(a) A partnership may sue and be sued in the name of the partnership.

(b) An action may be brought against a partnership and, to the extent not inconsistent with AS 32.06.306, any or all of the partners in the same action or in separate actions.

(c) A judgment against a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may not be satisfied from a partner's assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.

(d) A judgment creditor of a partner may not execute against the assets of the partner to satisfy a judgment based on a claim against the partnership unless the partner is personally liable for the claim under AS 32.06.306 and

(1) a judgment based on the same claim has been obtained against the partnership and a writ of execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part;

(2) the partnership is a debtor in bankruptcy;

(3) the partner has agreed that the creditor is not required to exhaust partnership assets;

(4) a court grants permission to the judgment creditor to execute against the assets of a partner based on a finding that partnership assets subject to execution are clearly insufficient to satisfy the judgment, that exhaustion of partnership assets is excessively burdensome, or that the grant of permission is an appropriate exercise of the court's equitable powers; or

(5) liability is imposed on the partner by law or contract independent of the existence of the partnership.

(e) This section applies to any partnership liability or obligation resulting from a representation by a partner or purported partner under AS 32.06.308.

###### Sec. 32.06.308.   Liability of purported partner.

(a) If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented by another as a partner, in a partnership or with one or more persons who are not partners, the purported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made if that person, relying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership. If the representation, either by the purported partner or by a person with the purported partner's consent, is made in a public manner, the purported partner is liable to a person who relies upon the purported partnership even if the purported partner is not aware of being held out as a partner to the claimant. If partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to the liability as if the purported partner were a partner. If partnership liability does not result, the purported partner is liable with respect to the liability jointly and severally with any other person consenting to the representation.

(b) If, under (a) of this section, a person is represented to be a partner in an existing partnership, or with one or more persons who are not partners, the purported partner is an agent of the persons consenting to the representation to bind those persons to the same extent and in the same manner as if the purported partner were a partner with respect to persons who enter into transactions in reliance upon the representation. If all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership act or obligation results. If fewer than all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, the person acting and the partners consenting to the representation are jointly and severally liable.

(c) A person is not liable as a partner merely because the person is named by another in a statement of partnership authority.

(d) A person does not continue to be liable as a partner merely because of a failure to file a statement of dissociation or to amend a statement of partnership authority to indicate the partner's dissociation from the partnership.

(e) Except as otherwise provided in (a) and (b) of this section, persons who are not partners as to each other are not liable as partners to other persons.

#### Article 3. Relations of Partners to Each Other and to Partnership.

###### Sec. 32.06.401.   Partner's rights and duties.

(a) Each partner is considered to have an account that is

(1) credited with an amount equal to

(A) the money and the value of any other property, net of the amount of any liabilities, the partner contributes to the partnership; and

(B) the partner's share of the partnership profits; and

(2) charged with an amount equal to

(A) the money and the value of any other property, net of the amount of any liabilities, distributed by the partnership to the partner; and

(B) the partner's share of the partnership losses.

(b) Each partner is entitled to an equal share of the partnership profits and is chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the partner's share of the profits.

(c) A partnership shall reimburse a partner for payments made and indemnify a partner for liabilities incurred by the partner in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or for the preservation of the partnership's business or property.

(d) A partnership shall reimburse a partner for an advance to the partnership beyond the amount of capital the partner agreed to contribute.

(e) A payment or advance made by a partner that results in a partnership obligation under (c) or (d) of this section constitutes a loan to the partnership that accrues interest from the date of the payment or advance.

(f) Each partner has equal rights in the management and conduct of the partnership business.

(g) A partner may use or possess partnership property only on behalf of the partnership.

(h) A partner is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for the partnership, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the business of the partnership.

(j) A difference arising as to a matter in the ordinary course of business of a partnership may be decided by a majority of the partners. An act outside the ordinary course of business of a partnership and an amendment to the partnership agreement may be undertaken only with the consent of all the partners.

(k) This section does not affect the obligations of a partnership to other persons under AS 32.06.301.

(b) A partnership shall provide partners and their agents and attorneys access to its records. It shall provide former partners and their agents and attorneys access to records pertaining to the period during which they were partners. The right of access provides the opportunity to inspect and copy records during ordinary business hours. A partnership may impose a reasonable charge covering the costs of labor and material for copies of documents furnished.

(c) Each partner and the partnership shall furnish to a partner, and to the legal representative of a deceased partner or partner under legal disability

(1) without demand, any information concerning the partnership's business and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner's rights and duties under the partnership agreement or this chapter; and

(2) on demand, any other information concerning the partnership's business and affairs, except to the extent the demand or the information demanded is unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances.

###### Sec. 32.06.404.   General standards of partner's conduct.

(2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership; and

(3) to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business before the dissolution of the partnership.

(c) A partner's duty of care to the partnership and the other partners in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law.

(f) A partner may lend money to and transact other business with the partnership, and the rights and obligations of the partner are the same with regard to the loan or transaction as the rights and obligations of a person who is not a partner, subject to other applicable law.

(c) The accrual of, and any time limitation on, a right of action for a remedy under this section are governed by other law. A right to an accounting upon a dissolution and winding up does not revive a claim barred by law.

###### Sec. 32.06.406.   Continuation of partnership beyond definite term or particular undertaking.

(a) If a partnership for a definite term or particular undertaking is continued, without an express agreement, after the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were at the expiration or completion to the extent consistent with a partnership at will.

The interest of a partner, whether or not transferable, is personal property.

###### Sec. 32.06.503.   Transfer of partner's transferable interest.

(a) A transfer, in whole or in part, of a partner's transferable interest in the partnership

(1) is permissible;

(2) does not by itself cause the partner's dissociation or a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business; and

(3) does not, as against the other partners or the partnership, entitle the transferee during the continuance of the partnership to participate in the management or conduct of the partnership business, to require access to information concerning partnership transactions, or to inspect or copy the partnership records.

(b) A transferee of a partner's transferable interest in the partnership has a right to

(1) receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled;

(2) receive upon the dissolution and winding up of the partnership business, in accordance with the transfer, the net amount otherwise distributable to the transferor; and

(3) seek under AS 32.06.801(6) a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the partnership business.

(c) In a dissolution and winding up, a transferee is entitled to an account of partnership transactions only from the date of the latest account agreed to by all of the partners.

(d) Upon transfer, the transferor retains the rights and duties of a partner other than the interest in distributions transferred.

(e) A partnership is not required to give effect to a transferee's rights under this section until it has notice of the transfer.

(f) A transfer of a partner's transferable interest in the partnership in violation of a restriction on transfer contained in the partnership agreement is ineffective as to a person having notice of the restriction at the time of transfer.

(a) On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or of a partner's transferee, a court having jurisdiction may charge the transferable interest of the judgment debtor to satisfy the judgment. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment debtor in respect of the partnership and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or that the circumstances of the case may require.

(b) A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's transferable interest in the partnership. The court may order a foreclosure of the interest subject to the charging order at any time. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee.

(c) At any time before foreclosure, an interest charged may be redeemed

(1) by the judgment debtor;

(2) with property other than partnership property by one or more of the other partners; or

(3) with partnership property by one or more of the other partners with the consent of all of the partners whose interests are not charged.

(d) This chapter does not deprive a partner of a right under exemption laws with respect to the partner's interest in the partnership.

(e) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a partner or partner's transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's transferable interest in the partnership.

(8) in the case of a partner that is a trust or is acting as a partner by virtue of being a trustee of a trust, distribution of the trust's entire transferable interest in the partnership, but the substitution of a successor trustee does not by itself qualify as a distribution under this paragraph;

(9) in the case of a partner that is an estate or is acting as a partner by virtue of being a personal representative of an estate, distribution of the estate's entire transferable interest in the partnership, but the substitution of a successor personal representative does not by itself qualify as a distribution under this paragraph; or

###### Sec. 32.06.602.   Partner's power to dissociate; wrongful dissociation.

#### Article 6. Partner's Dissociation when Business not Wound Up.

###### Sec. 32.06.701.   Purchase of dissociated partner's interest.

(a) If a partner is dissociated from a partnership without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business under AS 32.06.801, the partnership shall cause the dissociated partner's interest in the partnership to be purchased for a buy-out price determined under (b) of this section.

(b) The buy-out price of a dissociated partner's interest is the amount that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner under AS 32.06.807(b) if, on the date of dissociation, the assets of the partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern without the dissociated partner and if the partnership were wound up as of that date.

A partnership is dissolved, and its business must be wound up, only on the occurrence of any of the following events:

(C) the expiration of the term or the completion of the undertaking;

(3) an event agreed to in the partnership agreement resulting in the winding up of the partnership business;

(5) on application by a partner, a judicial determination that

(A) the economic purpose of the partnership is likely to be unreasonably frustrated;

In that event,

(1) the partnership resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred, and any liability incurred by the partnership or a partner after the dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if dissolution had never occurred; and

###### Sec. 32.11.320.   Nature of partnership interest.

The interest of a partner, whether or not transferable, is personal property.

###### Sec. 32.11.330.   Assignment of partnership interest.

Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partnership interest is assignable in whole or in part. An assignment of a partnership interest does not dissolve a limited partnership or entitle the assignee to become or to exercise the rights of a partner. An assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distribution to which the assignor would be entitled. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partner ceases to be a partner upon assignment of all of the partner's partnership interest.

###### Sec. 32.11.340.   Rights of creditor.

(a) On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by a judgment creditor of a partner, the court may charge the partnership interest of the partner with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of the partnership interest. This chapter does not deprive a partner of the benefit of an exemption law applicable to the partner's partnership interest.

(b) This section provides the exclusive remedy that a judgment creditor of a general or limited partner or of the general or limited partner's assignee may use to satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's interest in the partnership. Other legal or equitable remedies, including foreclosure on the general or limited partner's partnership interest and a court order for directions, accounts, and inquiries that the debtor general or limited partner might have made, are not available to the judgment creditor attempting to satisfy the judgment out of the judgment debtor's interest in the limited partnership and may not be ordered by a court.

###### Sec. 32.11.350.   Right of assignee to become limited partner.

(a) An assignee of a partnership interest, including an assignee of a general partner, may become a limited partner if and to the extent that

(1) the assignor gives the assignee that right in accordance with authority described in the partnership agreement; or

(2) all other partners consent.

(b) An assignee who has become a limited partner has, to the extent assigned, the rights and powers, and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of a limited partner under the partnership agreement and this chapter. An assignee who becomes a limited partner also is liable for the obligations of the assignee's assignor to make and return contributions as provided in AS 32.11.200§32.11.310. However, the assignee is not obligated for liabilities unknown to the assignee at the time the assignee became a limited partner.

(c) If an assignee of a partnership interest becomes a limited partner, the assignor is not released from the assignor's liability to the limited partnership under AS 32.11.070 and 32.11.210.

###### Sec. 32.11.360.   Power of estate of deceased or incompetent partner.

If a partner who is an individual dies or a court of competent jurisdiction adjudges the partner to be incompetent to manage the partner's person or the partner's property, the partner's executor, administrator, guardian, conservator, or other legal representative may exercise all of the partner's rights for the purpose of settling the partner's estate or administering the partner's property, including any power the partner had to give an assignee the right to become a limited partner. If a partner is a corporation, trust, or other entity and is dissolved or terminated, the powers of that partner may be exercised by its legal representative or successor.

#### Article 7. Dissolution.

###### Sec. 32.11.370.   Dissolution.

(4) entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under AS 32.11.380.

###### Sec. 32.11.380.   Judicial dissolution.

On application by or for a partner, the superior court may decree dissolution of a limited partnership whenever it is impossible to carry on the business in conformity with the partnership agreement.

###### Sec. 32.11.390.   Winding up.

Except as provided in the partnership agreement, the general partners who have not wrongfully dissolved a limited partnership or, if there are no general partners, the limited partners, may wind up the limited partnership's affairs; but the superior court may wind up the limited partnership's affairs upon application of a partner, a partner's legal representative, or an assignee.

###### Sec. 32.11.400.   Distribution of assets.

Upon the winding up of a limited partnership, the assets shall be distributed as follows:

(1) to creditors, including partners who are creditors, to the extent permitted by law, in satisfaction of liabilities of the limited partnership other than liabilities for distributions to partners under AS 32.11.240 or 32.11.270;

(2) except as provided in the partnership agreement, to partners and former partners in satisfaction of liabilities for distributions under AS 32.11.240 or 32.11.270; and
