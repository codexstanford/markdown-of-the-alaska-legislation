(a) The operation of a motor vehicle by a nonresident, or owned by a nonresident and operated by the express or implied consent of the owner, in the state is considered equivalent to an appointment of the commissioner of administration by the nonresident as the nonresident's attorney. The summons may be served on the commissioner in an action against the nonresident growing out of an accident or collision in which the vehicle is involved while being so operated. This operation is considered a signification of the nonresident's agreement that a summons against the nonresident which is so served has the same legal force as if served on the nonresident personally in the state.

(b) Service of the summons is made by leaving a copy of it with the commissioner of administration or the designee of the commissioner. The commissioner or a designee shall keep a record of each such process and the day and hour of service. This service is sufficient service on the nonresident.

(c) The plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney shall send a notice of the service and a copy of the summons to the defendant by registered mail within 10 days after the date of service.

(d) The plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney shall make an affidavit showing that service of the notice and summons on the defendant has been made by registered mail as provided in (c) of this section.

###### Sec. 09.05.030.   Service on personal representative of deceased nonresident; substitution of personal representative.

(a) The death of a nonresident does not revoke the appointment of the commissioner of administration by the nonresident as attorney under AS 09.05.020. If the nonresident dies, an action growing out of the accident or collision may be begun or prosecuted against an executor or administrator duly appointed by the state, territory, or district of the United States or foreign country where the nonresident is domiciled at the time of death. Service of the summons shall be made on the commissioner of administration. Notice of the service and the copy of the process shall be given to the nonresident's executor or administrator in like manner, with the same force as service on a living nonresident.

(b) An action or proceeding pending in a state court, in which the court has obtained jurisdiction of a nonresident under AS 09.05.020, does not abate by reason of the nonresident's death.  The nonresident's executor or administrator duly appointed in the state, territory, or district of the United States or foreign country where the nonresident is domiciled at the time of death, shall, on the application of the plaintiff, be brought in and substituted in the place of the nonresident, and the action or proceeding shall continue.

###### Sec. 09.05.040.   Service of process on resident who leaves state after accident.

A resident who has operated a motor vehicle, or has owned a motor vehicle operated with the express or implied consent of the owner that has been involved in an accident or collision on a public highway, and who has moved to another state after the accident or collision shall be treated as a nonresident for service of process as provided under AS 09.05.020 and 09.05.030.

###### Sec. 09.05.050.   Service of process on state prisoners.

(a) In a civil action to which a person committed to the custody of the commissioner of corrections is a party or witness, service of process shall be made by delivering a copy of the summons and the complaint or pleadings, together with a form for affidavit of proof of service, to the shift supervisor of the correctional facility in which the person is housed.  The shift supervisor shall

(1) immediately hand deliver the summons and complaint or pleadings to the person whose name appears on the summons; and

(2) promptly complete the affidavit of proof of service on the form provided and return it to the party requesting service of process.

(b) A party requesting service of process under this section may locate a person committed to the custody of the commissioner of corrections by contacting the chief classification officer of the Department of Corrections during that officer's regular hours of work.

###### Sec. 09.17.020.   Punitive damages.

(a) In an action in which a claim of punitive damages is presented to the fact finder, the fact finder shall determine, concurrently with all other issues presented, whether punitive damages shall be allowed by using the standards set out in (b) of this section. If punitive damages are allowed, a separate proceeding under (c) of this section shall be conducted before the same fact finder to determine the amount of punitive damages to be awarded.

(b) The fact finder may make an award of punitive damages only if the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant's conduct

(1) was outrageous, including acts done with malice or bad motives; or

(2) evidenced reckless indifference to the interest of another person.

(c) At the separate proceeding to determine the amount of punitive damages to be awarded, the fact finder may consider

(1) the likelihood at the time of the conduct that serious harm would arise from the defendant's conduct;

(2) the degree of the defendant's awareness of the likelihood described in (1) of this subsection;

(d) At the conclusion of the separate proceeding under (c) of this section, the fact finder shall determine the amount of punitive damages to be awarded, and the court shall enter judgment for that amount.

(e) Unless that evidence is relevant to another issue in the case, discovery of evidence that is relevant to the amount of punitive damages to be determined under (c)(3) or (6) of this section may not be conducted until after the fact finder has determined that an award of punitive damages is allowed under (a) and (b) of this section. The court may issue orders as necessary, including directing the parties to have the information relevant to the amount of punitive damages to be determined under (c)(3) or (6) of this section available for production immediately at the close of the initial trial in order to minimize the delay between the initial trial and the separate proceeding to determine the amount of punitive damages.

(f) Except as provided in (g) and (h) of this section, an award of punitive damages may not exceed the greater of

(1) three times the amount of compensatory damages awarded to the plaintiff in the action; or

(2) the sum of $500,000.

(g) Except as provided in (h) of this section, if the fact finder determines that the conduct proven under (b) of this section was motivated by financial gain and the adverse consequences of the conduct were actually known by the defendant or the person responsible for making policy decisions on behalf of the defendant, it may award an amount of punitive damages not to exceed the greatest of

(1) four times the amount of compensatory damages awarded to the plaintiff in the action;

(2) four times the aggregate amount of financial gain that the defendant received as a result of the defendant's misconduct; or

(3) the sum of $7,000,000.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in an action against an employer to recover damages for an unlawful employment practice prohibited by AS 18.80.220, the amount of punitive damages awarded by the court or jury may not exceed

(1) $200,000 if the employer has less than 100 employees in this state;

(2) $300,000 if the employer has 100 or more but less than 200 employees in this state;

(3) $400,000 if the employer has 200 or more but less than 500 employees in this state; and

(4) $500,000 if the employer has 500 or more employees in this state.

(i) Subsection (h) of this section may not be construed to allow an award of punitive damages against the state or a person immune under another provision of law. In (h) of this section, "employees" means persons employed in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.

(j) If a person receives an award of punitive damages, the court shall require that 50 percent of the award be deposited into the general fund of the state. This subsection does not grant the state the right to file or join a civil action to recover punitive damages.

(k) In a civil action in which an employer is determined to be vicariously liable for the act or omission of an employee, punitive damages may not be awarded against the employer under principles of vicarious liability unless (1) the employer or the employer's managerial agent (A) authorized the act or omission and the manner in which the act was performed or omission occurred; or (B) ratified or approved the act or omission after the act or omission occurred; or (2) the employee (A) was unfit to perform the act or avoid the omission and the employer or the employer's managerial agent acted recklessly in employing or retaining the employee; or (B) was employed in a managerial capacity and was acting within the scope of employment. In this subsection, "managerial agent" means a management level employee with the stature and authority to exercise control, discretion, and independent judgment over a certain area of the employer's business and with some power to set policy for the employer.

###### Sec. 09.17.030.   [Renumbered as AS 09.65.210.]

###### Sec. 09.17.040.   Award of damages; periodic payments.

(a) In every case where damages for personal injury are awarded by the court or jury, the verdict shall be itemized between economic loss and noneconomic loss, if any, as follows:

(1) past economic loss;

(2) past noneconomic loss;

(3) future economic loss;

(4) future noneconomic loss; and

(5) punitive damages.

(b) The fact finder shall reduce future economic damages to present value.  In computing the portion of a lump-sum award that is attributable to future economic loss, the fact finder shall determine the present amount that, if invested at long-term future interest rates in the best and safest investments, will produce over the life expectancy of the injured party the amount necessary to compensate the injured party for

(1) the amount of wages the injured party could have been expected to earn during future years, taking into account future anticipated inflation and reasonably anticipated increases in the injured party's earnings; and

(2) the amount of money necessary during future years to provide for all additional economic losses related to the injury, taking into account future anticipated inflation.

(c) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to future economic damages if the parties agree that the award of future damages may be computed under the rule adopted in the case of Beaulieu v. Elliott, 434 P.2d 665 (Alaska 1967).

(d) In an action to recover damages, the court shall, at the request of an injured party, enter judgment ordering that amounts awarded a judgment creditor for future damages be paid to the maximum extent feasible by periodic payments rather than by a lump-sum payment.

(e) The court may require security be posted, in order to ensure that funds are available as periodic payments become due.  The court may not require security to be posted if an authorized insurer, as defined in AS 21.97.900, acknowledges to the court its obligation to discharge the judgment.

(f) A judgment ordering payment of future damages by periodic payment shall specify the recipient, the dollar amount of the payments, the interval between payments, and the number of payments or the period of time over which payments shall be made.  Payments may be modified only in the event of the death of the judgment creditor, in which case payments may not be reduced or terminated, but shall be paid to persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support, as provided by law, immediately before death.  In the event the judgment creditor owed no duty of support to dependents at the time of the judgment creditor's death, the money remaining shall be distributed in accordance with a will of the deceased judgment creditor accepted into probate or under the intestate laws of the state if the deceased had no will.

(g) If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a continuing pattern of failing to make payments required under (d) of this section, the court shall, in addition to the required periodic payments, order the judgment debtor to pay the judgment creditor any damages caused by the failure to make periodic payments, including costs and attorney fees.

###### Sec. 09.17.050.   [Renumbered as AS 09.65.170.]

###### Sec. 09.17.060.   Effect of contributory fault.

In an action based on fault seeking to recover damages for injury or death to a person or harm to property, contributory fault chargeable to the claimant diminishes proportionately the amount awarded as compensatory damages for the injury attributable to the claimant's contributory fault, but does not bar recovery.

###### Sec. 09.17.070.   Collateral benefits.

(a) After the fact finder has rendered an award to a claimant, and after the court has awarded costs and attorney fees, a defendant may introduce evidence of amounts received or to be received by the claimant as compensation for the same injury from collateral sources that do not have a right of subrogation by law or contract.

(b) If the defendant elects to introduce evidence under (a) of this section, the claimant may introduce evidence of

(1) the amount that the actual attorney fees incurred by the claimant in obtaining the award exceed the amount of attorney fees awarded to the claimant by the court; and

(2) the amount that the claimant has paid or contributed to secure the right to an insurance benefit introduced by the defendant as evidence.

(c) If the total amount of collateral benefits introduced as evidence under (a) of this section exceeds the total amount that the claimant introduced as evidence under (b) of this section, the court shall deduct from the total award the amount by which the value of the nonsubrogated sum awarded under (a) of this section exceeds the amount of payments under (b) of this section.

(d) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, the defendant may not introduce evidence of

(1) benefits that under federal law cannot be reduced or offset;

(2) a deceased's life insurance policy; or

(3) gratuitous benefits provided to the claimant.

(e) This section does not apply to a medical malpractice action filed under  AS 09.55.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the teachers' retirement system (AS 14.25) or the public employees' retirement system (AS 39.35) obtains an award of damages or other recovery in compensation for harms caused by the wrongful or negligent conduct of a third party, the award of damages or other recovery is not subject to reduction under this section on account of additional state contributions under  AS 14.25.085 or  AS 39.35.280.

###### Sec. 09.17.080.   Apportionment of damages.

(a) In all actions involving fault of more than one person, including third-party defendants and persons who have settled or otherwise been released, the court, unless otherwise agreed by all parties, shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories or, if there is no jury, shall make findings, indicating

(1) the amount of damages each claimant would be entitled to recover if contributory fault is disregarded; and

(2) the percentage of the total fault that is allocated to each claimant, defendant, third-party defendant, person who has been released from liability, or other person responsible for the damages unless the person was identified as a potentially responsible person, the person is not a person protected from a civil action under AS 09.10.055, and the parties had a sufficient opportunity to join that person in the action but chose not to; in this paragraph, "sufficient opportunity to join" means the person is

(A) within the jurisdiction of the court;

(B) not precluded from being joined by law or court rule; and

(C) reasonably locatable.

(b) In determining the percentages of fault, the trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the conduct of each person at fault, and the extent of the causal relation between the conduct and the damages claimed.

(c) The court shall determine the award of damages to each claimant in accordance with the findings and enter judgment against each party liable. The court also shall determine and state in the judgment each party's equitable share of the obligation to each claimant in accordance with the respective percentages of fault as determined under (a) of this section. Except as provided under AS 23.30.015(g), an assessment of a percentage of fault against a person who is not a party may only be used as a measure for accurately determining the percentages of fault of a named party. Assessment of a percentage of fault against a person who is not a party does not subject that person to civil liability in that action and may not be used as evidence of civil liability in another action.

(d) The court shall enter judgment against each party liable on the basis of several liability in accordance with that party's percentage of fault.

###### Sec. 09.17.090.   Effect of release. [Repealed,§17 ch 14 SLA 1987.]

###### Sec. 09.17.100.   [Renumbered as AS 09.65.180.]

###### Sec. 09.17.900.   Definition.

In this chapter, "fault" includes acts or omissions that are in any measure negligent, reckless, or intentional toward the person or property of the actor or others, or that subject a person to strict tort liability. The term also includes breach of warranty, unreasonable assumption of risk not constituting an enforceable express consent, misuse of a product for which the defendant otherwise would be liable, and unreasonable failure to avoid an injury or to mitigate damages. Legal requirements of causal relation apply both to fault as the basis for liability and to contributory fault.

## Chapter 19. Prisoner and Correctional Facility Litigation Against the State.

###### Sec. 09.19.010.   Limitation on exemption from filing fees.

(a) A prisoner may not commence litigation against the state unless the prisoner has paid full filing fees to the court or is a claimant under AS 23.20, except that the court may exempt a prisoner from paying part of those fees if the court finds exceptional circumstances as described in this section.

(b) To apply for a filing fee exemption, a prisoner shall submit to the court

(1) an affidavit that clearly discloses that the person is a prisoner and that sets out

(A) the prisoner's complete financial situation, including the prisoner's income, money in financial accounts, assets, and court-ordered payments;

(B) the circumstances that prevent the prisoner from paying full filing fees; and

(C) the nature of the action or appeal and specific facts that would, if proven, state a claim on which relief can be granted or entitle the prisoner to reversal on appeal;

(2) a certified copy of the prisoner's account statement from the correctional facility in which the prisoner is being or has been held for the six-month period preceding the submission of the application; and

(3) other documentation or financial information as the court may require.

(c) Based on the submission under (b) of this section, the court may grant an exemption from part of the applicable filing fees if the court finds that exceptional circumstances prevent the prisoner from paying full filing fees. Imprisonment and indigency do not constitute exceptional circumstances if the prisoner has available income or resources that can be applied to the filing fee.

(d) If the court orders an exemption under (c) of this section, the court shall determine the amount of the exemption and set a filing fee to be paid by the prisoner. In setting the fee, the court, at a minimum, shall require the prisoner to pay filing fees equal to 20 percent of the larger of the average monthly deposits made to the prisoner's account described in (b)(2) of this section, or the average balance in that account, not to exceed the amount of the full filing fee required under applicable court rules.

(e) The court shall mail or otherwise serve its order under (d) of this section on the prisoner. Along with its order, the court shall give written notice that the case or appeal will not be accepted for filing if payment of a filing fee is not made within 30 days after the date of distribution of the order, unless the time for payment is extended by the court. If timely payment is not made, the court may not accept any filing in the case or appeal. If payment is made, the prisoner's filing and supporting documents shall be accepted for filing with the court.

###### Sec. 09.19.020.   Dismissal for material misstatements.

If a prisoner has filed litigation against the state, the court shall dismiss that litigation if the court finds that the pleadings filed by the prisoner or an application filed by the prisoner to obtain an exemption under AS 09.19.010 contain a material statement made by the prisoner that is not true.

###### Sec. 09.19.030.   Stay in prisoner disciplinary appeals.

A superior court that reviews a disciplinary decision of the Department of Corrections as an administrative appeal may not enter an order staying disciplinary sanctions unless the pleadings filed by the prisoner establish by clear and convincing evidence that the prisoner has alleged a violation of a fundamental constitutional right and is likely to succeed on the merits in the appeal, that the prisoner faces irreparable harm if a stay is not granted, that the Department of Corrections can be adequately protected if a stay is granted, and that a stay will not adversely affect the public interest in effective penal administration.

###### Sec. 09.19.040.   Injunctions or orders imposing obligations in prisoner cases.

In litigation against the state brought by a prisoner, a court may not enter an injunction or issue an order or decision that would impose an obligation on the state or its employees that would exceed the obligations imposed by the United States Constitution, the Constitution of the State of Alaska, and applicable federal and state statutes and regulations, unless the obligation is agreed to by the state.

###### Sec. 09.19.050.   Discovery in prisoner cases.

The automatic disclosure provisions of Rule 26, Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure, do not apply to litigation against the state brought by a prisoner.

###### Sec. 09.19.100.   Definitions.

In this chapter,

(1) "litigation against the state" means a civil action or an appeal from a civil action or from the final decision of an administrative agency, a petition for review, a petition for hearing, an original application for relief, or another action filed under the Alaska Rules of Appellate Procedure that

(A) involves the state, an officer or agent of the state, or a state employee, or a former officer or agent of the state or state employee, regarding conduct that occurred during that former officer's, agent's, or employee's state employment or agency, whether the officer, agent, or employee is sued in an official or a personal capacity; and

(B) is related to a person's status or treatment as a prisoner, to a criminal charge against or involving the person, or to an alleged violation of the person's constitutional rights;

(2) "prisoner" has the meaning given in AS 33.30.901.

###### Sec. 09.19.200.   Correctional facility litigation.

(a) Except as provided in (b) and (e) of this section, a court may not order prospective relief in a civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions unless the court finds that (1) the plaintiff has proven a violation of a state or federal right, (2) the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and extends no further than is necessary to correct the violation of the right, (3) the prospective relief is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the right, and (4) the prisoner exhausted all administrative remedies available to the prisoner before filing the civil action. When a court finds multiple violations of a state or federal right, when multiple remedies are ordered by the prospective relief, or when prospective relief applies to multiple correctional facilities, the findings required by this subsection shall be made as to each violation, each remedy, and each facility, as appropriate. In a civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions that has been certified as a class action, prospective relief applicable to the class may only be ordered after the court makes the findings required by this subsection and finds that the violation of a state or federal right is applicable to the entire class. In making the findings required under this subsection, the court shall give substantial weight to any adverse effect on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the prospective relief.

(b) In a civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions, to the extent otherwise authorized by law, the court may enter a temporary restraining order or an order for preliminary injunctive relief only if the court finds that the relief is (1) narrowly drawn and extends no further than is necessary to correct the harm that requires preliminary relief, and (2) the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm. In making the findings required under this subsection, the court shall give substantial weight to any adverse effect on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the preliminary relief. Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire 90 days after the entry of the order unless the court orders final relief in the civil action before the expiration of the 90-day period.

(c) Prospective relief ordered in a civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions, including prospective relief ordered under a consent decree, regardless of whether that civil action was filed or the relief ordered before or after August 30, 1999, shall be terminated upon the motion of the defendant unless the court finds that there exists a current violation of a state or federal right and makes the findings required by (a) of this section as to each current violation and as to each remedy and facility, as appropriate. A civil action that has been certified as a class action shall be terminated upon the motion of the defendant unless the court makes the findings required by this subsection and finds that the current violation of a state or federal right is applicable to the entire class. Prospective relief must be modified upon the motion of a party whenever, and to the extent, the findings required by this section no longer apply to one or more provisions of the prospective relief then in effect. This subsection and the time limits provided in (d) of this section do not prevent a party from seeking modification or termination before the relief is otherwise terminable under this section to the extent that modification or termination would otherwise be legally permissible.

(d) A defendant may not file a motion to modify or terminate under (c) of this section until

(1) two years after the date the court ordered the prospective relief if the order occurred after August 30, 1999;

(2) one year after the date the court entered an order denying modification or termination of prospective relief made under (1) or (3) of this subsection; or

(3) in the case of an order issued on or before August 30, 1999, one year after August 30, 1999.

(e) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, in a civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions, a court may order prospective relief as provided in a consent decree without complying with (a) of this section, provided the prospective relief does not continue for a period of more than two years unless the court finds and orders that the continuation of the relief is appropriate under the standards in (c) of this section. In addition, parties may enter into private settlement agreements that do not comply with the limitations of relief set out in (a) of this section if the terms of the agreements are not subject to court enforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceedings that the agreements settled.

(f) The court shall promptly rule on a motion to modify or terminate prospective relief in a civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions. A motion to modify or terminate prospective relief made under this section stays the order for prospective relief beginning on the 90th day after the motion is filed, and the stay ends on the date the court enters a final order ruling on the motion. An automatic stay under this subsection may be postponed by the court for not more than 30 days for good cause.

(g) In this section,

(1) "civil action with respect to correctional facility conditions" means a civil proceeding arising under state or federal law with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of persons confined in correctional facilities;

(2) "consent decree" means a court order that is based on the agreement of the parties; the term "consent decree" does not include a private settlement agreement;

(3) "prisoner"

(A) means a person held in a state correctional facility or under authority of state or municipal law in official detention as defined in AS 11.81.900(b);

(B) includes a minor committed to the custody of the commissioner when,

(i) under AS 47.12.030, 47.12.065, or 47.12.100, the minor has been charged, prosecuted, or convicted as an adult; or

(ii) under AS 47.12.160(e), the minor has been ordered transferred to the custody of the commissioner of corrections or a municipality;

(4) "private settlement agreement" means an agreement entered into among the parties that is not subject to judicial enforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceeding that the agreement settled;

(5) "prospective relief" means all relief other than compensatory monetary damages;

(6) "relief" means any legal or equitable remedy in any form that may be ordered by the court, and includes a consent decree but does not include a private settlement agreement;

(7) "state or federal right" means a right arising from the United States Constitution, the Constitution of the State of Alaska, or a federal or state statute.

(6) able to read or speak the English language.

(b) A person is not disqualified from serving as a juror solely because of the loss of hearing or sight in any degree or a disability that substantially impairs or interferes with the person's mobility.

###### Sec. 09.20.020.   Disqualification of jurors.

A person is disqualified from serving as a juror if the person

(1) has served as a juror in the state within one year of the time of examination for service; or

(2) has been convicted of a felony for which the person has not been unconditionally discharged; unconditional discharge has the meaning given in AS 12.55.185.

###### Sec. 09.20.025.   Limitation on jury service.

A person may not be required to serve more than a total of three months as a juror during any consecutive two-year period. However, if a person is serving as a juror at the conclusion of the three months period, that person shall complete the trial then in progress.  In this section, a person is "serving as a juror" whenever that person is in attendance in court as a member of a jury or a jury panel.

###### Sec. 09.20.030.   Exemptions.

(a) A person may claim exemption and may be excused from service as a juror if it is shown that the person's health, the health or proper care of the person's family, a permanent physical or mental disability, or other substantial hardship expected to last more than two years makes it necessary for the person to be excused, or if the person is a judicial officer.

(b) A person may claim exemption and shall be excused by the court from service as a juror during the school term if it is shown that the person is a teacher in a school that is designated as a low performing school under regulations adopted by the state Board of Education and Early Development. In this subsection, "teacher" means a person who serves a school district in a teaching capacity in a classroom setting and is required to be certificated in order to hold the position.

###### Sec. 09.20.035.   Deferral of jury service.

A person may have jury service deferred if the person shows that jury service at the time for which the person is summoned will cause hardship to that person or another, that transportation problems make it temporarily impossible for the person to serve, or that the person summoned is employed as a full-time or temporary election official and the jury service is during the month in which a primary or general election is held. Jury service may be deferred under this section only if the person seeking the deferment agrees to a deferred date. Jury service may not be deferred for more than 10 months from the date the initial jury service was to begin.

###### Sec. 09.20.037.   Protection for employee on jury duty.

(a) An employer may not deprive an employee of employment or threaten, coerce, or penalize an employee because the employee receives or responds to a summons for jury service, serves as a juror, or attends court for prospective jury service. This section does not require an employer to pay wages to an employee for time spent on jury service or in court for prospective jury service.

(b) If an employer violates this section, the employee may bring a civil action to recover wages lost as a result of the violation, other damages that resulted from the violation, and may also seek an order requiring the reinstatement of the employee.

###### Sec. 09.20.040.   Compliance with statute.

The selection of jurors shall be made in substantial compliance with AS 09.20.040§09.20.090. A failure in substantial compliance that prejudices the rights of a party is reversible error.

###### Sec. 09.20.050.   Jury list.

(a) At such times as need may require, but not later than November 30 of each year, the administrative director of the Alaska Court System shall prepare for each judicial district a list of the names of the residents of the district who are qualified by law for jury service. If the superior court is located in different cities in the same judicial district, the administrative director shall prepare for each location of the court a list of the names of the qualified residents of that portion of the district considered to be appropriate.

(b) The jury list shall be based on a list prepared by the Department of Revenue of all persons who filed an application for a distribution of Alaska permanent fund income under AS 43.23 during the current calendar year that shows an Alaska address, and of all persons who volunteer for jury duty under (d) of this section. If considered necessary by the administrative director of the Alaska Court System, the jury list shall incorporate a list prepared by the Department of Administration of all persons who hold a valid Alaska driver's license. The departments shall submit their respective lists to the Alaska Court System not later than September 30 of each year. To the extent that it is available, the departments shall include on the lists they submit the following information for each person: first name, middle initial, and last name; mailing address, including the zip code; and birth date. The lists shall be recorded on magnetic tape compatible with Alaska Court System data processing equipment.

(c) A copy of the appropriate portion of the jury list shall be transmitted to the presiding judge of each judicial district and shall only be used to summon jurors and for other purposes of judicial administration. Duplicate names and the names of deceased persons and persons permanently excused from jury service shall be eliminated from the list before it is transmitted to the presiding judge. A questionnaire for prospective jurors may be adopted and submitted to them by the administrative director of the Alaska Court System.

(d) A person who is qualified as a juror under AS 09.20.010 and is not disqualified from serving as a juror by AS 09.20.020 may volunteer for jury duty by contacting the administrative director of the Alaska Court System and providing the information the administrative director may require.

###### Sec. 09.20.060.   Use of jury box or computer list.

The clerk of the court shall write the names included in the list on separate pieces of paper or prepare metal, plastic, or other types of pieces to correspond to numbers on the jury list.  As directed by the court, the clerk shall deposit the named or numbered pieces in the jury box in a number and manner to assure a fair and impartial drawing of the jury panel.  A randomly generated computer list of prospective jurors may be used in place of the jury box.  The jury box and the named or numbered pieces, or the computer list may be examined by the parties or by an attorney authorized to practice law in the state within limitations and under conditions prescribed by the court.

###### Sec. 09.20.070.   Public drawing for jurors for panel.

Under the direction of the court the clerk shall conduct the public drawing of jurors for the panel by shaking the box to mix the named or numbered pieces. The clerk shall then draw as many names or numbers as are ordered by the court to fill the jury panel.  A random selection of the jury panel by computer may be used in place of the public drawing of names.  If the name or number of a person is drawn or selected and the person is deceased, unqualified, disqualified, or the person's attendance cannot be obtained within a reasonable time or may involve a large and unnecessary expense, and the fact appears to the satisfaction of the court through the use of questionnaires or otherwise, the court may reject the name of that person and direct that the name or number of another be drawn.

###### Sec. 09.20.080.   Jury panel.

(a) The jury panel for the trial of civil cases consists of at least twice the number of jurors needed to serve on a trial jury, including any needed alternate jurors.  If the number of jurors on the panel falls below the number required by this section or if the regular panel is exhausted, the court shall order the clerk to complete the panel or to secure additional jurors by drawing names from the jury box or by obtaining names from the randomly generated computer list.

(b) If the list of prospective jurors for a court location does not produce sufficient names for a jury panel of minimum size, the administrative director of the Alaska Court System may authorize that additional names of prospective jurors be randomly selected from sources other than those listed in AS 09.20.050.

###### Sec. 09.20.090.   Impaneling the trial jury.

When a civil case that is to be tried by a jury is called for trial, the clerk shall draw from the trial jury box containing the names of those on the jury panel a number of names or numbers sufficient to name a jury of 12 unless the court directs otherwise. The prospective jurors shall be examined, challenged, and sworn as provided by rules of the supreme court.

###### Sec. 09.20.100.   Verdicts.

In a civil case tried by a jury in any court, whether of record or not, not less than five-sixths of the jury may render a verdict, which is entitled to the legal effect of a unanimous verdict at common law. Special verdicts need not be concurred in by the same jurors.

#### Article 2. Witnesses.

###### Sec. 09.20.110.   Service on concealed witness.

If a witness is concealed in a building or vessel for the purpose of preventing the service of a subpoena, a peace officer may break into the building or vessel to serve the subpoena upon the witness.

###### Sec. 09.20.120.   Disobedience to subpoena.

A witness who disobeys a subpoena served on the witness shall also forfeit to the party requiring the attendance of the witness the sum of $50 and all damages which that party may sustain by the failure of the witness to attend.  The forfeiture and damages may be recovered in a civil action.

###### Sec. 09.20.130.   Proceedings for examination of prisoner as a witness.

(a) If a witness is a prisoner confined in a prison in the state, a state court may order the prisoner's temporary removal and production before a state court for the purpose of being orally examined

(1) by the court or a judge of the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, unless it is a district court;

(2) by a judge of the superior or supreme court when the action or proceeding is pending in a district court, or when the witness's oral examination is required before a judge or other persons out of court.

(b) In any other case, a state court may order the examination in prison upon a deposition.

###### Sec. 09.20.140.   Compelling person to testify.

A person present in court or before a judicial officer may be required to testify in the same manner as if the person were in attendance before the court or officer on a subpoena.

###### Sec. 09.20.150.   Witnesses are exonerated from civil arrest.

A person who has been served in good faith with a subpoena to attend as a witness before a court, judge, referee, or other official is exonerated from arrest in a civil action while going to the place of attendance, necessarily remaining there, and returning from there.  The arrest of a witness contrary to this section is void, and when wilfully made is a contempt of court. The officer wilfully making it is responsible to the witness arrested for double the amount of damages that may be assessed against the witness, and is also liable to an action at the suit of the party serving the witness with the subpoena for the damages sustained by the party in consequence of the arrest.

###### Sec. 09.20.160.   Affidavit as prerequisite to officer's liability.

(a) The officer making the arrest is not liable in any way therefor unless the person claiming exoneration from arrest, if required, makes an affidavit stating that the person

(1) has been served a subpoena to attend as a witness before a court, judge, referee, or other official, specifying the same, the place of attendance, and the action or proceeding in which the subpoena was issued; and

(2) has not been served by the person's own procurement with the intention of avoiding an arrest.

(b) The affidavit may be taken by the officer, and exonerates the officer from liability for not making the arrest or for discharging the witness when arrested.

###### Sec. 09.20.170.   Discharge from improper arrest.

The court, judge, referee, or other person before whom the attendance of the witness is required may discharge a witness from an arrest made in violation of AS 09.20.150.

###### Sec. 09.20.180.   Exclusion of witnesses from courtroom.

Except as provided in AS 12.61.010 and AS 47.12.110(b), upon the request of either party the judge may exclude from the courtroom any witness of the adverse party not under examination at the time so that the witness may not hear the testimony of other witnesses.

###### Sec. 09.20.185.   Expert witness qualification.

(a) In an action based on professional negligence, a person may not testify as an expert witness on the issue of the appropriate standard of care unless the witness is

(1) a professional who is licensed in this state or in another state or country;

(2) trained and experienced in the same discipline or school of practice as the defendant or in an area directly related to a matter at issue; and

(3) certified by a board recognized by the state as having acknowledged expertise and training directly related to the particular field or matter at issue.

(b) The provisions of (a) of this section do not apply if the state has not recognized a board that has certified the witness in the particular field or matter at issue.

(1) an agreement that by its terms is not to be performed within a year from the making of it;

(2) an agreement the performance of which is not to be completed by the end of a lifetime; this provision includes a contract to bequeath property or make a testamentary disposition of any kind, a contract to assign or an assignment, with or without consideration to the promisor, of a life or health or accident insurance policy, or a promise, with or without consideration to the promisor, to name a beneficiary of that type of policy; but this provision does not include an insurer's promise to issue a policy of insurance, or any promise or assignment with respect to a policy of industrial life or health or accident insurance;

(3) a special promise to answer for the debt of another;

(4) an agreement by an executor or administrator to pay the debts of the testator or intestate out of the personal estate of the executor or administrator;

(7) an agreement concerning real property made by an agent of the party sought to be charged unless the authority of the agent is in writing;

(8) an agreement authorizing or employing an agent or broker to sell or purchase real estate for compensation or commission; however, if the note or memorandum of the agreement is in writing, subscribed by the party to be charged or by a lawfully authorized agent, contains a description of the property sufficient for identification, authorizes or employs the agent or broker named in it to sell the property, and expresses with reasonable certainty the amount of the commission or compensation to be paid the agent or broker, the agreement of authorization or employment is not unenforceable for failure to state a consideration;

(9) an agreement to establish a trust;

(10) a subsequent or new promise to pay a debt discharged in bankruptcy;

(11) a conveyance or assignment of a trust in personal property;

(12) an agreement to pay compensation for services rendered in negotiating a loan, effecting the procurement of a business opportunity, or the purchase and sale of a business, its good will, inventory, fixtures, or an interest in it, including a majority of the voting stock interest in a corporation and including the creating of a partnership interest, other than an agreement to pay compensation to an auctioneer or an attorney at law;

(b) No estate or interest in real property, other than a lease for a term not exceeding one year, nor any trust or power concerning the property may be created, transferred, or declared, otherwise than by operation of law, or by a conveyance or other instrument in writing subscribed by the party creating, transferring, or declaring it or by that party's agent under written authority and executed with the formalities that are required by law.  If the estate or interest in real property is created, transferred, or declared to a nonresident alien or for the benefit of a nonresident alien, the instrument shall so state and shall contain the name and address of the alien.  This subsection does not affect the power of a testator in the disposition of real property by will, nor prevent a trust's arising or being extinguished by implication or operation of law, nor affect the power of a court to compel specific performance of an agreement in relation to the property.

###### Sec. 09.25.020.   Exceptions to statute of frauds.

(2) there is a memorandum that would satisfy the requirements of AS 09.25.010 except for error or omission in the recital of past events;

The following are the rules for construing the descriptive part of a conveyance of real property when the construction is doubtful and there are no other sufficient circumstances to determine it:

(1) where there are certain definite and ascertained particulars in the description, the addition of others which are indefinite, unknown, or false does not frustrate the conveyance, but it is to be construed by those particulars if they constitute a sufficient description to ascertain its application:

(2) when permanent and visible or ascertained boundaries or monuments are inconsistent with the measurement, either of lines, angles, or surfaces, the boundaries or monuments are paramount:

(3) between different measurements which are inconsistent with each other, that of angles is paramount to that of surfaces, and that of lines paramount to both:

(4) when a road or stream of water not navigable is the boundary, the rights of the grantor to the middle of the road or the thread of the stream are included in the conveyance, except where the road or bed of the stream is held under another title:

(5) when tidewater is the boundary, the rights of the grantor to low-water mark are included in the conveyance:

(6) when the description refers to a map and that reference is inconsistent with other particulars, it controls them if it appears that the parties acted with reference to the map; otherwise the map is subordinate to other definite and ascertained particulars.

(b) In this section,

(1) "deoxyribonucleic acid" means the molecules in all cellular forms that contain genetic information in a patterned chemical structure for each individual;

(2) "DNA profile"

This section may not be construed to modify or change in any manner corresponding provisions of AS 45.01§AS 45.08, AS 45.12, AS 45.14, and AS 45.29 (Uniform Commercial Code).

The court shall make or cause to be made whatever inquiry the court thinks necessary to a determination of the issue.

(b) The court may deny the privilege and may order the public official or the reporter to testify, imposing whatever limits upon the testimony and upon the right of cross-examination of the witness as may be in the public interest or in the interest of a fair trial, if it finds the withholding of the testimony would

When the issue is raised before the supreme or a superior court, the application must be made to that court.

(c) Application for an order shall be made by verified petition setting out the reasons why the disclosure is essential to the administration of justice, a fair trial in the instant proceeding, or the protection of the public interest.  Upon application, the court shall determine the notice to be given to the public official or reporter and fix the time and place of hearing.

###### Sec. 09.25.340.   Extent of privilege.

When a public official or reporter claims the privilege conferred by AS 09.25.300§09.25.390 and the public official or reporter has not been divested of the privilege by order of the supreme or superior court, neither the public official or reporter nor the news organization with which the reporter was associated may thereafter be permitted to plead or prove the sources of information withheld, unless the informant consents in writing or in open court.

(b) A party seeking an in camera review as provided under (a) of this section shall provide to the court or administrative hearing officer a factual basis adequate to support a good faith belief by a reasonable person that the documents or communications for which disclosure is sought are likely to reveal evidence to establish that an exception in (a) of this section applies.

(c) A party seeking disclosure of confidential self-evaluation and analysis during an in camera review under this section has the burden of proving that an exception in (a) of this section applies.

(5) cooperate with the department or municipality, as appropriate, in connection with an investigation of the issues identified in the disclosure; the department or municipality may request that the owner or operator allow the department or municipality to review, under a written claim of confidentiality as described in AS 09.25.455(b)(3), the part of the audit report that describes the implementation plan or tracking system developed to correct past noncompliance, improve current compliance, or prevent future noncompliance.

(e) A disclosure is not voluntary for purposes of this section if it is a disclosure to the department or municipality expressly required by an environmental law, a permit, a license, or an enforcement order or decree.

(f) Immunity under this section for violation of an environmental law is available only for a violation that is discovered as a result of information or documents first produced or obtained during the time period specified in the notice required under AS 09.25.450(b).

(g) During the period between receipt of the audit notice required under AS 09.25.450(b) and the specified end date of the audit, the department or municipality may not initiate an inspection, monitoring, or other investigative activity concerning the audited facility, operation, or property based on the receipt of a notice under AS 09.25.450. The department or municipality has the burden of proving that an inspection, monitoring, or other investigative activity concerning the audited facility, operation, or property initiated after receiving a notice under AS 09.25.450 was not initiated based on receiving the notice.

(h) A violation that has been voluntarily disclosed and to which immunity applies under this section shall be identified by the department or municipality in its compliance history report as having been voluntarily disclosed.

(i) This section may not be construed to prevent the department or municipality from

(1) seeking injunctive relief; or

(2) issuing an emergency order in a situation involving an imminent and substantial danger to public health or welfare or the environment.

###### Sec. 09.25.480.   Exceptions to immunity; mitigation.

(a) There is no immunity under AS 09.25.475 if a court or administrative hearing officer finds that

(1) the owner or operator claiming the immunity has

(A) intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly committed or authorized the violation;

(B) within the 36 months preceding the violation, committed, at the same facility or associated facilities located in the state, a pattern of violations that are the same as or closely related to the violation for which the immunity is sought; or

(C) not attempted to bring the facility, operation, or property into compliance so as to constitute a pattern of disregard of environmental laws;

(2) the violation was authorized or committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly by a member of the owner's or operator's management and the owner's or operator's policies contributed materially to the occurrence of the violation; or

(3) the owner or operator, after taking into account the cost of completing corrective and remedial measures within a reasonable time and implementing appropriate measures to prevent recurrence of the violation, realized substantial economic savings in not complying with the requirement for which a violation is charged; the exception to immunity in this paragraph applies only to that portion of a penalty that reflects the economic savings of noncompliance after taking into account the cost of completing the corrective, remedial, and preventive measures necessary to qualify for immunity.

(b) There is no immunity under AS 09.25.475 from an administrative or civil penalty for the violation of an administrative or court order or for violation of a term or condition of an administrative or court order.

(c) An administrative or civil penalty that is imposed on an owner or operator for violation of an environmental law when the owner or operator has made a voluntary disclosure under AS 09.25.475(a) but is not granted immunity because of (a) of this section may, to the extent appropriate and not prohibited by law, be mitigated by

(1) the good faith actions of the owner or operator in disclosing the violation;

(2) efforts by the owner or operator to conduct environmental audits and to complete any resulting implementation plan or tracking system for corrective and preventive action;

(3) remediation;

(4) cooperation with government officials investigating the disclosed violation;

(5) the nature of the violation; and

(6) other relevant considerations.

#### Article 1. Judgments.

## Chapter 30. Judgments.

###### Sec. 09.30.010.   Recording copy of judgment as lien.

A certified copy of the judgment or decree of a court of this state or a court of record of the United States upon which execution may issue, the enforcement of which has not been stayed, may be recorded with the recorder of a recording district.  From the recording, the judgment or decree becomes a lien upon the real property of the defendant that is in the recording district, that is not exempt from execution, and that is owned by the defendant at the time or acquired by the defendant afterward but before the lien expires.  The lien continues during the time execution may issue on the judgment or decree but for not more than 10 years from date of entry of the judgment or decree. After expiration of the lien, the court may grant leave for issuance of execution upon the judgment or decree.  From the date of recording the judgment or decree, together with the order allowing issuance of execution, the judgment or decree becomes a lien in the manner provided in this section.

###### Sec. 09.30.020.   Priority of lien of judgment.

A conveyance of real property or interest in real property is void against a judgment lien that is recorded before the conveyance is recorded.

###### Sec. 09.30.030.   Judgment where summons not served on all defendants.

When an action is against two or more defendants jointly indebted upon a contract and the summons is served on one or more but not all of them and judgment is recovered, it may be entered against all the defendants jointly indebted only so far as it may be enforced against the joint property of all and the separate property of the defendants served and, if they are subject to arrest, against the persons of the defendants served.

###### Sec. 09.30.040.   Judgments against boroughs and cities.

Where judgment is against a borough, city, or other public corporation, no execution may issue on it but the judgment may be satisfied only as follows:

(1) the party in whose favor the judgment is given may, at any time within 10 years of the date of the judgment, present a certified copy of the judgment to the officer of the borough, city, or other public corporation authorized to draw orders on its treasurer;

(2) upon presentation, the officer shall draw an order on the treasurer for the amount of the judgment in favor of the party for whom the judgment was given; after that the order may be presented for payment and paid in the manner and with the effect of other orders upon the treasurer of a borough, city, or other public corporation.

###### Sec. 09.30.050.   Confession of judgment.

A judgment by confession may be entered with or without action against a person for any amount or relief.  The confession may be made only by the confessor in person or by the person's attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney so authorizing, or, if the confessor is a corporation, only by a person who at that time has a relation to the corporation that would authorize the service of summons on that person.

###### Sec. 09.30.055.   [Renumbered as AS 09.30.065.]

###### Sec. 09.30.060.   Confession of judgment against jointly liable defendant.

When an action upon a contract is pending against one or more defendants jointly liable, judgment may be given on the confession of one or more defendants against all the defendants jointly liable, whether all defendants have been served with the summons or not.  However, the judgment may be enforced only against their joint property and against the joint and separate property of the defendant making the confession.

###### Sec. 09.30.065.   Offers of judgment.

(a) At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins, either the party making a claim or the party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be entered in complete satisfaction of the claim for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer, with costs then accrued. If within 10 days after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service, and the clerk shall enter judgment. An offer not accepted within 10 days is considered withdrawn, and evidence of that offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine the form of judgment after verdict. If the judgment finally entered on the claim as to which an offer has been made under this section is at least five percent less favorable to the offeree than the offer, or if there are multiple defendants at least 10 percent less favorable to the offeree than the offer, the offeree, whether the party making the claim or defending against the claim, shall pay all costs as allowed under the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure and shall pay reasonable actual attorney fees incurred by the offeror from the date the offer was made, as follows:

(1) if the offer was served no later than 60 days after both parties made the disclosures required by the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure, the offeree shall pay 75 percent of the offeror's reasonable actual attorney fees;

(2) if the offer was served more than 60 days after both parties made the disclosures required by the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure but more than 90 days before the trial began, the offeree shall pay 50 percent of the offeror's reasonable actual attorney fees;

(3) if the offer was served 90 days or less but more than 10 days before the trial began, the offeree shall pay 30 percent of the offeror's reasonable actual attorney fees.

(b) If an offeror receives costs and reasonable actual attorney fees under (a) of this section, that offeror shall be considered the prevailing party for purposes of an award of attorney fees under the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure. Notwithstanding (a) of this section, if the amount awarded an offeror for attorney fees under the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure is greater than a party would receive under (a) of this section, the offeree shall pay to the offeror attorney fees specified under the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure and is not required to pay reasonable actual attorney fees under (a) of this section. A party who receives attorney fees under this section may not also receive attorney fees under the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure.

###### Sec. 09.30.070.   Interest on judgments; prejudgment interest.

(a) Notwithstanding AS 45.45.010, the rate of interest on judgments and decrees for the payment of money, including prejudgment interest, is three percentage points above the 12th Federal Reserve District discount rate in effect on January 2 of the year in which the judgment or decree is entered, except that a judgment or decree founded on a contract in writing, providing for the payment of interest until paid at a specified rate not exceeding the legal rate of interest for that type of contract, bears interest at the rate specified in the contract if the interest rate is set out in the judgment or decree.

(b) Except when the court finds that the parties have agreed otherwise and except as provided by AS 45.05.111(d), prejudgment interest accrues from the day process is served on the defendant or the day the defendant received written notification that an injury has occurred and that a claim may be brought against the defendant for that injury, whichever is earlier. The written notification must be of a nature that would lead a prudent person to believe that a claim will be made against the person receiving the notification, for personal injury, death, or damage to property.

(c) Prejudgment interest may not be awarded for future economic damages, future noneconomic damages, or punitive damages.

#### Article 2. Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act.

If the defendant satisfies the court either that an appeal is pending or that the defendant is entitled and intends to appeal from the foreign judgment, the court may stay the proceedings until the appeal has been determined or until the expiration of a period of time sufficient to enable the defendant to prosecute the appeal.

###### Sec. 09.30.150.   Saving clause.

AS 09.30.100§09.30.180 do not prevent the recognition of a foreign judgment in situations not covered by AS 09.30.100§09.30.180.

###### Sec. 09.30.300.   Satisfaction of judgment.

(a) Satisfaction of a judgment may be entered upon an execution returned satisfied, or upon an acknowledgment of satisfaction filed with the clerk, which may recite payment of the judgment in full or the acceptance by the judgment creditor of any lesser sum in full satisfaction of the judgment, made in the manner of an acknowledgment of a conveyance of real property by the judgment creditor or assignee of record, or by the attorney for the judgment creditor or assignee unless a revocation of the attorney's authority is filed.  When a judgment is satisfied otherwise than upon an execution, the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor's attorney shall deliver a written acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment suitable for recordation immediately upon payment in cash or within 10 days after payment if payment is made in any other manner, and, upon motion, the court may compel an acknowledgment of satisfaction or may order the entry of satisfaction to be made without it.  When the state or an authorized officer or agency of the state is the judgment creditor, a written acknowledgment of satisfaction shall be delivered within 15 days after payment in cash or within 30 days after payment if payment is made in any other manner. The entry of satisfaction shall be made upon the civil docket of the court rendering the judgment satisfied.

(b) A judgment creditor or assignee who, after payment in full of the judgment and after written demand by the judgment debtor, fails without just cause for a period of 30 days to execute and file an acknowledgment of satisfaction with the court is liable to the judgment debtor or the grantees or heirs of the judgment debtor for all damages that may be sustained by reason of that failure and shall also forfeit to the judgment debtor or the grantees or heirs of the judgment debtor the sum of $100.

(3) if the writ is against the person of an absconding judgment debtor, it shall require the officer or person to arrest the debtor and commit the debtor to jail until the judgment is paid, with interest, or is discharged according to law; if the writ is against the person of any judgment debtor and the application for the writ is made under oath, upon probable cause, and describing the things to be seized as in a warrant, the officer may search and seize valuables from that debtor;

(4) if the writ is for the delivery of the possession of real or personal property, it shall require the officer or person to deliver the possession of the property, describing it, to the party entitled to it, and may at the same time require the officer or person to satisfy any costs, charges, damages, rents, or profits recovered by that judgment out of the personal property of the person against whom it was rendered, and the value of the property for which the judgment was recovered to be specified in the writ, if a delivery cannot be had; and, if sufficient personal property cannot be found, then out of the real property as provided in (1) of this section.

(b) In addition to the notice required by (a) of this section, notice of the sale of real property on execution shall be given by publishing a notice of the sale on an Internet website beginning at least 45 days before the date of the sale. Publication of the notice must begin not later than the first day that the notice is published under (a)(2) of this section and must continue at least through the day in the fourth week that the notice is published under (a)(2) of this section.

###### Sec. 09.35.150.   Sale.

All sales of property upon execution shall be made at auction between nine o'clock in the morning and four o'clock in the afternoon.  After sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the execution, no more may be sold.  Neither the officer holding the execution nor a deputy may become a purchaser or be interested in a purchase at the sale.  When the sale is of personal property capable of manual delivery, it shall be within view of those who attend the sale unless the court directs the sale to be at some other place.  The property shall be sold in parcels that are likely to bring the highest price. When the sale is of real property consisting of several known lots or parcels, they shall be sold separately or otherwise, as is likely to bring the highest price.  When a portion of real property is claimed by a third person, that person may require it to be sold separately.

###### Sec. 09.35.160.   Postponement of sale.

(a) If, at the time appointed for the sale, the person conducting it considers it to the advantage of all concerned to postpone the sale for want of purchasers, or other sufficient cause, the sale may be postponed from time to time, but each postponement may not exceed one week. Notice of every postponement shall be made by public proclamation.  Whenever a request in writing is made by the judgment creditor for a postponement of the sale to a later date and hour and is given to the person conducting the sale, that person shall by public declaration postpone the sale to the date and hour so fixed.

(b) If for any reason the sale cannot be held at the time appointed or within 30 days from the original sale date in the case of real property, the officer who is to conduct the sale shall notify the parties or their attorneys and designate a future day for the sale and give notice in the manner provided in AS 09.35.140.

When the purchaser of personal property capable of manual delivery and not in the possession of a third person, association, or corporation pays the purchase money, the peace officer shall deliver the property to the purchaser, and if desired, shall give the purchaser a bill of sale containing an acknowledgment of the payment.  In all other sales of personal property, the peace officer shall give the purchaser a bill of sale with the like acknowledgment.

###### Sec. 09.35.180.   Confirmation of sale or resale.

(a) Where real property executed upon has been sold, the judgment creditor may, upon motion, apply for an order confirming the sale.  The judgment debtor may object to the confirmation of the sale on the grounds that there were substantial irregularities in the proceedings of sale that caused probable loss or injury to the judgment debtor.

(b) If the court finds that there were substantial irregularities in the proceedings concerning the sale to the probable loss or injury of the party objecting, it shall deny the motion and direct that the property be resold in whole or in part as upon an execution.

(c) Upon a resale, the bid of the purchaser at the former sale shall be considered to be renewed and continued in force, and no bid may be taken except for a greater amount.  If the property sells to a person other than the former purchaser, the former purchaser shall be repaid out of the proceeds of the resale.

(d) An order confirming a sale is a conclusive determination of the regularity of the proceedings concerning the sale, as to all persons, in any other action or proceeding.

###### Sec. 09.35.190.   Eviction of purchaser.

If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or a successor in interest is evicted from the property because of irregularities in the proceedings concerning the sale or the reversal or discharge of the judgment, the purchaser or a successor may recover the price paid with interest, costs, and disbursements from the judgment creditor.

###### Sec. 09.35.200.   Contribution among joint judgment debtors.

When property liable to an execution against several persons is sold and more than a due proportion of the judgment is satisfied out of the proceeds of the sale of the property of one of them or one of them pays more than a due proportion without a sale, that person may compel contributions from the others.  When a judgment is against several and is upon an obligation of one of them as security for another and the surety pays the amount or a part of it, either by sale of the surety's property or before sale, the surety may compel repayment from the principal.  In that case, the person so paying or contributing is entitled to the benefit of the judgment to enforce contribution or repayment if the person files notice of payment and claim to contribution or repayment with the court where the judgment was rendered within 30 days after the payment.

###### Sec. 09.35.210.   Absolute sales and right of redemption.

Sales of real property, when the estate is less than a leasehold of two years unexpired term, are absolute.  In all other cases, the real property or interest in real property is subject to redemption. The person conducting the sale shall give to the purchaser a certificate of the sale that indicates the date of the judgment under which the sale was made and contains

(3) the whole price paid; and

(4) whether or not the property is subject to redemption.

(1) the judgment debtor; and

(2) a creditor having a lien by judgment or mortgage on the property sold or on some part of it subsequent in time to that on which the property was sold; a lien creditor after having redeemed the property is a redemptioner.

###### Sec. 09.35.230.   Redemption by lien creditor from purchaser.

A lien creditor may redeem the property at any time within 60 days after the date of the order confirming the sale on paying the amount of the purchase money, with interest at the rate of eight percent a year from the date of the sale, together with the amount of taxes and the expenses under AS 09.35.300(b) that the purchaser may have paid.  If the purchaser is also a creditor having a lien prior to that of the redemptioner, the redemptioner shall also pay the amount of that lien with interest.  When unpatented mining claims are redeemed, taxes include the annual assessment work required by law to be performed.

###### Sec. 09.35.240.   Subsequent redemptions.

The property may be again, and as often as a lien creditor or redemptioner is disposed, redeemed from the previous redemptioner within 60 days after the last redemption on paying the sum paid on the last redemption, with interest at eight percent a year from the date of the last redemption, together with the taxes and expenses under AS 09.35.300(b) that the last redemptioner may have paid and the amount of any liens held by the last redemptioner previous to the lien of the last redemptioner.

###### Sec. 09.35.260.   Conveyance of property.

If no redemption is made within the time prescribed, the purchaser or last redemptioner is entitled to a conveyance. If the judgment debtor redeems, the effect of the sale is terminated and the estate of the judgment debtor is restored.

###### Sec. 09.35.270.   Procedure for redemption.

(a) Redemption is made by paying the sum required to the peace officer.  Upon a redemption, the peace officer shall give the person redeeming a certificate of redemption containing the sum paid on redemption, from whom redeemed, and the date of such redemption, and the peace officer shall immediately give notice of the redemption to the party from whom redeemed.

(b) A judgment debtor or redemptioner shall submit to the peace officer

(1) a copy of the judgment under which the right to redeem is claimed, certified by the clerk of the court; or, if the redemption is upon a mortgage, the certificate of the record of the mortgage;

(2) a copy of any assignment necessary to establish the claim, verified by the affidavit of the claimant or an agent;

(3) an affidavit by the claimant or an agent showing the amount then actually due on the judgment or mortgage.

###### Sec. 09.35.280.   Priority of redemption.

If more than one person applies to the peace officer at the same time to redeem, the person having the prior lien is entitled to redeem first.

###### Sec. 09.35.290.   Redemption payment or refusal to permit redemption.

The peace officer shall immediately pay the money over to the person from whom the property is redeemed. A person's right to redeem may not be prejudiced by the refusal of the peace officer to allow the redemption.

###### Sec. 09.35.300.   Waste.

(a) Until the expiration of the time allowed for redemption, the court may restrain the commission of waste on the property by order granted with or without notice on the application of the purchaser or judgment creditor.  It is not waste for the person in possession of the property at the time of sale or entitled to possession afterwards to continue to use it during the period allowed for redemption in the same manner in which it was previously used, or to use it in the ordinary course of husbandry, or to make the necessary repairs to buildings or fences, or to use wood or timber on the property for the repairs or for fuel for the family of the person in possession during occupancy.

(b) The purchaser at the execution sale or a subsequent purchaser may apply to the court for permission to make necessary repairs to preserve the property against waste or to insure the property against loss during the redemption period.  If ordered by the court, the person making the necessary repairs or paying the insurance is entitled to reimbursement for the expenses from the person redeeming the property under this chapter.

###### Sec. 09.35.310.   Rights of purchaser and redemptioner.

The purchaser, from the time of sale until a resale or a redemption, or a redemptioner, from the time of redemption until another redemption, is entitled to the possession of the property purchased or redeemed.  Where the property is in the possession of a tenant, the purchaser or redemptioner is entitled to receive the rents of the property or the value of the use and occupation of the property.

The court may order a peace officer to arrest the judgment debtor and bring the debtor before the court upon satisfactory proof that the debtor is leaving the state with intent to defraud the debtor's creditors or is absconding.  Upon being brought before the court, the judgment debtor may be ordered to enter into an undertaking with one or more sufficient sureties that the debtor will appear before the court when directed, and that the debtor will not, during the pendency of the proceedings, dispose of any portion of the debtor's property not exempt from execution.  In default of entering into the undertaking, the judgment debtor may be committed to jail.

If there are multiple owners of property exempt as a homestead, the value of the exemption of each individual owner may not exceed the individual owner's pro rata portion of $54,000.

(c) If property that includes a homestead is sold under an execution, the sale becomes effective upon confirmation by order of the court.  The court shall enter the order of confirmation unless, within 60 days after the sale, the individual repurchases the property under this section or the court extends the time for confirmation upon the filing of a timely motion by a party in interest.  The individual may repurchase property, including that individual's homestead, at a sale on execution before confirmation by paying into court the costs of the sale plus the lesser of either (1) the difference between the highest bid and the amount of the exemption in the property, or (2) the amount of the creditor's claim. If the individual does not exercise the repurchase right under this subsection, the clerk of the court shall first remit an amount determined to be exempt to the individual from the proceeds of sale and the balance less the cost of the sale to the creditor. For the purpose of collecting an amount remaining unpaid on a judgment after repurchase of property by an individual under this subsection, the creditor or the creditor's assignee may not make another levy on the property repurchased.

(d) Upon entry of the order of confirmation under (c) of this section and expiration of the time period for repurchase, the clerk may execute a deed to the property and when delivered it shall be sufficient to convey all title of the individual in the premises sold to the purchaser at the sale.

###### Sec. 09.38.035.   Continuing lien on wages.

(a) In the case of a garnishment of earnings, when the garnishee's answer reflects that the defendant is employed by the garnishee, the judgment or balance due as reflected on the writ of garnishment shall become a lien on earnings due at the time of service of the writ to the extent that they are not exempt from garnishment, and that lien shall continue as to subsequent nonexempt earnings until the total subject to the lien equals the amount stated on the writ of garnishment, except that the lien on subsequent earnings shall terminate sooner if the employment relationship is terminated, if the underlying judgment is vacated, modified, or satisfied in full, or if the writ is dismissed.

(b) A garnishee shall pay into court all nonexempt earnings of the defendant subject to the continuing lien under (a) of this section.

###### Sec. 09.38.040.   Priorities between continuing liens.

A lien obtained under AS 09.38.035 has priority over any subsequent garnishment lien or wage assignment.  A writ creating a continuing lien served upon an employer while a continuing lien imposed by a previous writ is still in effect shall be answered by the employer with a statement that the employer is holding no funds and with a further statement stating when all previous liens are expected to terminate. The subsequent writ has full effect from the termination of all prior liens or until it is otherwise terminated under AS 09.38.035.  However, a subsequent writ is not effective if a writ in the same cause of action is pending at the time of service of garnishment.

###### Sec. 09.38.045.   Effective date of continuing lien.

The effective date of a writ creating a continuing lien is the date of service upon the garnishee. However, if there are, on that date, liens by virtue of previous writs, the effective date is the date all previous writs terminate.

The court shall determine the exemption amount after consideration of the individual's responsibilities and all the present and anticipated property and income of the individual, including that which is exempt.

(b) The exemption amounts under AS 09.38.030 may be increased when the individual submits an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, stating that the individual's earnings alone support the individual's household; by so doing, the maximum part of the individual's aggregate disposable earnings for any week subject to execution may not exceed the amount by which the individual's disposable earnings for that week exceed $550, or, if the individual is claiming an exemption for cash or other liquid assets under AS 09.38.030(b), a maximum amount of $2,200 available in a month is exempt.

An individual is entitled to an exemption of proceeds from the voluntary sale of an exempt homestead under AS 09.38.010 that are traceable for six months after the proceeds are received.  The exemption of proceeds under this subsection does not entitle the individual to claim an aggregate exemption in excess of the value limitation otherwise allowable under AS 09.38.010 or 09.38.020.

(b) Money or other property and proceeds exempt under this chapter are traceable under this section by application of the principle of first-in first-out, last-in first-out, or any other reasonable basis for tracing selected by the individual claiming the exemption.

###### Sec. 09.38.065.   Claims enforceable against exempt property.

(b) Except as provided in AS 09.38.070 limiting the enforcement of certain security interests, this chapter does not affect any statutory lien or security interest in exempt property.

(c) A creditor having a claim enforceable under (a) of this section against exempt property, before, at the time of, or a reasonable time after making a levy on property of an individual, shall serve on the individual a notice of the levy and of the basis for the creditor's right to make a levy on exempt property.

(b) Unless the individual, after receiving written notice of the individual's rights under this section, voluntarily surrenders to the secured creditor possession of an item of goods to which this section applies, the creditor may not take possession of the item or otherwise enforce the security interest according to its terms without an order or process of court.

(c) The court may order or authorize process respecting any item of goods to which this section applies only after a hearing, upon notice to the individual of the hearing and of the individual's rights at it.  The notice shall be as directed by the court.  The order or authorization may prescribe appropriate conditions as to payments upon the debt secured or otherwise. The court may not order or authorize process respecting the item if it finds upon the hearing both that the individual lacks the means to pay all or part of the debt secured and that continued possession or use of the item is necessary to avoid undue hardship for the individual or a dependent.

(d) The court, upon application of the creditor or the individual and notice to the other and after a hearing and finding of changed circumstances, may vacate or modify an order or authorization under this section.

###### Sec. 09.38.075.   Special procedures relating to limited value exemptions; burden of proof.

(a) Unless a creditor is seeking collection of a claim enforceable against exempt property under AS 09.38.065, the creditor may obtain a levy on an individual's property of a kind listed in AS 09.38.020 only by complying with this section. Before levy, the creditor shall file with the court out of which the process issues

(1) an affidavit stating that the creditor has reason to believe the individual has property of a kind listed in AS 09.38.020 that is not exempt, identifying the property, setting out facts constituting the basis for believing the property is not exempt; and

(2) a request for an order by the court notifying the individual

(A) of the creditor's claim of a right to levy on the property identified as nonexempt;

(B) of the individual's right to contest the creditor's claim of a right to levy by filing with the clerk of the court, on or before a date fixed by the court, but not exceeding 15 days after the issuance of the order, a written objection to the proposed levy and a statement of the grounds for the objection and of the right to describe the property in lieu of setting its value;

(C) of the possible consequences of failure to respond to the notice as provided in (c) of this section; and

(D) of the information required by AS 09.38.085(a).

(b) Notice of an order issued in accordance with a request under (a) of this section, together with the creditor's affidavit, shall be served on the individual.  The order shall restrain the individual from removing, encumbering, damaging, or disposing of any property of the kind listed in AS 09.38.020 for 30 days after receipt of the order, unless the court reduces, extends, or otherwise modifies the restraining order during the 30-day period.

(c) If exemption of property identified in a notice served on an individual under (b) of this section depends on its value, the individual may describe the property in the responsive statement and indicate the amount of any indebtedness chargeable against it.  If the individual, within the time allowed by the order of the court, fails to respond to a notice served under (b) of this section that the creditor believes the debtor has nonexempt property of a kind listed under AS 09.38.020, the court may order the individual to appear and disclose the description, location, and value of the individual's property.  If the individual fails to appear and disclose the information specified in the order, the individual waives objection to the creditor's levy on property of that kind.

(d) Except to the extent the procedure is prescribed by this section, AS 09.38.080(e) governs a proceeding for the determination of a contest in respect to a claim to exemption of property under AS 09.38.020.

(e) Costs incurred in making, or proposing to make, a levy on property of a kind listed in AS 09.38.020 shall be paid out of the proceeds of a sale of property of that kind.  If the proceeds of a sale of the property are insufficient to cover the costs incurred in proceedings commenced under this section, the creditor shall pay the costs and may not recover them from the individual, notwithstanding any agreement of the parties to the contrary.

(f) The burden of proving the validity of an exemption by a preponderance of the evidence is upon the individual claiming the exemption.

###### Sec. 09.38.080.   Procedures applicable to a levy on property of an individual.

(a) Except in a proceeding under AS 09.38.065, a creditor shall comply with this section in obtaining a levy on property of an individual.  In a proceeding to levy on personal property of a kind listed in AS 09.38.020, a creditor shall comply with this section and AS 09.38.075.

(b) Before, at the time of, or within three days after levy against property of an individual, the creditor shall file with the court from which the process issued an affidavit stating that the creditor has reason to believe the individual has property that is not exempt, identifying the property, and stating facts constituting the basis for that belief.

(c) Before, at the time of, or within three days after levy, the creditor shall serve on the individual a notice under AS 09.38.085, including a copy of the affidavit filed under (b) of this section.

(d) A bid for property that is less than the amount of the exempt value is not acceptable at a sale of property under a levy. If indebtedness secured by a valid lien is chargeable against the proceeds of the sale, the bid must exceed the amount of the indebtedness secured plus the amount of the exempt value. If a sufficient bid is not received, the officer shall file a notation of the fact with the clerk of the court and return the property to the individual.  The costs incurred during levy, offering the property for sale, and returning the property shall be assessed against the creditor and are not recoverable from the individual, notwithstanding any agreement of the parties to the contrary.

(e) If any question arises as to the rights of an individual entitled to an exemption under this chapter, an interested person may file with the clerk of the court from which the process issued a statement of the claim of exemptions and the question raised. The statement shall be referred to the court as soon as practicable thereafter.  The court shall order that notice of a hearing be given.  After hearing the matter, the court shall make findings and issue an appropriate order.  The court may award to the prevailing party costs of a proceeding under this subsection.

(f) An objection to levy on the ground that the property seized is exempt must be filed with the clerk of the court within 15 days after the levy.  The burden of proving the validity of an exemption by a preponderance of the evidence is upon the individual claiming the exemption.  Failure to file a timely objection may be held to be a waiver of a claim to exemption in the property, unless for cause shown the court excuses the failure.

###### Sec. 09.38.085.   Contents of notice; forms.

(a) The notice required by AS 09.38.075(b) and 09.38.080(c) must include the following information:

(b) The supreme court may prescribe forms to be used by creditors, debtors, and court officers under this chapter.

(c) A notice substantially complying with this section is effective even though the notice contains errors if those errors do not result in substantial prejudice to the rights of the individual debtor or of the dependents of the individual debtor.

###### Sec. 09.38.090.   Assertion of rights by another.

If an individual fails to select property entitled to be claimed as exempt or to object to a levy on the property or to assert any other right under this chapter, the spouse or a dependent of the individual or any other person authorized by law may make the claim or objection or assert the rights provided by this chapter.

###### Sec. 09.38.095.   Judicial relief.

(a) An individual or the spouse, a dependent of the individual, or any other person authorized by law is entitled to injunctive relief, damages, or both, against a creditor or other person to prevent or redress a violation of this chapter as provided in the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure.  A court may award costs and reasonable attorney fees to a party entitled to injunctive relief or damages.

(b) For cause shown the court may relieve a person from the consequences of failing to take timely action to assert rights under this chapter.

###### Sec. 09.38.100.   Debtor's property owned with another.

(a) If an individual and another own property in this state as tenants in common or tenants by the entirety, a creditor of the individual, subject to the individual's right to claim an exemption under this chapter, may obtain a levy on and sale of the interest of the individual in the property.  A creditor who has obtained a levy, or a purchaser who has purchased the individual's interest at the sale, may have the property partitioned or the individual's interest severed.

(b) A partner's right in specific partnership property is exempt except on a claim against the partnership.  If partnership property is attached for a partnership debt, the partners or any of them or the representatives of a deceased partner may not claim an exemption for that property under this chapter.

###### Sec. 09.38.105.   Waiver of exemption.

A waiver of exemption executed in favor of an unsecured creditor before levy on an individual's property is unenforceable, but a valid security interest may be given in exempt property.

###### Sec. 09.38.110.   Federal requirements.

If a federal department or agency issues a formal ruling that a section of this chapter relating to public assistance will cause a state plan for the delivery of services or benefits to be out of conformity with federal requirements, the section will not apply to the extent that it causes the program to be out of conformity with federal requirements.

###### Sec. 09.38.115.   Adjustment of dollar amounts.

(a) The dollar amounts in this chapter change, as provided in this section, according to and to the extent of changes in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers for the Anchorage Metropolitan Area compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor (the index).  The index for January of 1982 is the reference base index.

(b) The dollar amounts change on October 1 of each even-numbered year if the percentage of change, calculated to the nearest whole percentage point, between the index for January of that year and the most recent index used to change the exemption amount, is 10 percent or more, but

(1) the portion of the percentage change in the index in excess of a multiple of 10 percent is disregarded and the dollar amounts change only in multiples of 10 percent of the amounts appearing in this chapter on August 26, 1982; and

(2) the dollar amounts do not change if the amounts required by this section are those currently in effect as a result of earlier application of this section.

(c) If the index is revised, the percentage of change is calculated on the basis of the revised index.  If a revision of the index changes the reference base index, a revised reference base index is determined by multiplying the reference base index applicable by the rebasing factor furnished by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the index is superseded, the index referred to in this section is the one represented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as reflecting most accurately changes in the purchasing power of the dollar for Alaskan consumers.

(d) The Department of Labor and Workforce Development shall adopt a regulation announcing

(1) on or before June 30 of each year in which dollar amounts are to change, the changes in dollar amounts required by (b) of this section; and

(2) promptly after the changes occur, changes in the index required by (c) of this section, including, if applicable, the numerical equivalent of the reference base index under a revised reference base index and the designation or title of any index superseding the index.

###### Sec. 09.43.010.   Arbitration agreements valid; application of article.

If found for the opposing party, the court shall order the parties to proceed to arbitration.

(c) If an issue subject to arbitration under the alleged agreement is involved in an action or proceeding pending in a court having jurisdiction to hear applications under (a) of this section, the application shall be made in that court. Otherwise the application may be made in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(e) An order for arbitration may not be refused on the ground that the claim in issue lacks merit or because a fault or ground for the claims sought to be arbitrated has not been shown.

###### Sec. 09.43.030.   Appointment of arbitrators by court.

If the arbitration agreement provides a method of appointment of arbitrators, this method shall be followed.

On application to the arbitrators by a party or, if an application to the court by a party is pending under AS 09.43.110§09.43.130 on submission to the arbitrators by the court under the conditions the court may order, the arbitrators may modify or correct the award upon the grounds stated in AS 09.43.130(a)(1) and (3), or for the purpose of clarifying the award.

(5) there was no arbitration agreement and the issue was not adversely determined in proceedings under AS 09.43.020 and the party did not participate in the arbitration hearing without raising the objection.

(b) The fact that the relief is such that it could not or would not be granted by a court of law or equity is not ground for vacating or refusing to confirm the award.

(c) An application under this section shall be made within 90 days after delivery of a copy of the award to the applicant. However, if the application is predicated upon corruption, fraud, or other undue means by either the opposing party or an arbitrator, it shall be made within 90 days after the grounds are known or should have been known.

(d) In vacating the award on grounds other than those stated in (a)(5) of this section the court may order a rehearing before new arbitrators chosen as provided in the agreement, or in the absence of a provision in the agreement, by the court in accordance with AS 09.43.030, or, if the award is vacated on grounds set out in (a)(3) or (4) of this section, the court may order a rehearing before the arbitrators who made the award or their successors appointed in accordance with AS 09.43.030.

(f) If the parties to an arbitration proceeding agree to the procedures of an arbitration organization or other procedures for challenges to arbitrators before an award is made, substantial compliance with those procedures is a condition precedent to an application to vacate an award on that ground under AS 09.43.500(a)(2).

###### Sec. 09.43.400.   Action by majority.

(2) a hearing on an application to vacate an award under AS 09.43.500(a)(1) or (2) if the applicant establishes prima facie that a ground for vacating the award exists.

(b) An arbitrator may decide a request for summary disposition of a claim or particular issue

(2) on request of one party to the arbitration proceeding if that party gives notice to all other parties to the proceeding and the other parties have a reasonable opportunity to respond.

(c) If an arbitrator orders a hearing, the arbitrator shall set a time and place and give notice of the hearing not less than five days before the hearing begins. Unless a party to the arbitration proceeding makes an objection to lack or insufficiency of notice not later than the beginning of the hearing, the party's appearance at the hearing waives the objection. On request of a party to the arbitration proceeding and for good cause shown, or on the arbitrator's own initiative, the arbitrator may adjourn the hearing from time to time as necessary but may not postpone the hearing to a time later than that fixed by the agreement to arbitrate for making the award unless the parties to the arbitration proceeding consent to a later date. The arbitrator may hear and decide the controversy on the evidence produced although a party who was notified of the arbitration proceeding did not appear. The court, on request, may direct the arbitrator to conduct the hearing promptly and render a timely decision.

(d) At a hearing under (c) of this section, a party to the arbitration proceeding has a right to be heard, to present evidence material to the controversy, and to cross-examine witnesses appearing at the hearing.

A subpoena shall be served in the manner for service of subpoenas in a civil action and, on application to the court by a party to the arbitration proceeding or the arbitrator, enforced in the manner for enforcement of subpoenas in a civil action.

(b) In order to make the proceedings fair, expeditious, and cost-effective, on request of a party to or witness in an arbitration proceeding, an arbitrator may permit a deposition of a witness to be taken for use as evidence at the hearing, including a witness who cannot be subpoenaed for or is unable to attend a hearing. The arbitrator shall determine the conditions under which the deposition is taken.

(c) An arbitrator may permit the discovery the arbitrator decides is appropriate in the circumstances, taking into account the needs of the parties to the arbitration proceeding and other affected persons and the desirability of making the proceeding fair, expeditious, and cost-effective.

(d) If an arbitrator permits discovery under (c) of this section, the arbitrator may order a party to the arbitration proceeding to comply with the arbitrator's discovery-related orders, issue subpoenas for the attendance of a witness and for the production of records and other evidence at a discovery proceeding, and take action against a noncomplying party to the extent a court could if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in this state.

(e) An arbitrator may issue a protective order to prevent the disclosure of privileged information, confidential information, trade secrets, and other information protected from disclosure to the extent a court could if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in this state.

(f) All laws compelling a person under subpoena to testify and all fees for attending a judicial proceeding, deposition, or discovery proceeding as a witness apply to an arbitration proceeding as if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in this state.

(g) The court may enforce a subpoena or discovery-related order for the attendance of a witness within this state and for the production of records and other evidence issued by an arbitrator in connection with an arbitration proceeding in another state upon conditions determined by the court so as to make the arbitration proceeding fair, expeditious, and cost-effective.

###### Sec. 09.43.450.   Judicial enforcement of preaward ruling by arbitrator.

If an arbitrator makes a preaward ruling in favor of a party to the arbitration proceeding, the party may request the arbitrator to incorporate the ruling into an award under AS 09.43.460. A prevailing party may apply to the court for an expedited order to confirm the award under AS 09.43.490, in which case the court shall summarily decide the application. The court shall issue an order to confirm the award unless the court vacates, modifies, or corrects the award under AS 09.43.500 or 09.43.510.

The court may extend or the parties to the arbitration proceeding may agree in a record to extend the time. The court or the parties may extend the time within or after the time specified or ordered. A party waives an objection that an award was not timely made unless the party gives notice of the objection to the arbitrator before receiving notice of the award.

###### Sec. 09.43.470.   Change of award by arbitrator.

(a) On motion to an arbitrator by a party to an arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator may modify or correct an award

(d) If an application to the court is pending under AS 09.43.490, 09.43.500, or 09.43.510, the court may submit the claim to the arbitrator to consider whether to modify or correct the award

(1) on a ground stated in AS 09.43.510(a)(1) or (3);

(b) An arbitrator may award reasonable attorney fees and other reasonable expenses of arbitration if the award is authorized by law in a civil action involving the same claim or by the agreement of the parties to the arbitration proceeding.

(c) As to all remedies other than those authorized by (a) and (b) of this section, an arbitrator may order the remedies the arbitrator considers just and appropriate under the circumstances of the arbitration proceeding. The fact that the remedy could not or would not be granted by the court is not a ground for refusing to confirm an award under AS 09.43.490 or for vacating an award under AS 09.43.500.

(d) An arbitrator's expenses and fees, together with other expenses, shall be paid as provided in the award.

After a party to an arbitration proceeding receives notice of an award, the party may apply to the court for an order confirming the award, at which time the court shall issue a confirming order unless the award is modified or corrected under AS 09.43.470 or 09.43.510 or is vacated under AS 09.43.500.

(3) the right of entry upon an occupation of land, and the right to take from the land earth, gravel, stones, trees, and timber as may be necessary for a public use.

###### Sec. 09.55.260.   Private property subject to be taken.

The private property that may be taken under AS 09.55.240§09.55.460 includes

(1) all real property belonging to any person;

(2) land belonging to the state or to an organized or unorganized borough, city, town, village, or other municipal division, whether incorporated or unincorporated, not appropriated to a public use;

(6) all classes of private property not enumerated may be taken for public use when the taking is authorized by law.

###### Sec. 09.55.265.   Taking of property under reservation void.

After April 14, 1966, no agency of the state may take privately-owned property by the election or exercise of a reservation to the state acquired under the Act of June 30, 1932, ch. 320,§5, as added July 24, 1947, ch. 313, 61 Stat. 418, and taking of property after April 14, 1966 by the election or exercise of a reservation to the state under that federal Act is void.

###### Sec. 09.55.266.   Existing rights not affected.

AS 09.55.265 may not be construed to divest the state of, or to require compensation by the state for, any right-of-way or other interest in real property that was taken by the state, before April 14, 1966, by the election or exercise of its right to take property through a reservation acquired under the Act of June 30, 1932, ch. 320,§5, as added July 24, 1947, ch. 313, 61 Stat. 418.

The platting authority may establish applicable review procedures and standards for a replat made for the purpose of a right-of-way acquisition or condemnation. Neither the adequacy of the municipal replat process or standards, if any, nor the failure of a municipality to follow its own replat process and standards shall deprive the state of the authority to exercise its power of eminent domain. Final approval of replat shall also be obtained. However, if a state agency clearly demonstrates an overriding state interest, a waiver of the municipal approval requirements in this section may be granted by the governor.

###### Sec. 09.55.280.   Entry upon land.

In all cases where land is required for public use, the state, the public entity, or persons having the authority to condemn, or its agents in charge of the use may enter upon the land and make examination, surveys, and maps and locate the boundaries; but it shall be located in the manner that will be most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury, and subject to the provisions of AS 09.55.300.  The entry shall constitute no cause of action in favor of the owners of the land except for injuries resulting from negligence, wantonness, or malice.

###### Sec. 09.55.290.   Jurisdiction.

Eminent domain proceedings may be commenced in the superior court.

###### Sec. 09.55.300.   Powers of court.

(a) The court has power

(1) to regulate and determine the place and manner of making the connections and crossings or of enjoying the common uses mentioned in AS 09.55.260(5), and of the occupying of canyons, passes, and defiles for railroad purposes, as permitted and regulated by law;

(2) to limit the amount of property sought to be condemned if, in its opinion, the quantity sought to be condemned is not necessary.

(b) If the court determines that the property is to be taken for a public use, and if all parties to the action do not object, the court shall appoint a master to determine the amount to be paid by the plaintiffs to each owner or other person interested in the property as compensation and damages by reason of the appropriation of the property.  If all parties to the action object to the appointment of a master the court shall proceed with a jury trial, unless the jury is waived by all parties to the action.

###### Sec. 09.55.310.   Hearing.

(a) The jury or master shall hear the allegations and evidence of persons interested and shall ascertain and assess the following:

(1) the value of the property sought to be condemned, and all improvements on it pertaining to the realty, and of each separate estate or interest in it; if it consists of different parcels, the value of each parcel and each estate or interest in each parcel shall be separately assessed;

(2) if the property sought to be condemned constitutes only a part of a larger parcel, the damages that will accrue to the portion not sought to be condemned by reason of its severance from the portion sought to be condemned, and the construction of the improvements in the manner proposed by the plaintiff;

(3) separately, how much the portion not sought to be condemned and each estate or interest in it will be benefited, if at all, by the construction of the improvements proposed by the plaintiff; and, if the benefit is equal to the damages assessed under (2) of this section, the owner of the parcel shall be allowed no damages except the value of the portion taken; but if the benefits are less than the damages so assessed, the former shall be deducted from the latter and the remainder shall be the only damages allowed in addition to the value;

(4) if the property sought to be condemned is for a railroad, the cost of good and sufficient fences along the line of the railroad, and the cost of cattle guards where fences may cross the line of the railroad.

(b) As far as practicable, compensation shall be assessed for each source of damages separately.

###### Sec. 09.55.320.   Right to jury trial as to damages and value of property.

An interested party may appeal the master's award of damages and valuation of the property, in which case there shall be a trial by jury on the question of the amount of damages and the value of the property, unless the jury is waived by the consent of all parties to the appeal.

###### Sec. 09.55.330.   Compensation and damages.

For the purpose of assessing compensation and damages, the right to them accrues at the date of issuance of the summons, and its actual value at that date is the measure of compensation of the property to be actually taken, and the basis of damages to property not actually taken but injuriously affected in the cases where the damages are allowed.  If an order is made letting the plaintiff into possession, as provided in AS 09.55.380, the compensation and damages awarded shall draw lawful interest from the date of the order. Improvements put upon the property after the date of the service of summons may not be included in the assessment of compensation or damages.

###### Sec. 09.55.340.   Defective title.

If the title attempted to be acquired is found to be defective from any cause, the plaintiff may again institute proceedings to acquire the same as provided in AS 09.55.240§09.55.460.

###### Sec. 09.55.350.   Time for paying compensation or damages and bond to build railroad fences and cattle guards.

The plaintiff shall, within 30 days after final judgment, pay the sum of money assessed.  If the use is for railroad purposes, the plaintiff may, at the time of or before the payment, elect to build the fences and cattle guards.  If the plaintiff so elects, the plaintiff shall execute to the defendant a bond, with one or more sureties to be approved by the court, in double the assessed cost of the same to build such fences and cattle guards within eight months from the time the railroad is built on the land taken.  If the bond is given, the plaintiff need not pay the cost of the fences and cattle guards.  In an action on the bond, the plaintiff may recover reasonable attorney fees.

###### Sec. 09.55.360.   Payment or deposit and execution.

Payment may be made to the defendants entitled to payment, or the money may be deposited in court for the defendants and be distributed to those entitled to it.  If the money is not so paid or deposited, the defendants may have execution as in civil cases. If the money cannot be obtained on execution, the court, upon a showing to that effect, shall set aside and annul the entire proceedings and restore possession of the property to the defendants if possession has been taken by the plaintiff.

###### Sec. 09.55.370.   Final order of condemnation.

When payments have been made and the bond given, if the plaintiff elects to give one as required by AS 09.55.350, the court shall make a final order of condemnation, which shall describe the property condemned and the purposes of the condemnation.  A copy of the order shall be recorded in the office of the recording district where the land is located, at which time the property described in the order vests in the plaintiff for the purposes specified in the order.

###### Sec. 09.55.380.   Order authorizing plaintiff to continue in or take possession.

Upon application of the plaintiff at any time after the jury's verdict has been returned or the master's report has been filed in the court, the court may make an order that, upon payment into court of the amount of damages assessed in the report or by the jury, the plaintiff, if already in possession of the property sought to be condemned, may continue in possession and, if not in possession, the court may authorize the plaintiff to take possession of the property and use and possess it until the final conclusion of the proceedings, and that all actions and proceedings against the plaintiff on that account be stayed until that time.  However, where an appeal is taken by the defendant, the court may also require the plaintiff to give a bond or undertaking with sufficient sureties before continuing or taking possession.  The bond or undertaking shall be approved by the court and shall be in the sum the court may direct, and conditioned to pay defendant any additional damages and costs given by the judgment over and above the amount assessed, and the damages which defendant sustains if the property is not taken for public uses.  For the purposes of this section the amount assessed as damages in the report or by the jury is considered as just compensation for the property appropriated until reassessed or changed in further proceedings. However, the plaintiff, by payment into court of the amount assessed or by giving security as above provided, is not precluded from an appeal, but may appeal in the manner and with the effect as if no money had been deposited or security given. If the plaintiff deposits the amount of the assessment and continues in possession or takes possession of the property and there is no dispute as to the ownership of the property, the defendant may at any time demand and receive from the court the money deposited, and the demand or receipt does not bar or preclude the defendant from the right of appeal. However, if the amount of the assessment is reduced on appeal by either party, the defendant who has received the amount of the assessment deposited is liable to the plaintiff for the difference between the amount received by the defendant and the amount finally assessed with legal interest from the time the defendant received the money deposited, and it may be recovered by action.

###### Sec. 09.55.390.   Acquisition of easements and additional powers of the court to require surrender of possession to plaintiff.

The right to take possession under this section is in addition to any other right to take possession provided in AS 09.55.240§09.55.460.  In proceedings for the acquisition of easements for the transmission and distribution of electric energy, communications, water, steam, and gas, the court may, upon motion and after a hearing, fix the time during which and the terms upon which the parties in possession are required to surrender possession to the plaintiff.  If the court finds that urgent public necessity requires, it may grant the plaintiff possession at any time after the action has been commenced. Notice of the hearing shall be as provided in the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure, except that, where service by publication is required, notice may be given at any time following the date of the last publication by registered mail addressed to the defendant and to parties in possession at their last known addresses as shown on the latest tax roll of the political subdivision in which the premises are located or as indicated by other evidence that shall be satisfactory to the court.

###### Sec. 09.55.400.   Deposit into court of estimated compensation and damages; costs and fees.

The order given under AS 09.55.390 requiring the parties in possession to surrender possession to the plaintiff shall require that the plaintiff deposit with the clerk of the court an amount of money determined by the court fairly to represent the estimated compensation and the estimated damages to the defendant and for the speedy occupation, including reasonable relocation costs if required.  In addition the court shall include in its order a further requirement that the plaintiff execute and file with the clerk of the court a bond, approved as to form and as to sufficiency of the sureties by the court, in an amount equal to the amount of money required to be deposited, conditioned upon payment to the defendant of additional damages and costs found to be due to the defendant in the action. Costs or attorney fees may not be assessed against the defendant in an action brought under AS 09.55.390.

###### Sec. 09.55.410.   Withdrawal of funds by party in interest.

The money deposited in the court or a part of it may be withdrawn by a party in interest in the manner provided in AS 09.55.440, and the court shall have the power to direct the payment of delinquent taxes and special assessments out of the amount determined to be just compensation and to make orders with respect to encumbrances, liens, rents, insurance, and other charges as are just and equitable.

###### Sec. 09.55.420.   Declaration of taking by state or municipality.

(a) Where a proceeding is instituted under AS 09.55.240§09.55.460 by the state, it may file a declaration of taking with the complaint or at any time after the filing of the complaint, but before judgment.  Where a proceeding is instituted under AS 09.55.240§09.55.460 by a municipality in the exercise of eminent domain for street or highway, off-street automobile parking facilities, school, sewer, water, telephone, electric, other utility, and slum clearance purposes or use granted to cities of the first class, the governing body of the municipality may exercise the power through the filing of a declaration of taking with the complaint or at any time after the filing of the complaint, but before judgment.  The declaration of taking procedure may not be used with relation to the property of rural electrification or telephone cooperatives or nonprofit associations receiving financial assistance from the federal government under the Rural Electrification Act; provided that no declaration of taking for off-street parking purposes may be used unless there has been public notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area for not less than once a week for four consecutive weeks followed by a full and complete public hearing held before the governing body of the first class city or municipality.

(b)  [Repealed,§15 ch 59 SLA 1982.]

###### Sec. 09.55.440.   Vesting of title and compensation.

(a) Upon the filing of the declaration of taking and the deposit with the court of the amount of the estimated compensation stated in the declaration, title to the estate as specified in the declaration vests in the plaintiff, and that property is condemned and taken for the use of the plaintiff, and the right to just compensation for it vests in the persons entitled to it. The compensation shall be ascertained and awarded in the proceeding and established by judgment. The judgment must include interest at the rate of 10.5 percent a year on the amount finally awarded that exceeds the amount paid into court under the declaration of taking. The interest runs from the date title vests to the date of payment of the judgment.

(b) Upon motion of a party in interest and notice to all parties, the court may order that the money deposited or a part of it be paid immediately to the person or persons entitled to it for or on account of the just compensation to be awarded in the proceedings. If the compensation finally awarded exceeds the amount of money deposited, the deposit shall be offset against the award. If the compensation finally awarded is less than the amount of money deposited, the court shall enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the proper parties for the amount of the excess.

###### Sec. 09.55.450.   Right of entry and possession.

(a) Upon the filing of the declaration of taking and the deposit of the estimated compensation, the court may, upon motion, fix the time during which and the terms upon which the parties in possession are required to surrender possession to the petitioner.

Where the party in possession withdraws any part of the award and remains in possession, the court may fix a reasonable rental for the premises to be paid by that party to the plaintiff during such possession.

(b) The court may direct the payment of delinquent taxes and special assessments out of the amount determined to be just compensation, and make orders with respect to encumbrances, liens, rents, insurance, and other charges as are just and equitable.

(c) The right to take possession and title in advance of final judgment where a declaration of taking is filed is in addition to any other rights to take possession provided in AS 09.55.240§09.55.460.

###### Sec. 09.55.460.   Effect of appeal.

(a) An appeal or a bond or undertaking given does not operate to prevent or delay the vesting of title to real property or the right to possession of it.

(b) The plaintiff may not be divested of a title or possession acquired except where the court finds that the property was not taken by necessity for a public use or purpose in a manner compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury.  In the event of that finding, the court shall enter the judgment necessary to (1) compensate the persons entitled to it for the period during which the property was in the possession of the plaintiff, (2) recover for the plaintiff any award paid to any person, and (3) order the plaintiff to restore the property to the condition in which it existed at the time of the filing of the declaration of taking unless such restoration is impossible, in which case the court shall award damages to the proper persons as compensation for any diminution in the value of the property caused by the plaintiff's wrongful possession.

#### Article 5. Official Bonds, Fines, and Forfeitures.

###### Sec. 09.55.470.   Suits on undertakings.

(a) The official undertaking or other security of a public officer to the state, a borough, city, town, or other municipal or public corporation of like character therein is considered a security to the state or to the borough, city, town, or other municipal or public corporation, as the case may be, and also to all persons severally for the official delinquency against which it is intended to provide.

(b) When a public officer, by official misconduct or neglect of duty, forfeits the officer's official undertaking or other security or renders the sureties liable upon the undertaking or other security, a person injured by the misconduct or neglect or who is by law entitled to the benefit of the security may maintain an action thereon in the person's own name against the officer and the sureties to recover the amount to which the person may be entitled.

###### Sec. 09.55.480.   Subsequent actions on same undertaking.

A judgment in favor of a party for one delinquency does not preclude the same or another party from maintaining another action on the same undertaking or other security for another delinquency.

###### Sec. 09.55.490.   Amount of judgment.

In an action upon an official undertaking or other security, if judgment has already been recovered against the surety therein other than by confession equal in the aggregate to the penalty or a part of the penalty of the undertaking or other security and if the recovery be established on the trial, judgment may not be given against the surety for an amount exceeding the penalty or such portion of the penalty as is not already recovered against the surety.

###### Sec. 09.55.500.   Actions for fines or forfeitures.

Fines and forfeitures may be recovered by an action in the name of the state or the officer or person to whom they were given by law, or in the name of the state, officer, or person who is authorized to prosecute for them.

###### Sec. 09.55.510.   Amount that may be claimed and recovered.

When an action is commenced for a penalty that by law is not to exceed a certain amount, the action may be commenced for that amount, and, if the judgment is given for the plaintiff, it may be for that amount or less, in the discretion of the court, in proportion to the offense.

###### Sec. 09.55.520.   Collusive judgment not a bar to another action.

Recovery of a judgment for a penalty or forfeiture obtained by collusion between the plaintiff and defendant with intent to save the defendant wholly or partially from the consequence contemplated by law in cases where penalty or forfeiture is given wholly or partly to the person who prosecutes, does not bar the recovery of a penalty or forfeiture by another person in a separate action.

#### Article 6. Medical Malpractice Actions.

###### Sec. 09.55.530.   Declaration of purpose.

The legislature considers that there is a need in the state to codify the law with regard to medical liability in order to establish that the law in the state  in this regard is the same as elsewhere.

###### Sec. 09.55.535.   Voluntary arbitration.

(a) A patient and any health care provider may execute an agreement to submit to arbitration any dispute, controversy, or issue arising out of care or treatment by the health care provider during the period that the agreement is in force or that has already arisen between the parties.  Execution of an agreement under this subsection by a patient may not be made a prerequisite to receipt of care or treatment by the health care provider.

(b) An agreement to arbitrate executed before care or treatment is provided must clearly provide in bold print on the face of the agreement that execution of the agreement by the patient is not a prerequisite to receiving care or treatment.  If this subsection is not complied with by the health care provider, the agreement to arbitrate is void.  The form to be used shall be approved in advance by the attorney general of the state to assure it fairly informs both parties to the agreement and properly protects their interests.

(c) The agreement must provide that the person receiving health care may revoke the agreement within 30 days after execution by notifying the health care provider in writing.  The period for revocation shall be tolled during any period that the person receiving health care is physically unable to execute a revocation.  The health care provider may not revoke the agreement after its execution.

(d) An arbitration agreement entered into by the parents or legal guardian of a minor person receiving health care is binding upon the minor person.

(e) An agreement to arbitrate between a patient and a hospital must be reexecuted each time a person is admitted to a hospital. The agreement may be extended by written agreement of all parties to apply to care after hospitalization. A person receiving outpatient care from a hospital or clinic or a member of a health maintenance organization may execute an agreement with the hospital that provides for continuation of the agreement for a continuing program of treatment or during continued membership.

(f) Upon the filing of a malpractice claim that is subject to an agreement to arbitrate, the claim shall be submitted to an arbitration board.  The arbitration board shall consist of three arbitrators: one arbitrator designated by the claimant or claimants, one arbitrator designated by the health care provider or providers against whom the claim is made, and a third arbitrator designated by mutual agreement who shall serve as chairperson of the board. If the parties cannot agree on the third person, the court will provide a choice of three or more persons who might serve as chairperson of the arbitration board, which shall be from a list of qualified arbitrators furnished by the attorney general. Claimant or claimants together and health care provider or providers together may each strike one or more names so that after each side has done so at least one name remains, providing a basis for the final selection by the court.

(g) The attorney general shall prepare a list of persons consisting of lawyers or other persons qualified to serve as chairperson of an arbitration board. They shall be selected on the basis of their technical expertise, judicial temperament, and capability of impartially acting on malpractice claims. The attorney general shall submit a list of at least three names whenever requested to do so by the court along with detailed biographical information on each person listed.

(h) Each member of the arbitration board shall receive reasonable compensation to be paid by the court based on the extent and duration of services rendered.  The court shall pay the costs of expert witnesses called by the board and the costs of expert witnesses called by the parties to the arbitration up to a maximum of three witnesses for each side and $150 per day for each expert witness.

(i) The arbitration board may appoint an expert advisory panel, with the powers of the expert advisory panel under AS 09.55.536, to advise the board on the medical facts of the case.

(j) The court shall specify the shortest practical deadline for completion of the work of the arbitration board, taking into account all the circumstances and the nature of the case.

(k) The provisions of AS 09.43.010§09.43.180 (Uniform Arbitration Act) or AS 09.43.300§09.43.595 (Revised Uniform Arbitration Act) apply as provided in AS 09.43.010 and 09.43.300 to arbitrations under this section if they do not conflict with the provisions of this section; arbitrations under this section shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by any rules of court that may be adopted and according to provisions of AS 09.55.540§09.55.548, 09.55.554§09.55.560, and AS 09.65.090.

###### Sec. 09.55.536.   Expert advisory panel.

(a) In an action for damages due to personal injury or death based upon the provision of professional services by a health care provider, including a person providing services on behalf of a governmental entity, when the parties have not agreed to arbitration of the claim under AS 09.55.535, the court shall appoint within 20 days after the filing of an answer to a summons and complaint a three-person expert advisory panel unless the court decides that an expert advisory opinion is not necessary for a decision in the case. When the action is filed, the court shall, by order, determine the professions or specialties to be represented on the expert advisory panel, giving the parties the opportunity to object or make suggestions.

(b) The expert advisory panel may compel the attendance of witnesses, interview the parties, physically examine the injured person if alive, consult with the specialists or learned works they consider appropriate, and compel the production of and examine all relevant hospital, medical, or other records or materials relating to the health care in issue.  The panel may meet in camera, but shall maintain a record of any testimony or oral statements of witnesses, and shall keep copies of all written statements it receives.

(c) Not more than 30 days after selection of the panel, the panel shall make a written report to the parties and to the court, answering the following questions and other questions submitted to the panel by the court in sufficient detail to explain the case and the reasons for the panel's answers:

(1) Why did the claimant seek medical care?

(2) Was a correct diagnosis made? If not, what was incorrect about the diagnosis?

(3) Was the treatment or lack of treatment appropriate? If not, what was inappropriate about the treatment or lack of treatment?

(4) Was the claimant injured during the course of evaluation or treatment or by failure to diagnose or treat?

(5) If the answer to question 4 is "yes," what is the nature and extent of the medical injury?

(6) What specifically caused the medical injury?

(7) Was the medical injury caused by unskillful care? Explain.

(8) If a medical injury had not occurred, what would have been the likely outcome of the medical case?

(d) In any case in which the answer to one or more of the questions submitted to the panel depends upon the resolution of factual questions that are not the proper subject of expert opinion, the report must so state and may answer questions based upon hypothetical facts that are fully set out in the opinion. The report must include copies of all written statements, opinions, or records relied upon by the panel and either a transcription or other record of any oral statements or opinions; must specify any medical or scientific authority relied upon by the panel; and must include the results of any physical or mental examination performed on the plaintiff. Each member shall sign the report and the signature constitutes the member's adoption of all statements and opinions contained in it; however, a member may, instead of signing the report, submit a concurring or dissenting report that complies with the requirements of this subsection.  A member may not attest to any portion of the report as to which the member is not qualified to give expert testimony.

(e) The report of the panel with any dissenting or concurring opinion is admissible in evidence to the same extent as though its contents were orally testified to by the person or persons preparing it. The court shall delete any portion that would not be admissible because of lack of foundation for opinion testimony, or otherwise.  Either party may submit testimony to support or refute the report.  The jury shall be instructed in general terms that the report shall be considered and evaluated in the same manner as any other expert testimony. Any member of the panel may be called by any party and may be cross-examined as to the contents of the report or of that member's dissenting or concurring opinion.

(f) Discovery may not be undertaken in a case until the report of the expert advisory panel is received or 60 days after selection of the panel, whichever occurs first. However, the court may relax this prohibition upon a showing of good cause by any party. If the panel has not completed its report within the 30-day period prescribed in (c) of this section, the court may, upon application, grant the panel an additional 30 days.

(g) Members of a panel are entitled to travel expenses and per diem in accordance with state law pertaining to members of boards and commissions for all time spent in preparing its report.  If a panel member is called upon as a witness at trial or upon deposition, the member is entitled to payment of an expert witness fee, which may not exceed $150 per day. All expenses incurred by the panel shall be paid by the court. However, in any case in which the court determines that a party has made a patently frivolous claim or a patently frivolous denial of liability, it shall order that all costs of the expert advisory panel be borne by the party making that claim or denial.

(h) Parties to the case and their counsel may not initiate communication out of court with members of the panel on the subject matter of its inquiry and report or cause or solicit others to do so, except through ordinary discovery proceedings.

(i) This section applies regardless of whether a party in the action or the health care provider whose professional services are the subject of the action is a governmental entity or in the public or private sector.

###### Sec. 09.55.540.   Burden of proof.

(a) In a malpractice action based on the negligence or wilful misconduct of a health care provider, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence

(1) that the plaintiff had a health care provider-patient relationship with the defendant at the time of the act complained of;

(2) the degree of knowledge or skill possessed or the degree of care ordinarily exercised under the circumstances, at the time of the act complained of, by health care providers in the field or specialty in which the defendant is practicing;

(3) that the defendant either lacked this degree of knowledge or skill or failed to exercise this degree of care; and

(4) that, as a proximate result of this lack of knowledge or skill or the failure to exercise this degree of care, the plaintiff suffered injuries that would not otherwise have been incurred.

(b) In malpractice actions there is no presumption of negligence on the part of the defendant.

(c) In this section, "health care provider-patient relationship" means a relationship between a health care provider and a patient formed for the purpose of the health care provider providing examination, diagnosis, or treatment to the patient.

###### Sec. 09.55.544.   Evidence.

(a) In a civil action or arbitration under AS 09.55.530§09.55.560, notwithstanding AS 09.43.050(2), 09.43.420(a), or 09.43.440(e), the following are not admissible as evidence:

(1) an expression of apology, sympathy, commiseration, compassion, or benevolence made orally, by conduct, or in writing by a health care provider or an employee of a health care provider to a patient, the patient's relative, or a legal representative of a patient concerning an unanticipated outcome of medical treatment or care regarding the patient's discomfort, pain, suffering, injury, or death;

(2) evidence of an offer made by a health care provider to a patient, the patient's relative, or a legal representative of a patient to correct or remediate an unanticipated outcome of medical treatment or care;

(3) evidence of conduct or statements by a health care provider to furnish, offer, accept, or promise to furnish or accept valuable consideration to compromise or attempt to compromise or settle a medical malpractice claim disputed as to validity or amount;

(4) evidence of furnishing, offering, or promising to pay medical, hospital, or similar expenses, in full or in part, by a health care provider following an unanticipated outcome of medical treatment or care;

(5) evidence of a health care provider requesting, demanding, inquiring, or directing another to write-off, offer, or promise to pay medical, hospital, or similar expenses, in whole or in part, following an unanticipated outcome of medical treatment or care.

(b) If an expression of apology, sympathy, commiseration, compassion, or benevolence made under (a)(1) of this section is made in conjunction with an admission of liability or negligence, only the expression of apology, sympathy, commiseration, compassion, or benevolence is inadmissible, and the admission of liability or negligence may be admissible as evidence.

(c) This section does not apply to an offer of judgment under AS 09.30.065.

(d) In this section,

(1) "legal representative" means a legal guardian, attorney, person designated to make decisions on behalf of a patient under a power of attorney, or patient's agent;

(A) the spouse of the patient;

(B) a parent, grandparent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandchild, brother, sister, half brother, or half sister of the patient;

(C) a parent of the patient's spouse; or

(D) an individual adopted by the patient.

###### Sec. 09.55.545.   Agreement to correct unanticipated outcome or settle claim; legal advice.

An agreement to correct an unanticipated outcome of medical treatment or care or to settle a claim of medical malpractice made between a health care provider and a patient or the patient's legal representative is voidable if the health care provider has not advised the patient or the patient's legal representative in writing that the patient or the patient's legal representative may seek legal advice.

###### Sec. 09.55.546.   Advance payments.

In an action to recover damages under AS 09.55.530§09.55.560, no advance payment made by the defendant health care provider or the professional liability insurer of the defendant to or on behalf of the plaintiff is admissible as evidence or may be construed as an admission of liability for injuries or damages suffered by the plaintiff; however, a final award in favor of the plaintiff shall be reduced to the extent of any advance payment.  The advance payment shall inure to the exclusive benefit of the defendant or the insurer making the payment.

###### Sec. 09.55.547.   Pleading of damages.

In a cause of action against a health care provider for malpractice, the complaint or any other pleadings may not contain an ad damnum clause or monetary amount claimed against the defendant health care provider, except as necessary for jurisdictional purposes.

###### Sec. 09.55.548.   Awards; collateral source.

(a) Damages shall be awarded in accordance with principles of the common law. The fact finder in a malpractice action shall render any award for damages by category of loss. The court may enter a judgment that future damages be paid in whole or in part by periodic payments rather than by a lump-sum payment; the judgment must include, if necessary, other provisions to assure that funds are available as periodic payments become due. Insurance from an authorized insurer as defined in AS 21.97.900 is sufficient assurance that funds will be available. Any part of the award that is paid on a periodic basis shall be adjusted annually according to changes in the consumer price index in the community where the claimant resides. In this subsection, "future damages" includes damages for future medical treatment, care or custody, loss of future earnings, or loss of bodily function of the claimant.

(b) Except when the collateral source is a federal program that by law must seek subrogation and except death benefits paid under life insurance, a claimant may only recover damages from the defendant that exceed amounts received by the claimant as compensation for the injuries from collateral sources, whether private, group, or governmental, and whether contributory or noncontributory. Evidence of collateral sources, other than a federal program that must by law seek subrogation and the death benefit paid under life insurance, is admissible after the fact finder has rendered an award. The court may take into account the value of claimant's rights to coverage exhausted or depleted by payment of these collateral benefits by adding back a reasonable estimate of their probable value, or by earmarking and holding for possible periodic payment under (a) of this section that amount of the award that would otherwise have been deducted, to see if the impairment of claimant's rights actually takes place in the future.

###### Sec. 09.55.549.   Limitation on damages from health care provider's services.

(a) Notwithstanding AS 09.17.010, noneconomic damages for personal injury or death based on the provision of services by a health care provider may only be awarded as provided in this section.

(b) In an action to recover damages for personal injury or wrongful death based on the provision of services by a health care provider, damages may include both economic and noneconomic damages.

(c) Damage claims for noneconomic losses shall be limited to compensation for pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of consortium, and other nonpecuniary damage, but may not include hedonic damages.

(d) Except as provided in (e) of this section, the damages awarded by a court or a jury under (c) of this section for all claims including a loss of consortium claim or other derivative claim arising out of a single injury may not exceed $250,000 regardless of the number of health care providers against whom the claim is asserted or the number of separate claims or causes of action brought with respect to the injury.

(e) The damages awarded by a court or jury under (c) of this section for all claims including a loss of consortium claim or other derivative claim arising out of a single injury or death may not exceed $400,000 regardless of the number of health care providers against whom the claim is asserted or the number of separate claims or causes of action brought with respect to the injury or death when damages are awarded for wrongful death or severe permanent physical impairment that is more than 70 percent disabling.

(f) The limitation on noneconomic damages in this section does not apply if the damages resulted from an act or omission that constitutes reckless or intentional misconduct.

(g) Multiple injuries sustained by one person as a result of a single course of treatment shall be treated as a single injury for purposes of this section.

(h) In this section,

(1) "economic damages" means objectively verifiable monetary losses incurred as a result of the provision of, use of, or payment for, or failure to provide, use, or pay for health care services or medical products, and includes past and future medical expenses, loss of past and future earnings, cost of obtaining domestic services, burial expenses, loss of use of property, cost of replacement or repair, loss of employment, and loss of business or employment opportunities;

(2) "health care provider" has the meaning given in AS 09.55.560 and includes a state agency or municipality the health care services of which are the subject of an action that is subject to this section;

(3) "hedonic damages" means damages that attempt to compensate for the pleasure of being alive.

###### Sec. 09.55.550.   Jury instructions.

In medical malpractice actions the jury shall be instructed that the plaintiff has the burden of proving the health care provider's negligence or wilful misconduct in accordance with the standard of proof specified in AS 09.55.540.  The jury shall be further instructed that injury alone does not raise a presumption of the health care provider's negligence or misconduct.

###### Sec. 09.55.554.   Immunity for oral contracts.

A cause of action against a health care provider does not arise for breach of an oral contract to provide a cure or achieve a specific medical result.

###### Sec. 09.55.556.   Informed consent.

(a) A health care provider is liable for failure to obtain the informed consent of a patient if the claimant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the provider has failed to inform the patient of the common risks and reasonable alternatives to the proposed treatment or procedure, and that but for that failure the claimant would not have consented to the proposed treatment or procedure.

(b) It is a defense to any action for medical malpractice based upon an alleged failure to obtain informed consent that

(1) the risk not disclosed is too commonly known or is too remote to require disclosure;

(2) the patient stated to the health care provider that the patient would undergo the treatment or procedure regardless of the risk involved or that the patient did not want to be informed of the matters to which the patient would be entitled to be informed;

(3) under the circumstances consent by or on behalf of the patient was not possible; or

(4) the health care provider after considering all of the attendant facts and circumstances used reasonable discretion as to the manner and extent that the alternatives or risks were disclosed to the patient because the health care provider reasonably believed that a full disclosure would have a substantially adverse effect on the patient's condition.

###### Sec. 09.55.560.   Definitions.

#### Article 7. Survival and Wrongful Death Actions.

###### Sec. 09.55.570.   All causes of action survive.

All causes of action by one person against another, whether arising on contract or otherwise, except those involving defamation of character, survive to the personal representatives of the former and against the personal representatives of the latter, but this may not be construed so as to abate an action for a wrong where any party has died after the verdict or to defeat or prejudice the right of action given by AS 09.15.010.  The personal representatives may maintain an action thereon against the party against whom the cause of action accrued, or, after the party's death, against the personal representatives of the party.

###### Sec. 09.55.580.   Action for wrongful death.

(a) Except as provided under (f) of this section and AS 09.65.145, when the death of a person is caused by the wrongful act or omission of another, the personal representatives of the former may maintain an action therefor against the latter, if the former might have maintained an action, had the person lived, against the latter for an injury done by the same act or omission. The action shall be commenced within two years after the death, and the damages therein shall be the damages the court or jury may consider fair and just.  The amount recovered, if any, shall be exclusively for the benefit of the decedent's spouse and children when the decedent is survived by a spouse or children, or other dependents.  When the decedent is survived by no spouse or children or other dependents, the amount recovered shall be administered as other personal property of the decedent but shall be limited to pecuniary loss.  When the plaintiff prevails, the trial court shall determine the allowable costs and expenses of the action and may, in its discretion, require notice and hearing thereon. The amount recovered shall be distributed only after payment of all costs and expenses of suit and debts and expenses of administration.

(3) loss of assistance or services irrespective of age or relationship of decedent to the beneficiary or beneficiaries;

(4) loss of consortium;

(5) loss of prospective training and education;

(6) medical and funeral expenses.

(d) The death of a beneficiary or beneficiaries before judgment does not affect the amount of damages recoverable under this section.

(e) The right of action granted by this section is not abated by the death of a person named or to be named the defendant.

(f) A person whose act or omission constitutes the felonious killing of another person may not recover damages for the death of that person either directly or as a personal representative of that person's estate. In this subsection, a "felonious killing" means a crime defined by AS 11.41.100§11.41.140.

#### Article 8. Removal of Disabilities of a Minor.

###### Sec. 09.55.590.   Removal of disabilities of minority.

(a) A minor who is a resident of this state and is at least 16 years of age, who is living separate and apart from the parents or guardian of the minor, capable of sustained self-support and of managing one's own financial affairs, or the legal custodian of such a minor, may petition the superior court to have the disabilities of minority removed for limited or general purposes.

(b) A minor or the legal custodian of a minor may institute a petition under this section in the name of the minor.

(c) The petition for removal of disabilities of minority must state

(1) the name, age, and residence address of the minor;

(2) the name and address of each living parent;

(3) the name and address of the guardian of the person and the guardian of the estate, if any;

(4) the reasons why removal would be in the best interest of the minor; and

(5) the purposes for which removal is sought.

(d) The person who institutes a petition under this section must obtain the consent of each living parent or guardian having control of the person or property of the minor. If the person who is to consent to the petition is unavailable or the whereabouts of that person are unknown, or if a parent or guardian unreasonably withholds consent, the court, acting in the best interest of the minor, may waive this requirement of consent as to that parent or guardian.

(e) The court may appoint an attorney or a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the minor at the hearing. Appointment of an attorney or guardian ad litem shall be made in accordance with AS 25.24.310.

(f) If the petition under this section is filed by a minor, the court may remove the disabilities of minority as requested in the petition if the court finds on the record after a hearing that the minor is a resident of the state, at least 16 years of age, living separate and apart from the parent or guardian of the minor, and capable of sustained self-support and managing the minor's own financial affairs. If the petition under this section is filed by the legal custodian of a minor, the court may remove the disabilities of minority as requested in the petition only if the minor consents on the record to the removal of disabilities and the court, in addition to making the other findings required under this subsection for a petition filed by a minor, makes a finding on the record that there is interpersonal conflict involving the legal custodian and the minor that the custodian and the minor have been unable to resolve satisfactorily through other means; the finding must include a description of the efforts that were made by the legal custodian to resolve the interpersonal conflict before the custodian filed the petition under this section. If the court determines that removal of disabilities is in the best interests of the minor, the court may waive the requirement for the minor's consent that is otherwise imposed under this subsection.

###### Sec. 09.60.010.   Costs and attorney fees allowed prevailing party.

(a) The supreme court shall determine by rule or order the costs, if any, that may be allowed a prevailing party in a civil action.  Unless specifically authorized by statute or by agreement between the parties, attorney fees may not be awarded to a party in a civil action for personal injury, death, or property damage related to or arising out of fault, as defined in AS 09.17.900, unless the civil action is contested without trial, or fully contested as determined by the court.

(b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, a court in this state may not discriminate in the award of attorney fees and costs to or against a party in a civil action or appeal based on the nature of the policy or interest advocated by the party, the number of persons affected by the outcome of the case, whether a governmental entity could be expected to bring or participate in the case, the extent of the party's economic incentive to bring the case, or any combination of these factors.

(c) In a civil action or appeal concerning the establishment, protection, or enforcement of a right under the United States Constitution or the Constitution of the State of Alaska, the court

(1) shall award, subject to (d) and (e) of this section, full reasonable attorney fees and costs to a claimant, who, as plaintiff, counterclaimant, cross claimant, or third-party plaintiff in the action or on appeal, has prevailed in asserting the right;

(2) may not order a claimant to pay the attorney fees of the opposing party devoted to claims concerning constitutional rights if the claimant as plaintiff, counterclaimant, cross claimant, or third-party plaintiff in the action or appeal did not prevail in asserting the right, the action or appeal asserting the right was not frivolous, and the claimant did not have sufficient economic incentive to bring the action or appeal regardless of the constitutional claims involved.

(d) In calculating an award of attorney fees and costs under (c)(1) of this section,

(1) the court shall include in the award only that portion of the services of claimant's attorney fees and associated costs that were devoted to claims concerning rights under the United States Constitution or the Constitution of the State of Alaska upon which the claimant ultimately prevailed; and

(2) the court shall make an award only if the claimant did not have sufficient economic incentive to bring the suit, regardless of the constitutional claims involved.

(e) The court, in its discretion, may abate, in full or in part, an award of attorney fees and costs otherwise payable under (c) and (d) of this section if the court finds, based upon sworn affidavits or testimony, that the full imposition of the award would inflict a substantial and undue hardship upon the party ordered to pay the fees and costs or, if the party is a public entity, upon the taxpaying constituents of the public entity.

###### Sec. 09.60.015.   Attorney fees in certain small claims actions.

(a) In any action for damages where the amount pleaded is $1,000 or less, and the plaintiff, when represented by counsel, prevails in the action, the plaintiff shall be allowed a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorney fees for the prosecution of the action as a part of the costs of the action if the court finds that written demand for the payment of the claim was made on the defendant 20 days or more before the commencement of the action. However, attorney fees may not be allowed to the plaintiff if the court finds that the defendant tendered to the plaintiff before the commencement of the action, an amount not less than the damages awarded to the plaintiff.

(b) If the defendant, when represented by counsel, pleads a counterclaim that does not exceed $1,000, and the defendant prevails in the action, the defendant shall be allowed a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorney fees for the prosecution of the counterclaim as part of the costs of the action.

In actions in which an executor, administrator, trustee of an express trust, or a person authorized to represent a party is a party, costs may be allowed as in other cases.

###### Sec. 09.60.050.   Costs awarded against state, borough, city, or other public agencies.

When the state or a borough, city, or other public agency or entity or an officer thereof in an official capacity is a party, costs shall be awarded against it on the same basis as against any other natural person or party.

When required, all proceedings in the action shall be stayed until an undertaking executed by one or more sufficient sureties is filed with the court to the effect that they will pay the costs and attorney fees which are awarded against the plaintiff, for not less than $200.  A new or an additional undertaking may be ordered by the court upon proof that the original undertaking is insufficient in amount or security.

(2) in an automated transaction involving an individual, the individual may avoid the effect of an electronic record that resulted from an error made by the individual in dealing with the electronic agent of another person if the electronic agent did not provide an opportunity for the prevention or correction of the error and, at the time the individual learns of the error, the individual

(1) if the sender or recipient has more than one place of business, the place of business of that person is the place having the closest relationship to the underlying transaction;

(2) if the sender or the recipient does not have a place of business, the place of business is the sender's or recipient's residence, as the case may be.

(e) An electronic record is received under (b) of this section even if no individual is aware of its receipt.

(f) Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system described in (b) of this section establishes that a record was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.
