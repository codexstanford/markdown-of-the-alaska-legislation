###### Sec. 30.05.010.   Subsidies to freight carriers.

###### Sec. 30.05.020.   Payment of subsidies.

The subsidy shall be paid in the installments the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities thinks proper, after proof is submitted that the conditions of the contract or subsidy are fulfilled up to the time of payment.  The inability to touch at a point along the route designated by the department due to a lack of proper docking or harbor facilities or to stress of weather does not prevent the owner or charterer from receiving the money otherwise earned, and is not a cause for reducing the amount of the subsidy.  If the subsidized vessel is lost, wrecked, or damaged, the department may permit the contractor to carry out the service temporarily with another vessel or ship of American registry that meets with its approval.

###### Sec. 30.05.030.   Tariff of rates.

The owner or charterer of the vessel awarded the subsidy must adopt and publish a tariff of freight rates to be approved by the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities.  The tariff must be reasonable, and the operator of the vessel may not charge more than provided for in the tariff.  The tariff must be published before services are performed under the subsidy.

###### Sec. 30.05.040.   Report by owner or charterer.

It is a condition in awarding of the subsidy that the contractor agrees to make a report under oath, in form and manner designated by the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities at the end of each year, giving the following information:

(1) tariff sheet of freight rates for the route covered;

(2) total tonnage carried;

(3) gross earning from freight and mail service rendered, segregating the two amounts;

(4) a statement in detail of all expenses incurred and on what account, the names and addresses of all persons employed, and the gross earnings and gross expense of the route covered.

## Chapter 07. Marine Radiotelephone Installation.

###### Sec. 30.07.010.   Radiotelephone installation requirements for vessels in excess of 200 gross tons.

In addition to applicable federal statutes and regulations, a person may not operate a vessel of any type in excess of 200 gross tons in the territorial waters of the state unless a licensed VHF radiotelephone installation equipped with at least five channels, including standard VHF calling and distress frequencies, or a standard marine radiotelephone equipped with at least five channels, including standard radiotelephone calling and distress frequencies, is installed and capable of being operated from the bridge or wheelhouse of the vessel. While the vessel is underway the radiotelephone shall be monitored at all times on the applicable standard calling and distress frequency by a person qualified to operate radio equipment of the type required by this section.

###### Sec. 30.07.020.   Regulations.

The Department of Transportation and Public Facilities may adopt regulations, not in conflict with federal law or regulations, that establish standards for marine communications in the state.

###### Sec. 30.07.030.   Penalties.

A master or owner of a vessel in operation that is in violation of this chapter, or a regulation adopted under it, is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction is punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.  Each day the violation continues constitutes a separate offense under this section.

This information may be contained in a preliminary prospectus, offering circular, or official statement relating to the bond issue.  Bonds may not be issued unless the state bond committee finds, based upon the information submitted by the authority under this subsection and other information that is reasonably available to it, that the project revenues can be reasonably expected to be adequate for payment of the principal and interest on the bonds to be issued if the bonds are to be secured by project revenues alone, and in any event that issuance of the bonds by the authority would not be expected to adversely affect the ability of the state or its political subdivisions to market bonds.

###### Sec. 30.13.080.   Validity of pledge.

It is the intention of the legislature that a pledge made in respect of bonds is perfected and valid and binding from the time the pledge is made; that the money or property so pledged and thereafter received by an authority is immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery or further act; and that the lien of the pledge is valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority whether or not the parties have notice.

The authority may not pledge the faith or credit of the state or of a political subdivision of the state, except the authority, to the payment of a bond, and the issuance of a bond by the authority does not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or a political subdivision of the state to apply money from, levy or pledge any form of taxation to the payment of the bond.

(c) An authority issuing bonds shall print the language in (b) of this section in substantial form on the face of the bonds and in any offering circular or statement issued in connection with the bonds.

The authority is authorized to include this pledge and agreement of the state, insofar as it refers to holders of bonds of the authority, in a contract with the holders, and insofar as it relates to a federal agency, in a contract with the federal agency.

###### Sec. 30.13.110.   Exemption from taxation.

The real and personal property of an authority and its assets, income, and receipts are declared to be the property of a political subdivision of the state and, together with any project financed under this chapter, are exempt from all taxes and special assessments of the state or a political subdivision of the state. All bonds of an authority are declared to be issued by a political subdivision of the state and for an essential public and governmental purpose and to be a public instrumentality, and the bonds, and the interest on them, the income from them and the transfer of the bonds, and all assets, income, and receipts pledged to pay or secure the payment of the bonds, or interest on them, shall at all times be exempt from taxation by or under the authority of the state, except for inheritance and estate taxes and taxes on transfers by or in contemplation of death. Nothing in this section affects or limits an exemption from license fees, property taxes, or excise, income, or other taxes, provided under any other law, nor does it create a tax exemption with respect to the interest of any business enterprise or other person, other than the authority, in any property, assets, income, receipts, project, or lease whether or not financed under this chapter.

###### Sec. 30.13.120.   Bonds as legal investments for fiduciaries.

###### Sec. 30.13.125.   Audit.

The legislative auditor shall audit or shall cause to have audited annually the financial records of an authority.  The legislative auditor may prescribe the form and content of the financial records of an authority and shall have access to these records at any reasonable time.

###### Sec. 30.13.130.   Equal use and access.

If an authority owns, leases, or otherwise operates or controls, or participates in the financing of, a facility, the authority shall, to the maximum extent possible, provide for equal rights of access to and use of the facility by members of the public and other persons or entities upon terms and conditions that are fair and reasonable. However, this section does not prevent an authority from establishing fair and reasonable limitations on use of or access to a facility to the extent the limitations are necessary in connection with the nature of the facility or the demand for use of or access to the facility.  This section applies to the establishment of rates and rate structures as well as all other factors, terms, and conditions relating to the use of or access to the facility, including without limitation the design and location of the facility.  The members of the authority shall make a written finding concerning compliance of the facility with the provisions of this section.  A written finding signed by at least three of the five elected members and two of the three appointed members that the facility complies with the provisions of this section shall constitute a conclusive presumption of compliance.

On integration the borough or home rule municipality succeeds to all the rights, powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of the authority, except that any indebtedness of an authority does not constitute a general obligation of the borough or home rule municipality payable from taxes levied by the borough or home rule municipality.
