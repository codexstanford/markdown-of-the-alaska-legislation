###### Sec. 15.05.020.   Rules for determining residence of voter.

For the purpose of determining residence for voting, the place of residence is governed by the following rules:

(1) A person may not be considered to have gained a residence solely by reason of presence nor may a person lose it solely by reason of absence while in the civil or military service of this state or of the United States or of absence because of marriage to a person engaged in the civil or military service of this state or the United States, while a student at an institution of learning, while in an institution or asylum at public expense, while confined in public prison, while engaged in the navigation of waters of this state or the United States or of the high seas, while residing upon an Indian or military reservation, or while residing in the Alaska Pioneers' Home or the Alaska Veterans' Home.

(2) The residence of a person is that place in which the person's habitation is fixed, and to which, whenever absent, the person has the intention to return. If a person resides in one place, but does business in another, the former is the person's place of residence. Temporary work sites do not constitute a dwelling place.

(3) A change of residence is made only by the act of removal joined with the intent to remain in another place. There can only be one residence.

(4) A person does not lose residence if the person leaves home and goes to another country, state, or place in this state for temporary purposes only and with the intent of returning.

(5) A person does not gain residence in any place to which the person comes without the present intention to establish a permanent dwelling at that place.

(6) A person loses residence in this state if the person votes in another state's election, either in person or by absentee ballot, and will not be eligible to vote in this state until again qualifying under AS 15.05.010.

(7) The term of residence is computed by including the day on which the person's residence begins and excluding the day of election.

(8) The address of a voter as it appears on the official voter registration record is presumptive evidence of the person's voting residence. This presumption is negated only if the voter notifies the director in writing of a change of voting residence.

###### Sec. 15.05.030.   Loss and restoration of voting rights.

(a) A person convicted of a crime that constitutes a felony involving moral turpitude under state or federal law may not vote in a state, federal, or municipal election from the date of the conviction through the date of the unconditional discharge of the person. Upon the unconditional discharge, the person may register under AS 15.07.

(b) The commissioner of corrections shall establish procedures by which a person unconditionally discharged is advised of the voter registration requirements and procedures.

(f) If an applicant who requests registration cannot comply with the requirement of (a)(2) of this section because the applicant has not been issued any of the listed numbers, the division shall assign the applicant a unique identifying number.

###### Sec. 15.07.064.   Information required for voter registration.

(a) A voter requesting registration or reregistration shall provide the director with sufficient information to determine

(1) the location of the residence of the voter within the district;

(2) the precinct in which the voter is qualified to vote;

(3) the other local or regional election jurisdictions in which the voter is eligible to vote.

(b) In determining the sufficiency of the registration information provided by the voter in an application to register, the director may consider

(1) whether the voter is applying in person, by mail from a location within the state, or by mail from a location outside the state;

(2) the location, size, or density of the population within the municipality, established village, or geographic area in which the voter claims residence;

(3) whether the municipality, established village, or geographic area has been divided into precincts or local or regional election subdivisions;

(4) whether specific locations within the municipality, established village, or geographic area have been identified by street name, subdivisions, or other commonly known official descriptions; or

(5) other circumstances considered significant by the director.

(c) A voter requesting registration in a municipality or established village that has been divided into more than one precinct or that includes more than one section of a local or regional election subdivision shall provide the director with information that describes the location of the residence of the voter.  In this subsection, the use of a post office box, a postal service center box, a rural route number, general delivery, or other description identified only as a mailing address does not establish the residence of the voter.  In addition to the name of the municipality or established village, the voter shall provide the director with information that describes a physical location that may be

(1) a street name, including a number on the street if one exists;

(2) a highway name and mile post number;

(3) a mobile home court and space number;

(4) a boat harbor and slip number;

(5) the name of a subdivision;

(6) the name of a building, institution, military or other reservation for which the location is fixed; or

(7) another descriptive phrase from which the specific physical location of the residence of the voter within the municipality or established village can be determined.

(d) The director is not required to request a voter who claims residence within a municipality or established village to provide the information required under (c) of this section if

(1) the municipality or established village is entirely within a single precinct; and

(2) a local or regional election subdivision is not divided into sections within the boundaries of the municipality or the area of the established village.

(e) The director shall review the information contained within an application by a voter for registration. The director may not reject an application of a voter who qualifies under (d) of this section because the voter provided information in excess of that required to establish qualifications, including excess information qualifying as a mailing address. The director may consider an application for registration within a municipality or established village described in (d) of this section to comply with law based on other information contained in the application, including evidence that

(1) the application was made in person before a voting registrar, election official, or absentee voting official appointed to serve in the municipality or established village;

(2) the application of a voter registering by mail was postmarked by the postal official in the municipality or established village; and

(3) other information contained in the application does not negate the presumption of residency provided under (a) of this section.

(f) A voter who resides in a building, institution, military or other reservation may establish residency for voting purposes by naming that place instead of naming a municipality or established village.  In this subsection the use of a post office box, a postal service center box, a rural route number, general delivery, or other description qualifying as a mailing address does not establish the residence of the voter.  The director is not required to request a voter who claims residence by naming the building, institution, military or other reservation to provide the information required under (c) of this section if

(1) the physical location of the place named in the application is fixed; and

(2) the place named in the application is contained within the boundaries of a single precinct.

(g) Notwithstanding (a)§(f) of this section, the director may substitute a mailing address provided by the voter for the permanent fund dividend program under AS 43.23 as the mailing address for the voter on the registration records of the director under procedures specified in regulations of the director if necessary to maintain accuracy of voting registration records.

(h) In this section, "established village" means an unincorporated community that is in

(1) the unorganized borough and that has 25 or more permanent residents; or

(2) an organized borough, has 25 or more permanent residents, and

(A) is on a road system and is located more than 50 miles outside the boundary limits of a unified municipality, or

(B) is not on a road system and is located more than 15 miles outside the boundary limits of a unified municipality.

When identifying information has been provided by the voter as required by this chapter, the election supervisor shall forward to the voter a registration card.

(c) The names of persons submitting completed registration forms by mail that are postmarked at least 30 days before the next election, or submitting completed registration forms by facsimile or other electronic transmission approved by the director under  AS 15.07.050 that are received at least 30 days before the next election, shall be placed on the official registration list for that election. If a registration form received by mail less than 30 days before an election does not have a legible and dated postmark, the name of the person submitting the form shall be placed on the official registration list for that election if the form was signed and dated by the person at least 30 days before the election and if the form is received by the director or election supervisor at least 25 days before the election. The name of a person submitting a completed registration form by mail or by facsimile or other electronic transmission that does not meet the applicable requirements of this subsection may not be placed on the official registration list for that election but shall be placed on the master register after that election.

(d) Qualified voters may register in person before a registration official or through a voter registration agency at any time throughout the year, except that a person registering within 30 days preceding an election is not eligible to vote at that election. Upon receipt and approval of the registration forms, the director or the election supervisor shall forward to the voter an acknowledgment in the form of a registration card, and the voter's name shall immediately be placed on the master register. Names of persons registering 30 or more days before an election shall be placed on the official registration list for that election.

A person who submitted an incomplete or inaccurate registration form may register by reexecuting and resubmitting a registration form in person, by mail, or by facsimile or other electronic transmission approved by the director under  AS 15.07.050. The requirements of (c) or (d) of this section apply to a registration form resubmitted under this subsection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an application made under  AS 43.23.015 that contains the information required by  AS 15.07.060(a)(1)§(4) and (7)§(9), and an attestation that such information is true, shall not be deemed an incomplete registration form and shall be accepted in accordance with  AS 15.07.070(i).

(g) The director shall provide voter registration forms prepared under (b) of this section to voter registration agencies designated under  AS 15.07.055 for distribution to the public.

(h) The director shall design the form of the voter's certificate appearing on the envelope that is used for voting an absentee in-person or questioned ballot so that all information required for registration by  AS 15.07.060(a) may be obtained from a voter who votes an absentee in-person or questioned ballot. If the voter voting an absentee in-person or questioned ballot has completed all information on the voter registration portion of the absentee in-person or questioned ballot voter's certificate, the director shall place the name of the voter on the official registration list.

(i)  The division shall register voters who submit an application to receive a permanent fund dividend in accordance with (j)§(m) of this section.

(j)  The division shall cooperate with the Department of Revenue under  AS 43.23.101 to ensure that the permanent fund dividend application form furnished by the Department of Revenue under  AS 43.23.015 allows an applicant, a person who is designated in a power of attorney to act on behalf of an applicant, or a person acting on behalf of a physically disabled applicant to submit voter registration information required under  AS 15.07.060(a)(1)§(4) and (7)§(9), and an attestation that such information is true. The director may require proof of identification of the applicant, if not already in the Department of Revenue's possession, as required by regulations adopted by the director under  AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act).

(k)  Upon receipt of the registration information, the director shall, as soon as practicable and in accordance with a schedule established by the director by rule, notify by United States mail and any other means authorized by the director, each applicant not already registered to vote at the address provided in the applicant's application

(1) of the processes to

(A) decline to be registered as a voter;

(B)  maintain an existing voter registration or be newly registered at a valid place of residence not provided in the applicant's application; and

(C)  adopt a political party affiliation; and

(2)  that failure to respond to the notification shall constitute the applicant's consent to cancel any registration to vote in another jurisdiction.

(l)  If an applicant does not decline to be registered as a voter within 30 calendar days after the director issues the notification, the application under  AS 43.23.015 will constitute a completed registration form. The name of the applicant shall be placed on the master register if the director determines that the person is qualified to vote under  AS 15.05.010, and the director shall forward to the applicant a registration card. If registration is denied, the applicant shall immediately be informed in writing that registration was denied and the reason for denial.

(m)  Any person who is not eligible to vote and who becomes registered under this provision through human or mechanical error shall not be found on that basis to have had the intent to unlawfully register to vote.

###### Sec. 15.07.075.   Voters unaffiliated with a political party.

(d) A person who claims to be a registered voter, but for whom no evidence of registration in the precinct can be found, shall be granted the right to vote in the same manner as that of a questioned voter and the ballot shall be treated in the same manner.

The director shall prepare all official ballots to facilitate fairness, simplicity, and clarity in the voting procedure, to reflect most accurately the intent of the voter, and to expedite the administration of elections. The following directives shall be followed when applicable:

(1) The director shall determine the size of the ballot, the type of print, necessary additional instruction notes to voters, and other similar matters of form not provided by law.

(5) The names of the candidates shall be placed in separate sections on the state general election ballot under the office designation to which they were nominated. If a candidate is registered as affiliated with a political party or political group, the party affiliation, if any, may be designated after the name of the candidate, upon request of the candidate. If a candidate has requested designation as nonpartisan or undeclared, that designation shall be placed after the name of the candidate. If a candidate is not registered as affiliated with a political party or political group and has not requested to be designated as nonpartisan or undeclared, the candidate shall be designated as undeclared. The lieutenant governor and the governor shall be included under the same section. Provision shall be made for voting for write-in candidates within each section. Paper ballots for the state general election shall be printed on white paper.

(6) The names of the candidates for each office shall be set out in the same order on ballots printed for use in each house district. The director shall randomly determine the order of the names of the candidates for state representative for each house district. The director shall rotate the order of placement of the names of candidates for governor, lieutenant governor, United States senator, United States representative, and state senator on the ballot for each house district.

(8) The general or special election ballot shall be designed with the title and proposition for any initiative, referendum, or constitutional amendment formulated as prescribed by law and placed on the ballot in the manner prescribed by the director. When placed on the ballot, a state ballot proposition or ballot question shall carry the number that was assigned to the petition for the proposition or question. Provision shall be made for marking the proposition "Yes" or "No."

(9) The general or special election ballot shall be designed with the question of whether a constitutional convention shall be called placed on the ballot in the following manner: "Shall there be a constitutional convention?" Provision shall be made for marking the question "Yes" or "No."

Unless specifically provided otherwise in the Act authorizing the debt, the ballot title shall, by the use of a few words in a succinct manner, indicate the general subject of the Act. The question shall, by the use of a few sentences in a succinct manner, give a true and impartial summary of the Act authorizing the state debt. The question of whether state debt shall be contracted shall be assigned a letter of the alphabet on the ballot. Provision shall be made for marking the question substantially as follows:

"Bonds....... Yes" or "Bonds....... No,"

followed by an appropriate oval.

(12) The director may provide for the optical scanning of ballots where the requisite equipment is available.

(13) The director may provide for voting by use of electronically generated ballots by a voter who requests to use a machine that produces electronically generated ballots.

(14) The director shall include the following statement on the ballot:

A candidate's designated affiliation does not imply that the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the political party or group or that the party or group approves of or associates with that candidate, but only that the candidate is registered as affiliated with the political party or political group.

(15) Instead of the statement provided by (14) of this section, when candidates for President and Vice-President of the United States appear on a general election ballot, the director shall include the following statement on the ballot:

A candidate's designated affiliation does not imply that the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the political party or political group or that the political party or political group approves of or associates with that candidate, but only that the candidate is registered as affiliated with the party or group. The election for President and Vice-President of the United States is different. Some candidates for President and Vice-President are the official nominees of their political party.

(16) The director shall design the general election ballots so that the candidates are selected by ranked-choice voting.

(17) The director shall design the general election ballot to direct the voter to mark candidates in order of preference and to mark as many choices as the voter wishes, but not to assign the same ranking to more than one candidate for the same office.

The board shall count the number of questioned ballots and compare that number to the number of questioned voters in the register.

The election board, in hand-count precincts, shall count the ballots in a manner that allows watchers to see the ballots when opened and read. A person handling the ballot after it has been taken from the ballot box and before it is placed in the envelope for mailing may not have a marking device in hand or remove a ballot from the immediate vicinity of the polls.

(b) Ballots may not be counted before 8:00 p.m., local time, on the day of the election.

(c) All general elections shall be conducted by ranked-choice voting.

(d) When counting ballots in a general election, the election board shall initially tabulate each validly cast ballot as one vote for the highest-ranked continuing candidate on that ballot or as an inactive ballot. If a candidate is highest-ranked on more than one-half of the active ballots, that candidate is elected and the tabulation is complete. Otherwise, tabulation proceeds in sequential rounds as follows:

(1) if two or fewer continuing candidates remain, the candidate with the greatest number of votes is elected and the tabulation is complete; otherwise, the tabulation continues under (2) of this subsection;

(2) if the candidate with the fewest votes is defeated, votes cast for the defeated candidate shall cease counting for the defeated candidate and shall be added to the totals of each ballot's next-highest-ranked continuing candidate or considered an inactive ballot under (g)(2) of this section, and a new round begins under (1) of this subsection.

(e) When counting general election ballots,

(1) a ballot containing an overvote shall be considered an inactive ballot once the overvote is encountered at the highest ranking for a continuing candidate;

(2) if a ballot skips a ranking, then the election board shall count the next ranking. If the next ranking is another skipped ranking, the ballot shall be considered an inactive ballot once the second skipped ranking is encountered; and

(3) in the event of a tie between the final two continuing candidates, the procedures in AS 15.15.460 and AS 15.20.430§15.20.530 shall apply to determine the winner of the general election; in the event of a tie between two candidates with the fewest votes, the tie shall be resolved by lot to determine which candidate is defeated.

(f) The election board may not count an inactive ballot for any candidate.

(g) In this section,

(1) "continuing candidate" means a candidate who has not been defeated;

(2) "inactive ballot" means a ballot that is no longer tabulated, either in whole or in part, by the division because it does not rank any continuing candidate, contains an overvote at the highest continuing ranking, or contains two or more sequential skipped rankings before its highest continuing ranking;

(3) "overvote" means an instance where a voter has assigned the same ranking to more than one candidate;

(4) "ranking" or "ranked" means the number assigned by a voter to a candidate to express the voter's choice for that candidate; a ranking of "1" is the highest ranking, followed by "2," and then "3," and so on;

(5) "round" means an instance of the sequence of voting tabulation in a general election;

(6) "skipped ranking" means a blank ranking on a ballot on which a voter has ranked another candidate at a subsequent ranking.

###### Sec. 15.15.360.   Rules for counting ballots.

(a) The election board shall count ballots according to the following rules:

(1) A voter may mark a ballot only by filling in, making "X" marks, diagonal, horizontal, or vertical marks, solid marks, stars, circles, asterisks, checks, or plus signs that are clearly spaced in the oval opposite the name of the candidate, proposition, or question that the voter desires to designate. In a general election, a voter may mark a ballot that requires the voter to vote for candidates in order of ranked preference by the use of numerals that are clearly spaced in one of the ovals opposite the name of the candidate that the voter desires to designate.

(2) A failure to properly mark a ballot as to one or more candidates does not itself invalidate the entire ballot.

(3) If a voter marks more names than there are persons to be elected to the office, the votes for candidates for that office may not be counted.

(4) The mark specified in (1) of this subsection shall be counted only if it is substantially inside the oval provided, or touching the oval so as to indicate clearly that the voter intended the particular oval to be designated.

(5) Improper marks on the ballot may not be counted and do not invalidate marks for candidates properly made.

(6) An erasure or correction invalidates only that section of the ballot in which it appears.

(7) A vote marked for the candidate for President or Vice-President of the United States is considered and counted as a vote for the election of the presidential electors.

(c)  [Repealed,§24 ch 113 SLA 2003.]

(d) Write-in votes shall be counted according to the following rules:

(2) in order to vote for a write-in candidate, the voter must write in the candidate's name in the space provided and fill in the oval opposite the candidate's name in accordance with (a)(1) of this section;

(3) a vote for a write-in candidate, other than a write-in vote for governor and lieutenant governor, shall be counted if the oval is filled in for that candidate and if the name of the candidate, as it appears on the write-in declaration of candidacy, or the last name of the candidate is written in the space provided;

(4) if the write-in vote is for governor and lieutenant governor, the vote shall be counted if the oval is filled in and the names of the candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, as they appear on the write-in declaration of candidacy, or the last names of the candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, or the name of the candidate for governor, as it appears on the write-in declaration of candidacy, or the last name of the candidate for governor is written in the space provided;

(5) in counting votes for a write-in candidate, the director shall disregard any abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor variation in the form of the name of a candidate if the intention of the voter can be ascertained.

(1) the highest number of votes received by any candidate for the office; or

(2) the second highest number of votes received by any candidate and the difference between the total number of votes received by the candidate having the highest number of votes and the aggregate of all votes cast for all write-in candidates for the office is less than the percentage necessary for a recount at the state's cost under AS 15.20.450.

(b) Write-in votes that do not meet the requirements of this section may not be individually counted under this section.

(c) If the director determines that the requirements of (a) of this section have been met, the director shall establish the date for counting those write-in votes, and the director, or a designee of the director, shall count all write-in ballots under AS 15.15.360(d).

The election board shall, immediately upon completion of the certificate or as soon thereafter as the local mail service permits, send in one sealed package to the director one copy of the certificate and the register. In addition, all ballots properly cast shall be mailed to the director in a separate, sealed package. Both packages, in addition to an address on the outside, shall clearly indicate the precinct from which they come. Each board shall, immediately upon completion of the certification and as soon thereafter as the local mail service permits, send the duplicate certificate to the respective election supervisor. The director may authorize election boards in precincts in those areas of the state where distance and weather make mail communication unreliable to forward their election results by telephone or radio. The director may authorize the unofficial totaling of votes on a regional basis by election supervisors, tallying the votes as indicated on duplicate certificates. To ensure adequate protection, the director shall prescribe the manner in which the ballots, registers, and all other election records and materials are thereafter preserved, transferred, and destroyed.

Another individual may apply for an absentee ballot on behalf of a qualified voter if that individual is designated to act on behalf of the voter in a written general power of attorney or a written special power of attorney that authorizes the other individual to apply for an absentee ballot on behalf of the voter. The application must include the address or, if the application requests delivery of an absentee ballot by electronic transmission, the telephone electronic transmission number, to which the absentee ballot is to be returned, the applicant's full Alaska residence address, and the applicant's signature. However, a person residing outside the United States and applying to vote absentee in federal elections in accordance with AS 15.05.011 need not include an Alaska residence address in the application.

The application must be made on a form prescribed or approved by the director. The voter or registration official shall submit the application directly to the division of elections. For purposes of this subsection, "directly to the division of elections" means that an application may not be submitted to any intermediary that could control or delay the submission of the application to the division or gather data on the applicant from the application form. However, nothing in this subsection is intended to prohibit a voter from giving a completed absentee ballot application to a friend, relative, or associate for transfer to the United States Postal Service or a private commercial delivery service for delivery to the division.

(b) An application requesting delivery of an absentee ballot to the applicant by mail must be received by the division of elections not less than 10 days before the election for which the absentee ballot is sought. An application for an absentee ballot for a state election from a qualified voter requesting delivery of an absentee ballot to the applicant by electronic transmission must be received by the division of elections not later than 5:00 p.m. Alaska time on the day before the election for which the absentee ballot is sought. An absentee ballot application submitted by mail under this section must permit the person to register to vote under AS 15.07.070 and to request an absentee ballot for each state election held within that calendar year for which the voter is eligible to vote. An absentee ballot application submitted by electronic transmission under this section may not include a provision that permits a person to register to vote under AS 15.07.070.

(c) After receipt of an application, the director shall send the absentee ballot and other absentee voting material to the applicant by the most expeditious mail service. However, if the application requests that an absentee ballot for a state election be sent by electronic transmission, the director shall send the absentee ballot and other absentee voting material to the applicant by electronic transmission. Except as provided in (k) of this section, the absentee ballot and other absentee voting material shall be sent as soon as they are ready for distribution. If the absentee ballot and other absentee voting material are mailed to the applicant, the return envelope sent with the ballot and other materials shall be addressed to the election supervisor in the district in which the voter is a resident.

If none of the officials listed in this subsection is reasonably accessible, an absentee voter shall sign the voter's certificate in the presence of an individual who is 18 years of age or older, who shall sign as a witness and attest to the date on which the voter signed the certificate in the individual's presence, and, in addition, the voter shall certify, as prescribed in AS 09.63.020, under penalty of perjury, that the statements in the voter's certification are true.

(e) An absentee ballot must be marked on or before the date of the election. Except as provided in (h) of this section, a voter who returns the absentee ballot by mail, whether provided to the voter by mail or by electronic transmission, shall use a mail service at least equal to first class and mail the ballot not later than the day of the election to the election supervisor for the house district in which the voter seeks to vote. Except as provided in AS 15.20.480, the ballot may not be counted unless it is received by the close of business on the 10th day after the election. If the ballot is postmarked, it must be postmarked on or before election day. After the day of the election, ballots may not be accepted unless received by mail.

(f) The director shall require a voter casting an absentee ballot by mail to provide proof of identification or other information to aid in the establishment of the voter's identity as prescribed by regulations adopted under AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act). If the voter is a first-time voter who initially registered by mail or by facsimile or other electronic transmission approved by the director under AS 15.07.050 and has not met the identification requirements set out in AS 15.07.060, the voter must provide one of the following forms of proof of identification:

(g) The director shall maintain a record of the name of each voter to whom an absentee ballot is sent under this section. The record must list the date on which the ballot is mailed or provided by electronic transmission and the date on which the ballot is received by the election supervisor and the dates on which the ballot was executed and postmarked.

(h) Except as provided in AS 15.20.480, an absentee ballot returned by mail from outside the United States or from an overseas voter qualifying under AS 15.05.011 that has been marked and mailed not later than election day may not be counted unless the ballot is received by the election supervisor not later than the close of business on the

(1) 10th day following a primary election or special primary election under AS 15.40.140; or

(2) 15th day following a general election or special election, other than a special primary election described in (1) of this subsection.

(i) [Repealed,§44 ch 73 SLA 2013.]

(j) The director shall adopt regulations under AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) specifying the information required to be included on an absentee ballot application form. The regulations must require that an absentee ballot application form

(2) conceal the personal information of the individual requesting delivery of an absentee ballot while the application is in the custody of the United States Postal Service or other person delivering the application to the division;

(3) specify that the form is to be returned by the voter directly to the division, and not to another person providing the form; and

The pamphlet shall be prepared on a regional basis as determined by the lieutenant governor.

###### Sec. 15.58.020.   Contents of pamphlet.

(13) the following statement written in bold in a conspicuous location:

Each candidate may designate the political party or political group that the candidate is registered as affiliated with. A candidate's political party or political group designation on a ballot does not imply that the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party or political group or that the party or group approves of or associates with that candidate.

In each race, you may vote for any candidate listed. If a primary election was held for a state office, United States senator, or United States representative, the four candidates who received the most votes for the office in the primary election advanced to the general election. However, if one of the four candidates who received the most votes for an office at the primary election died, withdrew, resigned, was disqualified, or was certified as incapacitated 64 days or more before the general election, the candidate who received the fifth most votes for the office advanced to the general election.

At the general election, each candidate will be selected through a ranked-choice voting process and the candidate with the greatest number of votes will be elected. For a general election, you must rank the candidates in the numerical order of your preference, ranking as many candidates as you wish. Your second, third, and subsequent ranked choices will be counted only if the candidate you ranked first does not receive enough votes to continue on to the next round of counting, so ranking a second, third, or subsequent choice will not hurt your first-choice candidate. Your ballot will be counted regardless of whether you choose to rank one, two, or more candidates for each office, but it will not be counted if you assign the same ranking to more than one candidate for the same office.

(b) Each primary, special, or special primary election pamphlet shall contain only the information specified in (a)(6) and (a)(9) of this section for each ballot measure scheduled to appear on the primary, special, or special primary election ballot.

(c) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, if a pamphlet is prepared and published under AS 15.58.010 for a

(1) primary election, the pamphlet must contain the following statement written in bold in a conspicuous location, instead of the statement provided by (a)(13) of this section:

In each race, you may vote for any candidate listed. The four candidates who receive the most votes for a state office, United States senator, or United States representative will advance to the general election. However, if, after the primary election and 64 days or more before the general election, one of the four candidates who received the most votes for an office at the primary election dies, withdraws, resigns, is disqualified, or is certified as incapacitated, the candidate who received the fifth most votes for the office will advance to the general election.

Each candidate may designate the political party or political group that the candidate is registered as affiliated with. A candidate's political party or political group designation on a ballot does not imply that the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party or group or that the party or group approves of or associates with that candidate;

(2) special primary election, the pamphlet must contain the following statement written in bold in a conspicuous location, instead of the statement provided by (a)(13) of this section:

In each race, you may vote for any candidate listed. The four candidates who receive the most votes for a state office or United States senator will advance to the special election. However, if, after the special primary election and 64 days or more before the special election, one of the four candidates who received the most votes for a state office or United States senator at the primary election dies, withdraws, resigns, is disqualified, or is certified as incapacitated, the candidate who received the fifth most votes for the office will advance to the general election. Each candidate may designate the political party or political group that the candidate is registered as affiliated with. A candidate's political party or political group designation on a ballot does not imply that the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party or group or that the party or group approves of or associates with that candidate.
