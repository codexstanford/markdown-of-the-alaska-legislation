###### Sec. 39.05.070.   Purpose of AS 39.05.070ยง39.05.200.

It is the purpose of AS 39.05.070ยง39.05.200 to provide procedural uniformity in the exercise of appointive powers conferred by the legislature to eliminate, insofar as possible, recess or interim appointments except in the event of death, resignation, inability to act, or other removal from office and the exercise, insofar as possible, of appointive powers only when the legislature is in session.

###### Sec. 39.05.080.   Procedure for all appointments.

Except as otherwise provided in a law relating to the positions or memberships on a specific board or commission, appointment to a position or membership shall be made in the following manner:

(1) Each governor shall present to the legislature the names of the persons appointed by that governor; each governor may present the name of a person appointed by a previous governor; only presentment that occurs during the time that the legislature is in regular session constitutes presentment under this section. The governor shall, within the first 15 days after the legislature convenes in regular session, present to the legislature for confirmation the names of the following persons: (A) persons appointed to a position or membership who have not previously been confirmed by the legislature, and (B) persons to be appointed to fill a position or membership the term of which will expire on or before March 1 during that session of the legislature. If an appointment is made after the first 15 days after the convening of the regular session but while the legislature is in regular session, the governor shall immediately present to the legislature for confirmation the name of the person appointed.

(2) When appointments are presented to the legislature for confirmation,

(A) the presiding officer of each house shall assign the name of each appointee to a standing committee of that house for a hearing, report, and recommendation; standing committees of the two houses assigned the same person's name for consideration may meet jointly to consider the qualifications of the person appointed and may issue either a separate or a joint report and recommendation concerning that person; then

(B) the legislature shall, before the end of the regular session in which the appointments are presented, in joint session assembled, act on the appointments by confirming or declining to confirm by a majority vote of all of the members the appointments presented.

(3) When the legislature declines to confirm an appointment, the legislature shall notify the governor of its action and a vacancy in the position or membership exists which the governor shall fill by making a new appointment. The governor may not appoint again the same person whose confirmation was refused for the same position or membership during the regular session of the legislature at which confirmation was refused. The person whose name is refused for appointment by the legislature may not thereafter be appointed to the same position or membership during the interim between regular legislative sessions. Failure of the legislature to act to confirm or decline to confirm an appointment during the regular session in which the appointment was presented is tantamount to a declination of confirmation on the day the regular session adjourns.

(4) Pending confirmation or rejection of appointment by the legislature, persons appointed shall exercise the functions, have the powers, and be charged with the duties prescribed by law for the appointive positions or membership. However, the duration of an appointment made during the time period between regular sessions of the legislature by a person who is not still the governor on the first day of the next regular session ends on the date during the next regular session that the sitting governor presents for confirmation an appointment to the office. For the purpose of applying laws that limit the number of terms or parts of terms that may be served by a member of a board or commission, the part of the term of office that is served under an interim appointment immediately before the member is reappointed under this paragraph is considered to be merged with the part of the term of office that is served immediately after reappointment so that the two periods of service constitute only one part of a term. The duration of an appointment made during a regular session of the legislature and not presented to the legislature by the governor during that session ends no later than the last day of that session. The duration of an appointment made during an interim by a governor who is not in office at the beginning of the next regular session of the legislature ends no later than the last day of that regular session unless the governor who is in office during that session presents the person's name for confirmation. The same governor may not appoint the same person to the same position or membership if the person's appointment ends because of the governor's failure to present the person's name for confirmation.

###### Sec. 39.05.090.   Time limits in AS 39.05.080.

The time limitations concerning the submission and resubmission of names as prescribed in AS 39.05.080 do not apply to those appointments that by law require recommendations by professional groups.

###### Sec. 39.05.100.   Qualifications for appointment.

(a) A person appointed to a board or commission of the state government shall be and have been before the last general election, (1) a registered voter in the state, if the appointment is made at large or (2) a registered voter from the judicial district, if the appointment is made from a specific judicial district. The student member of the Board of Regents of the University of Alaska appointed under AS 14.40.150(b), the student member of the Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education appointed under AS 14.42.015(d), and a member of the Alaska Human Relations Commission appointed under AS 44.19.600, are exempt from the requirement of this subsection if the member was not old enough to be a registered voter in the last general election.

(b) A member of a board or commission of the state government who ceases to reside in the state during the member's term terminates membership on the board or commission.  For the purposes of this section, the acceptance of employment outside the state for a six-month period or longer, or physical absence from the state for one year or longer, or registration as a voter in a municipal, county, district, state, or national election in a voting precinct outside the state is considered as discontinuing residence in the state.

###### Sec. 39.15.040.   Recovery on defective bond.

If a bond does not contain the matter or condition required by law, or there is a defect in the approval or filing of the bond, the bond is not void and the obligor and the obligor's sureties are bound to the state or party interested, and the state or party may, by action instituted in any court of competent jurisdiction, suggest the defect and recover a proper and equitable demand from the obligor and surety.

###### Sec. 39.15.050.   Procedure when bond becomes insufficient.

(a) If a surety on the bond dies, removes from the state, becomes insolvent or insufficient, or the penalty of the bond becomes insufficient, the Department of Administration shall, on its own motion or on the showing of a person supported by an affidavit, summon the officer or employee to appear before it at a stated time, not less than 15 days after service of the summons, and show cause why the officer or employee should not execute a new bond with good and sufficient sureties.

(b) If the officer or employee after notice fails to appear at the time appointed, the department shall hear and determine the matter in the absence of the officer or employee. If the department is of the opinion that the bond is insufficient, it shall require a new bond with sureties and in the amount considered necessary.

(c) The new bond shall be executed and filed within the time the department orders.  If the officer or employee fails to execute and file a new bond within the time prescribed, the office or appointment of the officer or employee becomes vacant as provided by AS 39.15.100.

A department or agency head may require a doctor's certificate showing the disability if the absence exceeds three consecutive working days;

(3) a medical condition of an officer or employee that makes presence at work a danger to the health of fellow employees is a medical reason for taking personal leave.  A department or agency head may require a doctor's certificate showing the condition if the absence exceeds three consecutive working days;

(4) pregnancy and childbirth or the placement of a child, other than the employee's stepchild, with the employee for adoption is a medical reason for an officer or employee to take personal leave;

(5) death of a member of an officer's or employee's immediate family is a medical reason for taking personal leave. No more than five days of personal leave may be taken for this purpose.

(b) The retirement plan established by AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680 is intended to qualify under 26 U.S.C. 401(a) and 414(d) (Internal Revenue Code) as a qualified retirement plan established and maintained by the state for its employees and for the employees of political subdivisions, public corporations, and public organizations of the state, and for the employees of other employers whose participation is authorized by AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680 and who participate in this plan.

(c) An amendment to AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680 does not provide a person with a vested right to a benefit if the Internal Revenue Service determines that the amendment will result in disqualification of the plan under the Internal Revenue Code.

(3) an employee of the university who participates in a university retirement program under AS 14.40.661ยง14.40.799.

###### Sec. 39.35.125.   Participation of elected officials.

(a) An elected official of the state or of a political subdivision of the state if the political subdivision has elected under AS 39.35.600ยง39.35.650 to designate elected officials in the classifications of employees entitled to participate in the plan is included in the plan unless the official files a written waiver of coverage with the administrator. A waiver under this subsection waives coverage of future employment as an elected official, regardless of any change of employer. An elected official may file a waiver under this subsection at any time after election to office, including the period before taking the oath of office. An elected official may revoke a waiver under this subsection by filing a written revocation with the administrator. A revocation under this subsection operates prospectively only, and the elected official may not receive credited service for service as an elected official while the waiver was in effect. There is no limit on the number of times an elected official may file a waiver or revocation under this subsection.

(b) Service as an elected official before January 1, 1981, with an employer may be included retroactively as credited service with the plan if the elected official or former elected official makes retroactive contributions equal to what the official would have made if the elected official or former elected official had been included in the plan when the oath of office as an elected official was taken, plus accrued interest from July 1, 1984. The rate used to calculate the retroactive contributions may not be less than the rate in effect on January 1, 1961. An elected official or former elected official may not receive credited service under this subsection for any period in which the elected official or former elected official was receiving a retirement benefit from the plan. An elected official or former elected official receiving a retirement benefit from the plan on January 1, 1981, is not eligible to claim credited service under this subsection unless the elected official or former elected official is reemployed as an active member. Service as an elected official with an employer constitutes employment as an active member as long as a waiver of coverage under (a) of this section is not in effect.

(c) An elected official included in the plan and that person's employer are liable for contributions whenever that person is an elected official unless a waiver of coverage under (a) of this section is in effect.

###### Sec. 39.35.131.   Membership in teachers' and public employees' retirement systems.

(a) A person who is employed at least half-time in the plan during the same period that the person is employed at least half-time in a position in the teachers' retirement plan under AS 14.25.009ยง14.25.220 shall receive credited service under each plan for half-time employment. However, the amount of credited service a person receives under the plan during a school year may not exceed the amount necessary, when added to the amount of credited service earned during the school year under the teachers' retirement plan, to equal one year of credited service.

(b) A person who was employed at least half-time in a position in the teachers' retirement plan under AS 14.25.009ยง14.25.220 in the same period that the person was employed at least half-time in a position in this plan may claim credited service in both plans for employment before May 31, 1989. To obtain this credited service, the person shall claim the service and verify the period of half-time employment. When eligibility for half-time service credit has been established, an indebtedness shall be determined to the retirement plan in which the person did not participate. The amount of the indebtedness is the full actuarial cost of providing benefits for the credited service claimed. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on that indebtedness beginning on the later of July 1, 1989, or the date on which the member is first eligible to claim the service. Any outstanding indebtedness existing at the time the person retires will require an actuarial adjustment to the benefits payable based on that service.

###### Sec. 39.35.150.   Re-employment of retired employees.

(a) If a retired employee subsequently becomes an active member, benefit payments may not be made during the period of re-employment.  During the period of re-employment, deductions from the employee's salary shall be made in accordance with AS 39.35.160.  Upon subsequent retirement, the retired employee is entitled to receive an additional pension based on the credited service and the average monthly compensation earned during the period of re-employment in accordance with AS 39.35.370.

(b) [Repealed byยง12 ch 57 SLA 2001, as amended byยง6 ch 15 SLA 2003 andยง10 ch 50 SLA 2005, effective July 1, 2009.]

(d) If the initial benefit payments to which the retired member is eligible have been reduced because the member retired early under AS 39.35.370(b) or increased because the member elected to receive a level income option benefit under former AS 39.35.460, the member shall also receive an incremental benefit based on the amount of the reduction imposed by AS 39.35.370(b) or the increase under former AS 39.35.460 on the first benefit and the length of time that the employee was reemployed and not receiving retirement benefits. The amount of the incremental benefit is equal to the difference between the normal retirement benefit to which the member would have been entitled had the member taken a normal retirement and the early retirement benefit or benefit under the level income option that the member has been receiving based on the member's initial period of employment multiplied by the total number of months that the member did not receive retirement benefits because of reemployment and that amount actuarially adjusted to be paid over the expected lifetime of the member. In the case of a member who selected benefits under the level income option, the total number of months may not include any month in which the member was 65 years of age or older.

(e) A member who retired under AS 39.35.370(a) and participated in a retirement incentive program under ch. 26, SLA 1986; ch. 89, SLA 1989; ch. 65, SLA 1996; ch. 4, FSSLA 1996; or ch. 92, SLA 1997, who is subsequently reemployed as a commissioner may become an active member without losing the incentive credit provided under the applicable retirement incentive plan and is not subject to any related reemployment indebtedness.

The amount of the surcharge is the difference between the amount the employer would have had to contribute under AS 39.35.255ยง39.35.290 for the employee when treating the employee's credited service as service earned under AS 39.35.300(c) or 39.35.310(c) less the amount the employer would have had to contribute under AS 39.35.255ยง39.35.290 without treating the employee's credited service as service earned under AS 39.35.300(c) or 39.35.310(c).

A rollover contribution as described in this subsection shall also be treated as employer contributions for the purpose of determining tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code and may be made by any one or a combination of the following methods:

###### Sec. 39.35.255.   Contributions by employers.

(a) Each employer, except as provided in (h) of this section, shall contribute to the system every payroll period an amount calculated by applying a rate of 22 percent of the greater of the total of all base salaries

(1) paid by the employer to employees who are active members of the system, including any adjustments to contributions required by AS 39.35.520; or

(2) paid by the employer to employees who were active members of the system during the corresponding payroll period for the fiscal year ending

(A) June 30, 2008; or

(B) June 30, 2012, if that total is less than the total under (A) of this paragraph, and the employer is a municipality in which the population decreased by more than 25 percent between 2000 and 2010, according to the decennial census conducted by the United States Bureau of the Census.

(b) The administrator shall allocate contributions received for full payment of

(1) the actuarially determined employer normal cost for the plan; and

(2) all contributions required by AS 39.30.370 and AS 39.35.750 for the fiscal year.

(c) If, after allocation of contributions under (b) of this section, a portion of the employer contributions remains, the administrator shall apply that remaining portion toward payment of the past service liability of the plan.

(d) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, the annual employer contribution rate may not be less than the rate sufficient to allow payment of the employer normal cost and the employer contributions required under AS 39.30.370 and AS 39.35.750.

(e) An employer of a retired member rehired under AS 39.35.150 shall include that member's base salary when calculating the contribution amount established in (a) of this section.

(f) All or a portion of the employer's share of any accrued actuarial liability to the plan may be prepaid in a lump sum. The commissioner may, by regulation, establish a minimum amount for the lump sum payment of a portion. The commissioner shall charge to the employer appropriate and reasonable costs to the plan attributable to a lump sum payment that are not greater than administrative costs applied to other employer contributions. If a lump sum payment is made, the payment shall be accounted for separately in accordance with regulations adopted by the commissioner. The regulations must provide for crediting to each lump sum payment account all earnings and losses received from investment of that payment. The lump sum payment shall be used solely to offset contributions under this section required of the employer that made the payment or on whose behalf the payment was made, taking into account earnings and losses from its investment. A lump sum payment made by or on behalf of an employer under this subsection, together with all earnings and losses from investment of that payment, may not be considered in calculating that employer's share of any discretionary payment authorized by the state that benefits multiple employers.

(g) If all or a portion of the employer's share of any accrued actuarial liability to the plan is prepaid in a lump sum under (f) of this section, the administrator shall calculate a revised employer contribution rate for that employer in recognition of that prepayment not more than 30 days following the prepayment.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the state as an employer shall contribute to the system every payroll period an amount sufficient to pay the actuarially determined employer normal cost, all contributions required under AS 39.30.370 and AS 39.35.750, and past service cost for members at the contribution rate adopted by the board under AS 37.10.220 for the fiscal year for that payroll period.

(i) In this section, "normal cost" means the cost of providing the benefits expected to be credited, with respect to service, to all active members of the plan during the year beginning after the last valuation date.

###### Sec. 39.35.300.   Employment with the state.

(a) An active employee is entitled to credited service for periods of employment with the state after January 1, 1961, regardless of the office, department, division, or agency of the state in which the person was employed. For purposes of AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680, the University of Alaska is not an office, department, division, or agency of the state. Service credit may not be granted under AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680 for service that is creditable under the teachers' retirement system, AS 14.25, or for a person's service as a public officer, as defined in AS 39.52.960, a legislator, or a legislative director, if the service occurs on or after the date the person commits a criminal offense from which a pension forfeiture under AS 37.10.310 results.

(b) A permanent part-time employee of the state receives credited service on a pro rata basis to that which would have been earned as a permanent full-time employee.

(c) A noncertificated employee of the Alaska Vocational Technical Center or a state boarding school who first becomes a member of the plan on or after July 1, 1999, may, within 90 days after the employee first joins the plan, make an election under this subsection to have the years of service that the employee earns as a noncertificated employee determined using the table for service on or after July 1, 1969, that is set out in the definition of "year of service" in AS 14.25.220. A noncertificated employee of the Alaska Vocational Technical Center or a state boarding school who is an active member of the plan on July 1, 1999, may, within 180 days after July 1, 1999, make the election. A member of the plan who is an inactive member on July 1, 1999, and who is later employed as a noncertificated employee of the Alaska Vocational Technical Center or a state boarding school may, within 90 days after beginning the subsequent employment, make the election. An election under this subsection is irrevocable except as provided in (d) of this section and shall be made in writing on a form provided by the administrator. The election applies to the employee's service earned for the school year in which the election is accepted by the administrator and applies to all subsequent employment as a noncertificated employee of a state boarding school, a school district or regional educational attendance area, the special education service agency, or the Alaska Vocational Technical Center. An employee who makes an election under this subsection shall pay the contribution surcharge as set out in AS 39.35.160(c).

(d) A noncertificated employee who has made an election under (c) of this section and who thereafter changes employment status from working for less than a full year, whether part-time or full time, to working for a full year, whether part-time or full-time, may, between July 1 and September 30, revoke the election and cease payment of the contribution surcharge. A revocation under this subsection is retroactive to July 1 of the school year, as defined in AS 14.25.220, in which the revocation is made.

(e) A noncertificated employee who has not made an election under (c) of this section who changes employment status from working for a full year, whether part-time or full-time, to working for less than a full year, whether part-time or full-time, may, between July 1 and September 30, make the election and begin paying the contribution surcharge. The election is retroactive to July 1 of the school year, as defined in AS 14.25.220, in which the election is made.

###### Sec. 39.35.310.   Employment with other employers.

(a) An active employee is entitled to credited service for periods of employment with a political subdivision or a public organization beginning with the effective date of the employer's participation in the plan.  The employee is also entitled to credited service for periods of employment as designated in the employer's participation agreement.

(b) A permanent part-time employee of a political subdivision or a public organization receives credited service on a basis proportionate to that which would have been earned as a permanent full-time employee.

(c) A noncertificated employee of a school district, a regional educational attendance area, or the special education service agency who first becomes a member of the plan on or after July 1, 1999, may, within 90 days after the employee first joins the plan, make an election under this subsection to have the years of service that the employee earns as a noncertificated employee determined using the table for service on or after July 1, 1969, that is set out in the definition of "year of service" in AS 14.25.220. A noncertificated employee of a school district, a regional educational attendance area, or the special education service agency who is an active member of the plan on July 1, 1999, may, within 180 days after July 1, 1999, make the election. A member of the plan who is an inactive member on July 1, 1999, and who later is employed as a noncertificated employee of a school district, a regional educational attendance area, or the special education service agency may, within 90 days after beginning the subsequent employment, make the election. An election under this subsection is irrevocable except as provided in (d) of this section and shall be made in writing on a form provided by the administrator. The election applies to the employee's service earned for the school year in which the election is accepted by the administrator and applies to all subsequent employment as a noncertificated employee of a state boarding school, a school district or regional educational attendance area, the special education service agency, or the Alaska Vocational Technical Center. An employee who makes an election under this subsection shall pay the contribution surcharge as set out in AS 39.35.160(c).

(d) A noncertificated employee who has made an election under (c) of this section and who thereafter changes employment status from working for less than a full year, whether part-time or full-time, to working for a full year, whether part-time or full-time, may, between July 1 and September 30, revoke the election and cease payment of the contribution surcharge. A revocation under this subsection is retroactive to the beginning of the school year, as defined in AS 14.25.220, in which the revocation was made.

(e) A noncertificated employee who has not made an election under (c) of this section who changes employment status from working for a full year, whether part-time or full-time, to working for less than a full year may, between July 1 and September 30, make the election and begin paying the contribution surcharge. The election is retroactive to July 1 of the school year, as defined in AS 14.25.220, in which the election was made.

###### Sec. 39.35.320.   Transfers between employers. [Repealed,ยง55 ch 128 SLA 1977.]

###### Sec. 39.35.330.   Leave of absence.

(a) A leave of absence with pay authorized by an employer is not considered as interrupting employment.  If the employee is a permanent part-time employee, credited service shall be granted on a basis proportionate to that which would have been earned as a permanent full-time employee.

(b) A leave or leaves of absence without pay exceeding 10 accumulated working days in any calendar year or layoff status authorized by an employer shall be considered as an interruption of employment and credited service may not be granted.

(c) Notwithstanding (b) of this section, an employee who takes more than 10 days leave of absence without pay in a calendar year because the employee is unable to work due to an on-the-job injury or occupational illness for which the employee is receiving benefits under AS 23.30 may elect to receive credited service for the time on leave of absence without pay status. When an employee elects to receive credited service under this subsection, an indebtedness is established. The amount of the indebtedness is equal to the contributions that the employee would have made if the employee had been working, less the sum of contributions that the employee made for those periods of time and an amount equal to contributions that would have been made for the first 10 days of leave without pay. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on the indebtedness beginning on the date that the employee returns to work or terminates employment. If there is an outstanding indebtedness at the time the employee is appointed to retirement, benefits shall be actuarially adjusted.

(d) An employee of a school district, a regional educational attendance area, or a state boarding school who is assaulted while on the job and who, as a result of a physical injury from the assault, is placed on leave without pay, whether or not the employee receives workers' compensation benefits under AS 23.30 for the injury, is entitled to accrue credited service while the employee, because of the injury, is on leave-without-pay status or is receiving the benefits under AS 23.30. Entitlement to credited service under this subsection ends when the employee is eligible to receive benefits under AS 39.35.370(a) or 39.35.410(a).

###### Sec. 39.35.340.   Military service.

(a) A vested employee is entitled to credited service for active military service in the armed forces of the United States, either by enlistment or induction, if the employee received a discharge under honorable conditions and is not entitled to receive retirement benefits from the United States government for the same service.  The credited service allowed may not exceed an aggregate period of five years. Benefits are not payable on credited service for military service unless the employee makes retroactive contributions to the plan for the period of time that service credit is claimed. However, if the employee was in the employ of an employer on the date of entry into the armed forces and returned to the employ of an employer within 90 days after the date of discharge from military service, the employee is not required to make retroactive contributions under this plan for the period of credited service.

(b) In order to obtain credited service under this section, an employee shall make an election to do so and shall verify the period of military service. When eligibility for credited service for military service has been established, an indebtedness shall be determined as follows:

(1) determine the employee's actual compensation, or the calculated annual compensation for those employees working less than 12 months, during the calendar year 1976 or the year in which an employee first becomes vested under AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680, whichever is later;

(2) multiply the amount determined under (1) of this subsection by the number of years of military service credited under this section;

(3) multiply the product determined under (2) of this subsection by six percent for members who are first eligible to claim this military service before January 1, 1987, or eight and one-half percent for members who are first eligible to claim this military service on or after January 1, 1987.

(c) A retired employee on July 1, 1976, is eligible to receive increased benefits based upon military service as described in (a) of this section. To receive credited service for military service, a retired employee shall verify the military service. When verified, a retired employee is entitled to receive an increased benefit that shall be actuarially adjusted to reflect the employee's indebtedness for that credit.  The indebtedness shall be calculated in the same manner as described in (b) of this section except that it shall be based on the average monthly compensation used in calculating the benefit. The effective date of this increased benefit is the beginning of the month following that in which eligibility has been established.

(d) The credited service granted under this section may not be used to satisfy the credited service requirements for normal retirement.

(e) A deferred vested employee on July 1, 1976, is eligible to claim credited service under (a) of this section.  In order to obtain credited service under this section, such an employee shall make an election to do so and shall verify the period of military service.  When eligibility for military service has been established, an indebtedness shall be determined as follows: the employee's actual compensation, or the calculated annual compensation for those employees working less than 12 months, during the calendar year the employee terminated, shall be multiplied by six percent; this product shall then be multiplied by the number of years of military service credit under this section.  Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on this indebtedness commencing July 1, 1978.  Any outstanding indebtedness that exists at the time a person is appointed to retirement necessitates an actuarial adjustment to the benefits payable based upon that military service.

(f) An employee may not be credited with a period of active military service in the armed forces of the United States under this section if credit for that military service was granted under AS 14.25.009ยง14.25.220.

(g) A surviving spouse receiving or entitled to receive benefits under AS 39.35.420(b), 39.35.430, or 39.35.440 or benefits under a joint and survivor option filed under AS 39.35.450 is eligible to receive increased benefits based on military service as described in (a) of this section.  To receive credited service for military service, the surviving spouse shall verify the employee's military service.  When verified, the surviving spouse is entitled to receive an increased benefit which shall be actuarially adjusted to reflect the indebtedness for that credit. The indebtedness shall be calculated in the same manner as described in (b) of this section except that it shall be based on the average monthly compensation used in calculating the benefit.  Benefits payable under this subsection are effective the first day of the month following that in which eligibility has been established.

(h) The combined period of military service claimed under this section and under AS 14.25.009ยง14.25.220 may not exceed five years.

(i) Notwithstanding (d) of this section, a member who retires as a peace officer or firefighter may elect to use five or fewer years of credited service granted under this section in computing years of credited service under AS 39.35.535(c). When eligibility for credited service for military service has been established and an election under this subsection has been made, an indebtedness in addition to the indebtedness determined under (b) of this section shall be determined for each year of military service used under this subsection, in an amount based on the increase, if any, in the present value of future benefits for that year as determined by the department.

(j) For indebtedness determined under this section, interest as prescribed by regulation accrues beginning on July 1, 1977, or one year following the date a person first becomes vested, whichever is later. An outstanding indebtedness for pension benefits that exists at the time a person is appointed to retirement necessitates an actuarial adjustment to the pension benefits payable based on credited military service.

(k) Credited service under (a) of this section includes service as a

(1) foreign service officer, a foreign service reserve officer, or a limited foreign service reserve officer with the United States Department of State in Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos from August 4, 1964, through November 7, 1975; and

(2) member of the United States Merchant Marine Service from December 7, 1941, through September 30, 1945.

###### Sec. 39.35.342.   Village public safety officer service.

(a) A vested employee is entitled to credited service for employment as a village public safety officer under the program established under AS 18.65.670 for which the employee has not otherwise received credited service under this plan. An employee is not entitled to credited service for employment as a village public safety officer unless the employee was employed as a village public safety officer for at least one year. The credited service claimed under this section may not exceed five years. Benefits are not payable on credited service for village public safety officer service under this section unless the employee makes retroactive contributions to the plan for the period of time that service credit is claimed.

(b) In order to obtain credited service under this section, an employee shall make an election to do so and shall verify the period of service as a village public safety officer. When eligibility for credited service for village public safety officer service has been established, an indebtedness shall be determined. The amount of the indebtedness is equal to the full actuarial cost of providing benefits based on the service as a village public safety officer. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on this indebtedness beginning on the date the actuarial cost is established. Any outstanding indebtedness that exists at the time a person is appointed to retirement necessitates an actuarial adjustment to the benefits payable based upon service as a village public safety officer.

(c) The credited service granted under this section may not be used to satisfy the credited service requirements for normal retirement.

(d) An employee is not entitled to credited service under this section if the employee is entitled to receive retirement benefits from another employer for the same service under a retirement plan that provides benefits based on defined benefits.

###### Sec. 39.35.345.   Temporary service credit.

(a) A vested employee is entitled to credited service for periods in which the employee regularly rendered full-time personal service to an employer but was not qualified to participate in the plan because of the exclusion of temporary workers as described in AS 39.35.680(22)(C)(iii).  Benefits are not payable on this credited service unless the employee makes retroactive contributions to the plan for the period of time that credited service is claimed.  The retroactive contribution is the full actuarial cost of providing benefits for the credited service claimed.

(b) To obtain credited service under this section, an employee shall elect to do so and shall verify the period of temporary service.  When eligibility for temporary service credit has been established, an indebtedness shall be determined as provided in (a) of this section. Any outstanding indebtedness existing at the time an employee retires requires an actuarial adjustment to the benefits payable based on the temporary service. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on the indebtedness beginning

(1) July 1, 1981, or one year following the date the employee first becomes vested, whichever is later, for an employee who claims temporary service credit no more than one year after the employee becomes vested;

(2) the date of vesting, for an employee who becomes vested after June 30, 1980, who is claiming temporary service credit more than one year after vesting for service performed before the employee vested;

(3) July 1, 1980, for an employee who became vested before July 1, 1980, who is claiming temporary service credit after June 30, 1981, for service performed before July 1, 1980;

(4) one year after completing the temporary service, for an employee who was vested on the last day of employment as a temporary employee and who claims the temporary service no more than one year after completing the service;

(5) on the date of completing the temporary service, for an employee who was vested on the last day of employment as a temporary employee and who claims temporary service more than one year after completing the service.

(c) A deferred vested employee on July 1, 1980, is eligible to claim credited service under (a) of this section.  To obtain credited service under this section, a deferred vested employee shall elect to do so and shall verify the period of temporary service. When eligibility for temporary service credit has been established, an indebtedness shall be determined as provided in (a) of this section.  Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on that indebtedness beginning July 1, 1981.  Any outstanding indebtedness existing at the time a deferred vested employee retires requires an actuarial adjustment to the benefits payable based on the temporary service.

(d) An employee may choose whether the credited service granted under this section is used to satisfy the credited service requirements for normal retirement under AS 39.35.370(a)(2) or (3) or 39.35.385(f) or is only used for the calculation of benefits. An election under this subsection is irrevocable and applies to all temporary credited service that the employee has accrued when the employee retires. An election under this subsection does not change the date that an employee is considered to have commenced participation in the plan under AS 39.35.120.

(e) Notwithstanding the requirement in (a) of this section that an employee be vested to claim credited service under this section, for purposes of a conditional service retirement benefit under AS 39.35.385(f), an employee may claim credited service under this section for temporary legislative employment before July 1, 1979, for which the employee has not received credited service under AS 39.35.360(g).

###### Sec. 39.35.350.   Reinstatement of credited service. [Repealed,ยง133 ch 9 FSSLA 2005.]

###### Sec. 39.35.360.   Earlier service.

(a) An employee who completes three years of credited service with the state after January 1, 1961, for which the employee makes contributions required by AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680 is entitled to credited service for service rendered (1) before January 1, 1961, as an employee of the state and former Territory of Alaska; (2) before January 1, 1961, as an employee of the United States government in Alaska, excluding service in the armed forces of the United States; (3) after January 1, 1961, as a peace officer, correctional officer, or firefighter of a participating political subdivision of the state if the employee is vested and is an active peace officer, correctional officer, or firefighter in the plan on or before January 1, 1983; or (4) after January 1, 1961, as a special officer commissioned by the state troopers if the employee has not otherwise received credit for the service and if the employee was employed on or before January 1, 1983, is vested, and has been an active special officer, peace officer, correctional officer, or firefighter in the plan. The retirement benefits payable to an employee under this section shall be reduced by the amount of the retirement pension benefits paid to the employee by the United States government for the same period of service.

(b) An employee who, under (a) of this section, is entitled to credited service for employment before January 1, 1961, is not required to make retroactive contributions under AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680.

(c)  [Repealed,ยง41 ch 146 SLA 1980.]

(d)  [Repealed,ยง2 ch 26 SLA 1974.]

(e) An employee of a detention facility provided by a local government unit to the territorial or state government under AS 33.30.031 or former AS 33.30.060, who continues in state employment upon transfer of the facility to the state, is entitled to credited service for prior service with the facility if the employee remains in continuous employment with the state until July 1, 1976. To obtain credited service the employee is required to make retroactive contributions for the period of service between January 1, 1961, and the effective date of the transfer of the facility to the state.

(f) A surviving spouse receiving or entitled to receive a surviving spouse's pension under AS 39.35.440 or benefits under a joint and survivor option filed under AS 39.35.450 is eligible for increased benefits for any service credit authorized under (a) of this section, but not claimed or authorized by law before the employee's death.

(g) An employee is eligible to receive up to 10 years of credited service for service rendered before July 1, 1979, as a temporary employee of the legislature of the state or territory during legislative sessions. To receive retroactive credited service under this subsection, an employee shall claim the service before July 1, 2003, or before retiring, whichever occurs first. When the employee claims the service, an indebtedness of the employee to the plan shall be established. For benefits that do not vary based on the amount of retroactive credited service, the indebtedness shall be established on the date the employee claims the credit, with interest accruing on the indebtedness beginning July 1, 2003. For benefits that vary based on the amount of retroactive credited service, the indebtedness shall be established on the date the employee retires, with interest accruing on the indebtedness beginning on the date of retirement. Any outstanding indebtedness that exists at the time the employee retires requires an actuarial adjustment to the benefits that are based upon retroactive credited service under this subsection.

(h) An employee of the state is eligible to receive credited service under AS 39.35.300(b) for service rendered as a permanent part-time employee before January 1, 1976. When the employee claims retroactive credited service, an indebtedness of the employee to the plan shall be established. The amount of this indebtedness is equal to the contributions the employee would have made if the employee had been eligible for membership in the plan. The rate used to calculate the contributions may not be less than the rate in effect on January 1, 1961. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on the indebtedness beginning July 1, 1981, for employees claiming the service before that date, and beginning July 1, 1980, for employees claiming the service on or after July 1, 1981. Any outstanding indebtedness that exists at the time the employee retires requires an actuarial adjustment to the benefits that are based on retroactive credited service under this subsection.

(i) An employee who completes three years of credited service with an employer, for which the employee makes contributions required by AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680, is entitled to credited service on a year-for-year basis for service credited in the Civil Service Retirement System, rendered as an employee of an Alaska Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) school, other than service as a teacher. When eligibility for retroactive credited service under this subsection has been established, an indebtedness of the employee to the plan shall be determined as follows: (1) the employee's actual annual compensation, or the calculated annual compensation for an employee who works fewer than 12 months, for the most recent calendar year in which service is rendered to an employer before the calendar year in which the employee first becomes eligible to claim service under this subsection, multiplied by (2) the number of years of service in Alaska BIA schools that is credited under this subsection, and this product multiplied by (3) six percent for employees first eligible to claim this service before January 1, 1987, or eight and one-half percent for employees first eligible to claim this service on or after January 1, 1987. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on the indebtedness beginning on the date the employee may first claim the retroactive credited service. Any outstanding indebtedness that exists at the time the employee retires requires an actuarial adjustment to the benefits that are based on retroactive credited service under this subsection. A retirement benefit payable under this subsection for Alaska BIA service shall be reduced by an amount equal to the retirement benefits paid to the member by the United States government for the same service.

(j) An employee who has not completed three years of credited service with an employer may claim credited service as an employee of an Alaska Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) school, other than service as a teacher under (i) of this section if, on the date of transfer of the Alaska BIA school to the state, the employee is employed at the school and needs fewer than three additional years of continuous full-time employment for normal retirement in the federal Civil Service Retirement System, and the employee completes a period of service with an employer, for which the employer makes contributions required by AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680, equal to the additional period of service that would have been required for that employee's normal retirement under the federal Civil Service Retirement System. An employee who claims credited service under this subsection shall provide federal government verification of the employee's federal Civil Service Retirement System status when the claim is filed.

(k) A vested member is eligible to receive credited service for employment after January 1, 1961, as a peace officer or firefighter in a municipality that is an employer under this plan but that was not an employer at the time of the employment. A vested member who claims retroactive credited service on or after July 1, 1988, is indebted to the plan. The amount of the indebtedness is the full actuarial cost of providing benefits for the credited service claimed. Interest as established by regulation accrues on the indebtedness under this subsection beginning the first of the month following establishment of the indebtedness. Any outstanding indebtedness that exists at the time the officer or firefighter retires requires an actuarial adjustment to the benefits that are based on retroactive credited service under this subsection.

(l) An administrative director of the Alaska Court System who withdraws from the judicial retirement system under AS 22.25.012(b) is eligible for membership in the plan and shall receive credited service in this plan for service rendered as administrative director. To be eligible for membership in this plan under this subsection, the administrative director must contribute to the plan

(1) the amount that would have been contributed if the administrative director had been a member during the period of the membership in the judicial retirement system; and

(2) any contributions for service as administrative director refunded from the plan at the time the administrative director became a member of the judicial retirement system.

#### Article 7. Benefits.

###### Sec. 39.35.370.   Retirement benefits.

(a) Subject to AS 39.35.450, a terminated employee is eligible for a normal retirement benefit

(1) at age 60 with at least five years credited service;

(2) with at least 20 years of credited service as a peace officer or firefighter; or

(3) with at least 30 years of credited service for all other employees.

(b) Subject to AS 39.35.450, a terminated employee is eligible for an early retirement benefit at age 55 with at least five years credited service. An actuarial adjustment shall be made to retirement benefits paid under this section for an early retirement benefit. The monthly amount of a retirement benefit that would be due under (c) of this section shall be reduced by multiplying one-half of one percent times the number of months, to the nearest month, by which the retirement date of the employee falls short of the date that the employee reaches age 60.

(c) The monthly amount of a retirement benefit for a peace officer or firefighter is two percent of the average monthly compensation times the years of credited service through 10 years, plus two and one-half percent of the average monthly compensation times the years of service over 10 years.  For all other employees it is

(1) two percent of the average monthly compensation times all years of service before July 1, 1986, and for years of service through a total of 10 years; plus

(2) two and one-quarter percent of the average monthly compensation times all years of service after June 30, 1986, over 10 years of total service through 20 years; plus

(3) two and one-half percent of the average monthly compensation times all years of service after June 30, 1986, over 20 years of total service.

(d) The monthly amount of a retirement benefit for a deferred vested member shall be determined in accordance with (c) of this section as it was in effect on the date of the employee's termination of employment.

(e) Benefits payable under this section accrue from the first day of the month after which all of the following requirements are met: (1) the member meets the eligibility requirements of this section; (2) the member terminates employment; and (3) the member applies for retirement.  The benefits are payable the last day of the month.  If payment is delayed, a retroactive payment shall be made to cover the period of deferment.  The last payment shall be made for the month in which a benefit is payable under this section.

(f) A member who is vested in the plan as a peace officer or firefighter at the time the member incurs a permanent disability of at least 33 1/3 percent under workers' compensation and who (1) undergoes retraining because of the disability; and (2) is subsequently employed with the state or other employer in a position other than peace officer or firefighter, is eligible for a normal retirement benefit as a peace officer or firefighter under (a) and (c) of this section upon completing 20 years of credited service.

(g) When an employee who was employed as a dispatcher in a state trooper office or in a police or fire department in the plan applies for appointment to retirement, the employee may convert the credited service for that position to credited service as a peace officer by claiming the service as peace officer service. An employee who has converted credited service to peace officer service under this subsection shall be treated as a peace officer for purposes of AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680. When the member claims this credited service as peace officer service, an indebtedness of the member to the plan shall be established. The indebtedness is equal to the full actuarial cost of the conversion of the credited service to treatment as peace officer service. Any outstanding indebtedness that exists at the time the member is appointed to retirement shall require an actuarial adjustment to the benefits payable based upon the conversion of the credited service.

(h) When an employee applies for appointment to retirement in the plan, the employee may convert the credited service to which this subsection applies to credited service as a peace officer by claiming the service as peace officer service. This subsection applies to credited service as an employee of a state correctional facility, other than as a correctional officer or correctional superintendent. This subsection also applies to credited service as an employee of the Department of Corrections in a management position in the division that has responsibility for institutions or the division that has responsibility for community corrections if the employee also has at least five years of credited service as a probation officer, correctional officer, assistant correctional superintendent, or correctional superintendent at a state correctional facility. An employee who has converted credited service to peace officer service under this subsection shall be treated as a peace officer for purposes of AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680. When the member claims this credited service as peace officer service, an indebtedness of the member to the plan shall be established. The indebtedness is equal to the full actuarial cost of the conversion of the credited service to treatment as peace officer service. Any outstanding indebtedness that exists at the time the member is appointed to retirement will require an actuarial adjustment to the benefits payable based upon the conversion of the credited service. In this subsection,

(1) "correctional facility" has the meaning given in AS 33.30.901; and

(2) "management position" includes positions as division director, deputy director, and assistant director.

(i) For plan fiscal years beginning after December 31, 1975, and notwithstanding any other provision of AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680, the projected annual benefit provided by AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680 and the benefit from all other defined benefit plans required to be aggregated with the benefits from this plan under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 415 may not increase to an amount in excess of the amount permitted under 26 U.S.C. 415 at any time. In the event that any projected annual benefit of a member exceeds the limitation of 26 U.S.C. 415(g) for a limitation year, the plan shall take any necessary remedial action to correct an excess accrued annual benefit. The provisions of 26 U.S.C. 415, and the regulations adopted under that statute, as applied to qualified defined benefit plans of governmental employers are incorporated as part of the terms and conditions of the plan. This subsection applies to any member of this plan.

(j) Notwithstanding (c) of this section,

(1) for the plan fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1996, the annual compensation of a member who joined the plan after the first day of the first plan fiscal year beginning after December 31, 1995, that is used to calculate the member's average monthly compensation may not exceed $150,000, as adjusted for the cost of living in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(17)(B);

(2) for the plan fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the annual compensation limitation for such a member, which is so taken into account for such a member which is so taken into account for such purposes, may not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for the cost of living in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(17)(B);

(3) the cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies in this subsection to a determination period beginning in the calendar year.

(k) [Repealed,ยง116(a) ch 20 SLA 2007.]

###### Sec. 39.35.371.   Distribution requirements.

(a) The entire interest of a member must be distributed or must begin to be distributed not later than the member's required beginning date.

(b) If a member dies after the distribution of the member's interest has begun but before the distribution has been completed, the remaining portion of the interest shall continue to be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used before the member's death.

(c) If a member has made a distribution election and dies before the distribution of the member's interest begins, distribution of the member's entire interest shall be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. However, if any portion of the member's interest is payable to a designated beneficiary, distributions may be made over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period not greater than the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, commencing on or before December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, and if the designated beneficiary is the member's surviving spouse, the date distributions are required to begin may not be earlier than the later of December 31 of the calendar year (1) immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or (2) in which the member would have attained 70 1/2 years of age, whichever is earlier. If the surviving spouse dies after the member but before payments to the spouse have begun, the provisions of this subsection apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. An amount paid to a child of the member will be treated as if it were paid to the surviving spouse if the amount becomes payable to the surviving spouse when the child reaches the age of majority.

(d) If a member has not made a distribution election before the member's death, the member's designated beneficiary must elect the method of distribution not later than December 31 of the calendar year (1) in which distributions would be required to begin under this section, or (2) that contains the fifth anniversary of the date of death of the member, whichever is earlier. If the member does not have a designated beneficiary or if the designated beneficiary does not elect a method of distribution, distribution of the member's entire interest must be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death.

(e) For purposes of (c) of this section, distribution of a member's interest is considered to begin (1) on the member's required beginning date, or (2) if the designated beneficiary is the member's surviving spouse and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before payments to the spouse have begun, on the date distribution is required to begin to the surviving spouse. If distribution in the form of an annuity irrevocably commences to the member before the required beginning date, the date distribution is considered to begin is the date that the distribution actually commences.

(f) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680, the requirements of this section apply to all distributions of a member's interest and take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680.

(g) All distributions required under this section are determined and made in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9) and regulations adopted under that statute, including any minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement.

(h) Unless otherwise specified, the provisions of this section apply to calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 1983.

(i) In this section,

(1) "designated beneficiary" means the individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9) and regulations adopted under that statute;

(2) "required beginning date" means the first day of April of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the member either attains 70 1/2 years of age or actually retires, whichever is later.

###### Sec. 39.35.375.   Public service benefit.

(a) An active or inactive member who has never been vested in this plan or in the teachers' retirement plan under AS 14.25.009ยง14.25.220, who has at least two years of credited service in this plan, and who has membership service in the teachers' retirement system may claim credited service in this plan in an amount equal to the membership service the member has in the teachers' retirement system. The claimed credited service may be added to service earned under AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680 to enable the member to qualify for a public service benefit under this section. The member may not claim credited service for membership service for which the member has received a refund under AS 14.25.150. The member may not claim credited service in this plan based on unused sick leave under AS 14.25.115.

(b) To claim credited service under this section, the member shall file a written request with the administrator when the member applies to retire. The administrator shall determine the full actuarial cost of benefits based on the member's total credited service and shall transfer from the teachers' retirement system to this plan an amount equal to the sum of the member contributions and any indebtedness payments to the teachers' retirement system and the employer contributions to the teachers' retirement system made on behalf of the employee together with interest earned on those contributions and indebtedness payments. If the amount to be transferred, when combined with the amount of employee contributions and indebtedness payments to this plan and the amount of employer contributions on behalf of the employee in this plan, and interest earned on contributions and indebtedness payments for the employee, is less than the full actuarial cost computed under this subsection, an indebtedness to the plan equal to the amount of the difference is established. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on the indebtedness. The member must pay any outstanding indebtedness existing at the time the member applies for retirement in full before the member is appointed to retirement under this section.

(c) A member is entitled to receive a public service benefit under this section if the member has at least a total of five years credited service under AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680 and credited service from the teachers' retirement plan under AS 14.25.009ยง14.25.220 claimed under this section. A public service benefit shall be calculated using the higher of the average monthly compensation for service in this plan or the average base salary for service in the teachers' retirement plan under AS 14.25.009ยง14.25.220. The amount of the benefit shall be calculated in accordance with AS 39.35.370(c).

(d) Credited service earned under either this plan or the teachers' retirement system that has been claimed for a public service benefit under this section may not be used for any other purpose. A member who claims credited service under this section loses all rights to benefits under AS 14.25 based on the claimed credited service. A member may not claim credited service under this section unless the member claims all of the membership service the member has in the teachers' retirement system. A public service benefit does not constitute a normal or early retirement benefit for purposes of qualifying for a conditional service retirement benefit under AS 14.25.125 or AS 39.35.385.

(e) A member whose rights to benefits under AS 14.25 are subject to a qualified domestic relations order may claim credited service under this section. However, the credited service claimed remains subject to the terms of the order.

(f) [Repealed,ยง116(b) ch 20 SLA 2007.]

(g) If a member retires under this section and subsequently returns to work for an employer under this plan or the teachers' retirement system, benefits under this section shall cease during the period of reemployment and shall recommence when the reemployment is ended. The credited service earned during the period of reemployment may not be added to the credited service claimed for a public service benefit under this section. If a member vests and meets the other eligibility requirements under this system or the teachers' retirement system during the reemployment, the member is entitled to a benefit under AS 14.25.009ยง14.25.220 or AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680, as appropriate.

(h) In this section,

(1) "membership service earned under AS 14.25" means membership service earned under AS 14.25.009ยง14.25.220;

(2) "teachers' retirement system" and "teachers' retirement system under AS 14.25" mean the teachers' retirement plan established in AS 14.25.009ยง14.25.220.

###### Sec. 39.35.380.   Early retirement benefits. [Repealed,ยง55 ch 128 SLA 1977.]

###### Sec. 39.35.381.   Alternate benefit for elected public officers.

(a) An elected public officer is eligible for a public officer benefit if the officer is retired under AS 14.25.009ยง14.25.220. Only fully paid credited service as an elected public officer of a municipality or other political subdivision, earned while the municipality or political subdivision was an employer under this plan and while the person was employed full-time under AS 14.25.009ยง14.25.220, may be counted under this section.

(b) Credited service for which contributions were refunded is not creditable under this section unless the refunded contributions have been repaid. For purposes of (a) of this section, a member or former member does not have to be reemployed under this plan in order to pay refunded contributions. Compound interest at the rate prescribed by regulation shall be added to the reinstatement indebtedness from the date of the refund to the date of repayment.

(c) The amount of the monthly elected public officer benefit is two percent of the average monthly compensation for service eligible under this section times those years of service.

(d) When an elected public officer eligible to receive credited service under this section dies, the officer's designated beneficiary is entitled to the balance in the officer's employee contribution account.

(e) A person who retires under this section is not entitled to disability or death benefits under AS 39.35.400ยง39.35.440, a minimum benefit under AS 39.35.485, or to medical benefits under AS 39.35.535. Service earned under this section may not be used for vesting under AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680.

(f) Benefits payable under this section accrue from the first day of the month after which all of the following requirements are met: (1) the elected public officer meets the eligibility requirements of this section; (2) the officer terminates employment under AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680; and (3) the officer applies for retirement. The benefits are payable the last day of the month. If payment is delayed, a retroactive payment shall be made to cover the period of the delay.

(g) An elected public officer may claim credit under this section for service performed as an elected public officer before May 31, 1989. To claim the service, the elected public officer must have been an elected public officer of a municipality or political subdivision that was an employer under this plan during the elected service and must have been employed full-time under AS 14.25 during that time. When the elected public officer claims that service, an indebtedness to the plan is established. The amount of the indebtedness is the full actuarial cost of providing benefits for the service claimed. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on that indebtedness beginning on July 1, 1989. Any outstanding indebtedness existing at the time the person retires requires an actuarial adjustment to the benefits payable based on that service.

###### Sec. 39.35.385.   Conditional service retirement benefits.

(a) Subject to AS 39.35.450, an employee is eligible for a normal retirement benefit at age 60 with at least two years of credited service if the employee also is eligible for a normal retirement salary under AS 14.25 (teachers' retirement system).

(b) Subject to AS 39.35.450, an employee is eligible for an early retirement benefit at age 55 with at least two years of credited service if the employee also is eligible for an early retirement salary under AS 14.25 (teachers' retirement system).

(c) Credited service for which contributions were refunded is not creditable under this section.

(d) The monthly amount of a conditional service retirement benefit shall be calculated on the years of fully paid credited service in accordance with AS 39.35.370(c), except that the member may irrevocably elect to substitute one-twelfth of the "average base salary" as defined in AS 14.25.220(5) in place of average monthly compensation.

(e) Benefits payable under this section accrue from the first day of the month (1) in which the member meets the eligibility requirements of this section, (2) following the date of termination, and (3) following application for retirement, and are payable the last day of the month.  If payment is delayed, a retroactive payment shall be made to cover the period of deferment.  The last payment shall be made for the month in which the member dies or is no longer eligible for a benefit under this section.

(f) Subject to AS 39.35.450, an employee is eligible for a normal retirement benefit at age 60 or an early retirement benefit at age 55 if the employee was first hired as a legislative employee before May 30, 1987, and has at least 60 days of credited service as an employee of the legislature, other than as an employee of the Office of the Ombudsman or the office of victims' rights, during each of five legislative sessions. An employee who was first hired as a legislative employee on or after May 30, 1987, and is otherwise eligible under this subsection must have at least 80 days of credited service during each of five legislative sessions to receive benefits under this subsection.

###### Sec. 39.35.389.   Alternate benefits for EPORS members.

(a) Notwithstanding former AS 39.37.050, a former member of the Alaska Territorial Legislature who is receiving a benefit on June 5, 1989 under the Elected Public Officers Retirement System and who has at least 30 years of credited service in the territorial and state legislatures may elect a benefit under this subsection instead of the benefit under former AS 39.37.050. The monthly amount of a benefit under this subsection is the greater of the member's years of credited service multiplied by

(1) the member's average monthly compensation and that amount multiplied by two percent; or

(2) $100.

(b) Notwithstanding former AS 39.37.060, a surviving spouse receiving a benefit under the Elected Public Officers Retirement System whose spouse met the requirements of (a) of this section at the time of the spouse's death may elect a benefit under this subsection instead of the benefit under former AS 39.37.060. The amount of a benefit under this subsection is 50 percent of the amount calculated for the deceased spouse under (a) of this section.

(c) Benefits payable under this section accrue from the first day of the month following receipt of an application for benefits under this section and are payable on the last day of the month.

###### Sec. 39.35.390.   Deferred retirement benefit. [Repealed,ยง55 ch 128 SLA 1977.]

(2) a life annuity on a full cash refund or term-certain basis; or

(3) installments over a designated period of time.

###### Sec. 39.35.400.   Nonoccupational disability benefits.

(a) An employee is eligible for a nonoccupational disability benefit if the employee's employment is terminated because of a total and apparently permanent nonoccupational disability, as defined in AS 39.35.680, before the employee's normal retirement date and after five or more years of credited service. A member is not entitled to a nonoccupational disability benefit under this section unless the member files an application for the benefit with the administrator within 90 days after the member terminated employment. The board may waive a filing deadline if there are extraordinary circumstances that resulted in the inability to meet the deadline. The board may delegate the authority to waive a filing deadline under this subsection to the administrator.

(b) The nonoccupational disability benefits accrue beginning the first day of the month following termination of employment as a result of the disability and are payable the last day of the month.  If a final determination granting the benefit is not made in time to pay the benefit when due, a retroactive payment shall be made to cover the period of deferment.  The last payment shall be for the first month in which the disabled employee

(1) dies;

(2) recovers from disability;

(3) fails to meet the requirements under (e) of this section or under AS 39.35.415; or

(4) reaches normal retirement age.

(c) If the disabled employee becomes ineligible to receive nonoccupational disability benefits, the employee is entitled to receive a normal or early retirement benefit if the employee would have been eligible for the benefit had employment continued during the period of disability. However, the period of disability does not constitute credited service.

(d) The monthly amount of the nonoccupational disability benefit shall be determined in accordance with AS 39.35.370(c), considering the employee's credited service and compensation before termination of employment.

(e) A disabled employee receiving a nonoccupational disability benefit shall provide the administrator, one year after appointment to disability benefits and once each year thereafter until disability benefits cease, proof of continuing eligibility to receive disability payments under the Social Security Act.  If the disabled employee is otherwise ineligible for a social security payment, the employee shall provide the administrator with sufficient medical evidence once each year to demonstrate that disability payments under the Social Security Act would be payable had the employee been otherwise eligible. If the disabled employee fails to provide the administrator with evidence of continuing eligibility for disability payments under the Social Security Act or other medical evidence required by the administrator within 30 days following each anniversary date, the disability benefits from the plan shall cease.  If that information is subsequently provided to the administrator, benefit payments will resume beginning for the month following that in which the information is provided.  When disability payments under the Social Security Act cease, it is the responsibility of the disabled employee to notify the administrator immediately.

(f) A disabled employee's nonoccupational disability benefit terminates when the employee first attains eligibility for normal retirement.  At that time, retirement benefits will be calculated under AS 39.35.370(c).

###### Sec. 39.35.410.   Occupational disability benefits.

(a) An employee is eligible for an occupational disability benefit if employment is terminated because of a total and apparently permanent occupational disability, as defined in AS 39.35.680, before the employee's normal retirement date.

(b) The occupational disability benefits accrue beginning the first day of the month following termination of employment as a result of the disability and are payable the last day of the month.  If a final determination granting the benefit is not made in time to pay the benefit when due, a retroactive payment shall be made to cover the period of deferment.  The last payment shall be for the first month in which the disabled employee

(1) dies;

(2) recovers from disability;

(3) fails to meet the requirements under (g) of this section or under AS 39.35.415; or

(4) reaches normal retirement age.

(c) If the disabled employee becomes ineligible to receive occupational disability benefits before the normal retirement date, the disabled employee shall then be entitled to receive an early retirement benefit if the employee would have been eligible for the benefit had employment continued during the period of disability.  The period of disability constitutes credited service.

(d) The monthly amount of an occupational disability benefit is 40 percent of the disabled employee's gross monthly compensation at the time of termination due to disability.

(e)  [Repealed,ยง12 ch 123 SLA 1976.]

(f) An employee is not entitled to an occupational disability benefit unless the employee files an application for it with the administrator within 90 days of the date of terminating employment. If the employee is unable to meet a filing requirement of this subsection, it may be waived by the commissioner if there are extraordinary circumstances that resulted in the employee's inability to meet the filing requirement.

(g) A disabled employee receiving an occupational disability benefit shall undergo a medical examination as often as the administrator considers advisable but not more frequently than once each year.  The administrator shall determine the place of the examination and engage the physician or physicians. If, in the judgment of the administrator, the examination indicates that the retired employee is no longer incapacitated because of a total and apparently permanent occupational disability, the administrator may not issue further disability benefits to the employee.

(h) A disabled employee's occupational disability benefit terminates when the disabled employee first attains eligibility for normal retirement.  At that time, the employee's retirement benefit shall be calculated under the provisions of AS 39.35.370(c).

(i) Notwithstanding (h) of this section, at the time a peace officer or firefighter receiving occupational disability benefits under this section first attains eligibility for normal retirement, the employee shall irrevocably elect to receive retirement benefits in the amount calculated as the

(1) monthly occupational disability benefit calculated under (d) of this section; or

(2) employee's retirement benefit calculated under the provisions of AS 39.35.370(c).

(j) Notwithstanding (b)(3) of this section, a peace officer or firefighter who retires under (i) of this section is not subject to the requirements of (g) of this section or AS 39.35.415 during retirement.

###### Sec. 39.35.415.   Reemployment of disabled employees.

An employee appointed to disability benefits under AS 39.35.400 or 39.35.410 shall apply to the division of vocational rehabilitation within 30 days of the date disability benefits commence.  The employee shall be enrolled in a rehabilitation program if the employee meets the eligibility requirements of the division of vocational rehabilitation.  Unless the employee demonstrates cause, benefits shall terminate at the end of the first month in which a disabled employee

(1) fails to report to the division of vocational rehabilitation;

(2) is certified by the division of vocational rehabilitation as failing to cooperate in a vocational rehabilitation program;

(3) fails to interview for a job; or

(4) fails to accept a position offered.

###### Sec. 39.35.420.   Nonoccupational death benefits.

(a) If the death of an employee occurs from nonoccupational causes after completing less than one year of credited service, the employee's designated beneficiary shall be paid the balance of the employee contribution account.  If the death of an employee occurs from nonoccupational causes after completing at least one year but less than five years of credited service, a death benefit shall be paid to the employee's designated beneficiary.  The amount of the death benefit shall be the amount set out in (c) of this section.

(b) If the death of a vested member or deferred vested member occurs from nonoccupational causes and the member designated no person other than the surviving spouse as beneficiary to receive nonoccupational death benefits, the surviving spouse may elect to receive either the amounts set out in (c) of this section or a 50 percent joint and survivor option based on credited service to the date of the employee's death or termination.

###### Sec. 39.35.430.   Occupational death benefit.

(a)  [Repealed,ยง16 ch 123 SLA 1976.]

(b) If (1) the death of an employee occurs before the employee's retirement and before the employee's normal retirement date, and (2) the proximate cause of death is a bodily injury sustained or a hazard undergone while in the performance and within the scope of the employee's duties, and (3) the injury or hazard is not the proximate result of wilful negligence of the employee, a monthly survivor's pension shall be paid to the surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse or if the spouse later dies, the monthly survivor's pension shall be paid in equal parts to the dependent children of the employee. On the date the normal retirement of the employee would have occurred if the employee had lived, monthly payments shall equal the monthly amount of the normal retirement benefit to which the employee, had the employee lived and continued employment until the employee's normal retirement date, would have been entitled with an average monthly compensation as existed at death and the credited service to which the employee would have been entitled.

(c) The first payment of the surviving spouse's pension or of a dependent child's pension shall be made for the month following the month in which the employee dies and payment shall cease to be made beginning with the month in which there is no surviving spouse or no dependent child.

(f) If the death of an employee occurs from occupational causes but no surviving spouse or dependent children exist at the time of the death or if the employee designates as beneficiary under AS 39.35.490 someone other than the surviving spouse or dependent children, the employee's designated beneficiary is entitled to receive those benefits available to a beneficiary under AS 39.35.420(c) and an occupational death benefit may not be paid to the surviving spouse or dependent children.

(g) The monthly survivor's pension in (b) of this section for survivors of employees who were not peace officers or firefighters is 40 percent of the employee's monthly compensation in the month in which the employee dies.  The monthly survivor's pension in (b) of this section for survivors of employees who were peace officers or firefighters is the greater of

(1) 50 percent of the monthly compensation in the month in which the employee dies; or

(2) 75 percent of the employee's retirement benefit calculated under the provisions of AS 39.35.370(c) if the employee had survived to normal retirement age.

(h) If an employee's death is caused by an act of assault, assassination, or terrorism directly related to the person's status as an employee, whether the act occurs on or off the employee's job site, the death shall be considered to have occurred in the performance of and within the scope of the employee's duties for purposes of (b)(2) of this section. If the expressed or apparent motive and intent of the perpetrator of the harm inflicted upon the employee was due to the performance of the employee's job duties or employment, the death shall be considered to be directly related to the employee's status as an employee.

If the death of an employee occurs from occupational causes but no surviving spouse or dependent children exist at the time of the death, or if the employee designates as beneficiary under AS 39.35.490 someone other than the surviving spouse or dependent children, the administrator shall pay the employee's designated beneficiary those benefits available to a beneficiary under AS 39.35.420(c) and may not pay an occupational death benefit to the surviving spouse or dependent children.

(c) The first payment of the surviving spouse's pension or of a dependent child's pension shall accrue from the first day of the month following the employee's death and is payable the last day of the month.

###### Sec. 39.35.450.   Joint and survivor option.

(a) Benefits payable under this section are in place of benefits payable under AS 39.35.370, 39.35.385, and former AS 39.35.460. Upon filing an application with the administrator or when a disabled employee first attains eligibility for normal retirement under AS 39.35.400(f) or 39.35.410(h), the employee shall designate the person who is the employee's spouse at the time of appointment to retirement as the contingent beneficiary. However, if the designation of the spouse is revoked under (c) of this section, the employee may designate a dependent approved by the administrator as the contingent beneficiary or may take normal or early retirement under AS 39.35.370 or 39.35.385 or, if the employee was first hired before July 1, 1996, benefit payments under the level income option under former AS 39.35.460. The administrator shall pay benefits under the option elected by the employee. The employee may elect an option that provides that the employee is entitled to receive a reduced benefit payable for life, and, after the employee's death, the contingent beneficiary is entitled to payments in the amount of

(1) 75 percent of the reduced benefit payable for life; or

(2) 50 percent of the reduced benefit payable for life.

(b) The aggregate of the pension payments expected to be paid to an employee and the contingent beneficiary under the options set out in (a) of this section shall be the actuarial equivalent of the pension that the employee is otherwise entitled to receive upon retirement.

(c) An employee may elect or change an option without the approval of the administrator if the election or change is filed in writing with the administrator before the effective date of the employee's retirement.  An employee may revoke a joint and survivor option if the employee files with the administrator before the effective date of the employee's retirement a revocation and consent to the revocation signed by the employee's present spouse and each person entitled to benefits under a qualified domestic relations order on forms provided by the administrator.  The administrator may waive the requirement for written consent from

(1) a person entitled under the order if the person cannot be located or for another reason established by regulation; or

(2) the spouse if

(A) the employee is not married;

(B) the employee was not married to the spouse during any period of the employee's employment with an employer;

(C) the spouse has no rights to the option because of the terms of a qualified domestic relations order;

(D) the spouse cannot be located;

(E) the employee and the spouse have been married for less than two years and the employee establishes that they are not cohabiting; or

(F) another reason is established under regulations of the administrator.

(d) A member, including a deferred vested member, may, regardless of age, elect a joint and survivor option any time before appointment to receive a retirement benefit.

(e) If either the employee or contingent beneficiary dies before the employee is appointed to retirement, the election becomes inoperative.  Once the employee is appointed to retirement, the election is irrevocable.  If a retired employee is reemployed and is subsequently reappointed to retirement, those benefits earned during the period of reemployment are subject to the initial election made under this section, unless the contingent beneficiary is deceased.  If the contingent beneficiary is deceased, the benefits earned during the period of reemployment are subject to AS 39.35.370 or this section if another contingent beneficiary was elected during the period of reemployment.  All other benefits earned during prior periods of employment are subject to the election at the time the employee was appointed to retirement.  If death occurs from nonoccupational causes during the period of reemployment, those benefits earned while reemployed are subject to AS 39.35.420(b). All other benefits earned during prior periods of employment are subject to the election at the time the employee was appointed to retirement.  If death occurs from occupational causes during the period of reemployment, all benefits earned during all periods of employment are subject to AS 39.35.430(b) and (c).

(f) The employee and any person claiming to be a contingent beneficiary shall file with the administrator a marriage certificate, divorce or dissolution judgment, or other evidence necessary to determine the applicability of this section and the identity of any contingent beneficiary.

(g) If the administrator determines, based on the affidavit of the employee and other evidence that an employee is eligible to elect a form of payment other than a joint and survivor option under this section, and no contrary evidence is presented to the administrator within 60 days after the effective date of the employee's retirement, a claim under this section, made by a spouse or former spouse of the member, may not be paid if payment would result in an increase in actuarial liability to the plan.

(h) If an employee fails to elect an option under this section, and if no effective revocation is filed with the administrator, the employee is considered to have elected the option provided in (a)(2) of this section.

(a) Each employee shall designate the beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the administrator shall distribute benefits payable under AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680 as a consequence of the employee's death. Notwithstanding a previous designation of beneficiary, a person who is the spouse of an employee at the time of the employee's death automatically becomes the designated beneficiary if the spouse was married to the employee during part of the employee's employment for an employer

(b) Except as provided in (a) of this section, the designation may be changed or revoked by the employee without notice to the beneficiary or beneficiaries at any time.  If an employee designates more than one beneficiary, each shares equally unless the employee specifies a different allocation or preference.

If the commissioner of administration finds that there is reason to believe that one or more of the conditions set out in (b) of this section have not been met, the administrator shall notify the member or beneficiary that an adjustment will be made to recover the overpayment. A member or beneficiary who receives notice of adjustment under this subsection may file a request with the commissioner of administration for a waiver of the adjustment under AS 39.35.522. An adjustment may not be required while the waiver request is pending.

(d) The plan shall pay interest on amounts owed to a member or beneficiary.  Interest shall be charged on amounts owed to the plan by a member or beneficiary if the amount owed is the result of erroneous information supplied by the member or beneficiary, or the member or beneficiary had reasonable grounds to believe the amount of the benefit was in error. The interest paid under this subsection is at the rate established by regulation for indebtedness contributions owed.  Interest accrues from the date on which the correct payment was due and continues until an actuarial adjustment to the benefit is effective or the amount owed is paid.  Accrued interest in amounts less than the limit established in regulation for writing off small indebtedness and refund balances may not be collected or paid under this subsection.

(d) A decision of the commissioner of administration under this section to deny a waiver under this section may be appealed to the office of administrative hearings. The office of administrative hearings may reverse the decision of the commissioner and may impose conditions on the granting of a waiver which it considers equitable. These conditions may include requiring the member or beneficiary to make additional contributions to the plan.

(b) Except as provided in (a) of this section, the member may change or revoke the designation without notice to the beneficiary or beneficiaries at any time. If a member designates more than one beneficiary, each shares equally unless the member specifies a different allocation or preference.

(a) An employee is eligible for an occupational disability benefit if employment is terminated because of a total and apparently permanent occupational disability before the employee's normal retirement date.

(b) The occupational disability benefits accrue beginning the first day of the month following termination of employment as a result of the disability and are payable the last day of the month. If a final determination granting the benefit is not made in time to pay the benefit when due, a retroactive payment shall be made to cover the period of deferment. The last payment shall be for the first month in which the disabled employee

(1) dies;

(2) recovers from the disability;

(3) fails to meet the requirements under (f), (j), or (m) of this section; or

(4) reaches normal retirement age.

(c) If the disabled employee becomes ineligible to receive occupational disability benefits before the normal retirement date, the disabled employee shall then be entitled to receive retirement benefits if the employee would have been eligible for the benefit had employment continued during the period of disability. The period of disability constitutes membership service in regard to determining eligibility for retirement.

(d) The monthly amount of an occupational disability benefit is 40 percent of the disabled employee's gross monthly compensation at the time of termination due to disability. Notwithstanding AS 39.35.790(b), at the time a member is appointed to disability, the member becomes fully vested in the employer contributions made under AS 39.35.750(a). A disabled member is fully vested in the contributions to the member's individual account made under this subsection. An employee is not entitled to elect distributions from the employee's individual contribution account under AS 39.35.810 while the employee is receiving disability benefits under this section. While an employee is receiving disability benefits, based on the disabled employee's gross monthly compensation at the time of termination due to disability, the employer shall make contributions

(1) to the employee's individual account under AS 39.35.730 on behalf of the employee, without deduction from the employee's disability payments; and

(2) on behalf of the employee under AS 39.35.750.

(e) An employee is not entitled to an occupational disability benefit unless the employee files an application for an occupational disability benefit with the administrator within 90 days after the date of terminating employment. If the employee is unable to meet a filing requirement of this subsection, the filing requirement may be waived by the administrator if there are extraordinary circumstances that resulted in the employee's inability to meet the filing requirement.

(f) A disabled employee receiving an occupational disability benefit shall undergo a medical examination as often as the administrator considers advisable, but not more frequently than once each year. The administrator shall determine the place of the examination and engage the physician or physicians. If, in the judgment of the administrator, the examination indicates that the retired employee is no longer incapacitated because of a total and apparently permanent occupational disability, the administrator may not issue further disability benefits to the employee.

(g) A disabled employee's occupational disability benefit terminates the last day of the month in which the disabled employee first qualifies for normal retirement. At that time, the employee's retirement benefit shall be determined under the provisions of AS 39.35.820ยง39.35.840, 39.35.870, and 39.35.880. An employee whose occupational disability benefit terminates under this subsection shall be considered to have retired directly from the plan.

(h) Notwithstanding (g) of this section, at the time a peace officer or firefighter receiving occupational disability benefits under this section first attains eligibility for normal retirement, the employee shall irrevocably elect to receive retirement benefits in the amount calculated as the

(1) employee's retirement benefit calculated under the provisions of AS 39.35.820ยง39.35.840; or

(2) employee's retirement benefit calculated as if the provisions of AS 39.35.370(c) were to apply; however, pension benefits paid under this paragraph must be paid first from the peace officer's or firefighter's individual contribution account, and the remaining benefits must be paid from the trust account established under AS 39.35.750(e); the peace officer or firefighter may not elect other distributions from the peace officer's or firefighter's individual contribution account under AS 39.35.810.

(i) Notwithstanding (b)(3) of this section, a peace officer or firefighter who retires under (h) of this section is not subject to the requirements of (f) or (j) of this section during retirement.

(j) An employee appointed to disability benefits shall apply to the division of vocational rehabilitation within 30 days after the date disability benefits commence. The employee shall be enrolled in a rehabilitation program if the employee meets the eligibility requirements of the division of vocational rehabilitation. Unless the employee demonstrates cause, benefits shall terminate at the end of the first month in which a disabled employee

(1) fails to report to the division of vocational rehabilitation;

(2) is certified by the division of vocational rehabilitation as failing to cooperate in a vocational rehabilitation program;

(3) fails to interview for a job; or

(4) fails to accept a position offered.

(k) Upon the death of a disabled employee who is receiving or is entitled to receive an occupational disability benefit, the administrator shall pay the surviving spouse a surviving spouse's pension, equal to 40 percent of the employee's monthly compensation at the time of termination of employment because of occupational disability. If there is no surviving spouse, the administrator shall pay the survivor's pension in equal parts to the dependent children of the employee. While the monthly survivor's pension is being paid, the survivor is not entitled to elect distributions from the employee's individual contribution account under AS 39.35.810. The first payment of the surviving spouse's pension or of a dependent child's pension shall accrue from the first day of the month following the employee's death and is payable the last day of the month. The last payment shall be made the last day of the last month in which there is an eligible surviving spouse or dependent child, or the last day of the month in which the employee would have first qualified for normal retirement if the employee had survived, whichever day is sooner. A retirement benefit shall be determined under the provisions of AS 39.35.820ยง39.35.840, 39.35.870, and 39.35.880 based on the date the employee would have first qualified for normal retirement if the employee had survived. In addition to payment of the member's individual account, the surviving spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, the surviving dependent children of the member, shall receive an additional benefit in an amount equal to the accumulated contributions that would have been made to the deceased member's individual account under AS 39.35.730(a) and 39.35.750(a), based on the deceased member's gross monthly compensation at the time of occupational disability, from the time of the member's death to the date the member would have first qualified for normal retirement if the member had survived. Earnings shall be allocated to the additional benefit calculated under this subsection based on the actual rate of return, net of expenses, of the trust account established under AS 39.35.750(e) over the period that the contributions would have been made. This additional amount and allocated earnings shall be paid in the same manner as determined for the member's individual account under AS 39.35.820ยง39.35.860 to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Service. For the purpose of determining eligibility of an employee's survivor who is receiving a benefit under this subsection for medical benefits under AS 39.35.870ยง39.35.880, an employee who died while receiving disability benefits shall be considered to have retired directly from the plan on the date the employee would have first qualified for normal retirement if the employee had survived. The period during which the employee was eligible for a disability benefit and the period during which a survivor's pension is paid to a survivor under this subsection each constitute membership service for the purposes of determining eligibility for medical benefits under AS 39.30.300ยง39.30.495 and AS 39.35.700ยง39.35.990.

(l) While a survivor under (k) of this section is receiving a survivor's pension, the employer of the deceased employee shall make contributions with respect to the survivor based on the deceased employee's gross monthly compensation at the time of termination due to disability

(1) that would have been paid to the employee's individual account under AS 39.35.730 and 39.35.750(a), to the trust account established under AS 39.35.750(e), without deduction from the survivor's pension; and

(2) to the appropriate accounts and funds under AS 39.35.750(b)ยง(e).

(m) In this section, "occupational disability" means a physical or mental condition that the administrator determines presumably permanently prevents an employee from satisfactorily performing the employee's usual duties or the duties of another comparable position or job available to the employee and for which the employee is qualified by training or education; however, the proximate cause of the condition must be a bodily injury sustained, or a hazard undergone, while in the performance and within the scope of the employee's duties and not the proximate result of the wilful negligence of the employee.

###### Sec. 39.35.891.   Disability benefit and disabled peace officer or firefighter retirement benefit adjustment.

(a) Once each year, the administrator shall increase disability benefits and retirement benefits elected by disabled peace officers or firefighters under AS 39.35.890(h)(2). The amount of the increase is a percentage of the current disability benefit or retirement benefit equal to the lesser of 75 percent of the increase in the cost of living in the preceding calendar year or nine percent.

(b) If a disabled member was not receiving a benefit during the entire preceding calendar year, the increase in the benefit under this section shall be adjusted by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months for which the benefit was received in the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which is 12.

(c) If a disabled peace officer or firefighter elects to receive a retirement benefit in the amount calculated under AS 39.35.890(h)(2), the administrator shall, at the time the disabled peace officer or firefighter is appointed to retirement, increase the retirement benefit by a percentage equal to the total cumulative percentage that has been applied to the disabled peace officer's or firefighter's disability benefit under this section.

(d) An increase in benefit payments under this section is effective July 1 of each year and is based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers for Anchorage, Alaska, during the previous calendar year, as determined by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

(e) Benefit adjustments under this section shall terminate the last day of the month following the date on which a disabled member is no longer receiving a disability benefit under AS 39.35.890, unless the member is a disabled peace officer or firefighter and has chosen a retirement benefit under AS 39.35.890(h)(2).

###### Sec. 39.35.892.   Occupational death benefit.

(a) If (1) the death of an employee occurs before the employee's retirement and before the employee's normal retirement date, (2) the proximate cause of death is a bodily injury sustained or a hazard undergone while in the performance and within the scope of the employee's duties, and (3) the injury or hazard is not the proximate result of wilful negligence of the employee, a monthly survivor's pension shall be paid to the surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse or if the spouse later dies, the monthly survivor's pension shall be paid in equal parts to the dependent children of the employee.

(b) The first payment of the surviving spouse's pension or of a dependent child's pension shall be made for the month following the month in which the employee dies. Payments shall cease on the last day of the month in which there is no longer an eligible spouse or eligible dependent child, or the last day of the month following the earliest date the employee would have first qualified for normal retirement if the employee had survived, whichever day is sooner.

(c) The monthly survivor's pension in (b) of this section for survivors of employees who were not peace officers or firefighters is 40 percent of the employee's monthly compensation in the month in which the employee dies. The monthly survivor's pension in (b) of this section for survivors of employees who were peace officers or firefighters is 50 percent of the monthly compensation in the month in which the employee dies. While the monthly survivor's pension is being paid, the survivor is not entitled to elect distributions from the employee's individual contribution account under AS 39.35.810, except as required by AS 39.35.840. While the monthly survivor's pension is being paid, the employer shall make contributions with respect to the employee's surviving spouse and employee's surviving dependent children based on the deceased employee's gross monthly compensation at the time of occupational death

(1) that would have been paid to the employee's individual account under AS 39.35.730 and 39.35.750(a), to the trust account established under AS 39.35.750(e), without deduction from the survivor's pension; and

(2) to the appropriate accounts and funds under AS 39.35.750(b)ยง(e).

(d) If an employee's death is caused by an act of assault, assassination, or terrorism directly related to the person's status as an employee, whether the act occurs on or off the employee's job site, the death shall be considered to have occurred in the performance of and within the scope of the employee's duties for purposes of (a)(2) of this section. If the expressed or apparent motive and intent of the perpetrator of the harm inflicted upon the employee was due to the performance of the employee's job duties or employment, the death shall be considered to be directly related to the employee's status as an employee. An employee's job duties are those performed within the course and scope of the person's employment with an employer.

(e) On the date the employee would have first qualified for normal retirement if the employee had survived, the retirement benefit shall be determined under the provisions of AS 39.35.820ยง39.35.840, 39.35.870, and 39.35.880. In addition to payment of the member's individual account, the surviving spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, the surviving dependent children of the member, shall receive an additional benefit in an amount equal to the accumulated contributions that would have been made to the deceased member's individual account under AS 39.35.730(a) and 39.35.750(a), based on the deceased member's gross monthly compensation at the time of occupational death, from the time of the member's death to the date the member would have first qualified for normal retirement if the member had survived. Earnings shall be allocated to the additional benefit calculated under this subsection based on the actual rate of return, net of expenses, of the trust account established under AS 39.35.750(e) over the period that such contributions would have been made. This additional amount and allocated earnings shall be paid in the same manner as determined for the member's individual account under AS 39.35.820ยง39.35.860 to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Service. An employee who died and whose survivors receive occupational death benefits under this section shall be considered to have retired directly from the plan on the date the employee would have first qualified for normal retirement if the employee had survived. The period of time during which a survivor's pension is paid under this section constitutes membership service for the purpose of determining vesting in employer contributions under AS 39.35.790(b) and eligibility for medical benefits under AS 39.30.300ยง39.30.495 and AS 39.35.700ยง39.35.990.

###### Sec. 39.35.893.   Survivor's pension adjustment.

(a) Once each year, the administrator shall increase payments to a person 60 years of age or older receiving a survivor's pension under AS 39.35.890(k) or 39.35.892(c) and to a person who has received a survivor's pension under AS 39.35.890(k) or 39.35.892(c) for at least five years, who is not otherwise eligible for an increase under this section.

(b) The amount of the increase is a percentage of the current survivor's pension equal to the lesser of 50 percent of the increase in the cost of living in the preceding calendar year or six percent.

(c) If a survivor was not receiving a pension during the entire preceding calendar year, the increase in the survivor's pension under this section shall be adjusted by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months for which the pension was received in the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which is 12.

(d) The administrator shall increase the initial survivor's pension paid to a survivor of a member who died while receiving disability benefits by a percentage equal to the total cumulative percentage that has been applied to the member's disability benefit under AS 39.35.891.

(e) An increase in benefit payments under this section is effective July 1 of each year and is based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers for Anchorage, Alaska, during the previous calendar year, as determined by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

(f) Pension adjustments under this section shall terminate the last day of the month following the date on which a survivor is no longer receiving a survivor's pension under AS 39.35.890(k) or 39.35.892(c).

###### Sec. 39.35.894.   Premiums for retiree major medical insurance coverage upon termination of disability benefits or survivor's pension.

The premium for retiree major medical insurance coverage payable by an employee whose disability benefit is terminated under AS 39.35.890(g) or by an eligible survivor whose survivor pension is terminated under AS 39.35.890(k) or 39.35.892(e) when the employee would have been eligible for normal retirement if the employee had survived shall be determined under AS 39.35.880(g)(2) as if the employee or survivor were eligible for Medicare.

###### Sec. 39.35.895.   Amendment and termination of plan.

(a) The state has the right to amend the plan at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, including the right to make retroactive amendments referred to in 26 U.S.C. 401(b).

(b) The plan administrator may not modify or amend the plan retroactively in such a manner as to reduce the benefits of any member accrued to date under the plan by reason of contributions made before the modification or amendment except to the extent that the reduction is permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.

(c) The state may, in its discretion, terminate the plan in whole or part at any time without liability for the termination. If the plan is terminated, all investments remain in force until all individual accounts have been completely distributed under the plan, and, after all plan liabilities are satisfied, excess assets revert to the employer.

(d) Any contribution made by an employer to the plan because of a mistake of fact must be returned to the employer by the administrator within one year after the contribution or discovery, whichever is later.

###### Sec. 39.35.900.   Exclusive benefit.

(a) The corpus or income of the assets held in trust as required by the plan may not be diverted or used for other than the exclusive benefit of the participants.

(b) If plan benefits are provided through the distribution of annuity or insurance contracts, any refunds or credits in excess of plan benefits due to dividends, earnings, or other experience rating credits, or surrender or cancellation credits, shall be paid to the trust fund.

(c) The assets of the plan may not be used to pay premiums or contributions of the employer under another plan maintained by the employer.

(d) The administrator shall use forfeitures in the fixed benefit account of the plan that arise for any reason, including from termination of employment or death, to reduce employer contributions. Forfeitures may not be applied to increase the benefits of any member.

(e) The administrator shall determine the amount of any fixed benefit that is determined on the basis of actuarial tables using assumptions approved by the commissioner. The amount of benefits is not subject to employer discretion.

###### Sec. 39.35.910.   Nonguarantee of returns, rates, or benefit amounts.

The plan created by AS 39.35.700ยง39.35.990 is, with respect to individual accounts, treated as a defined contribution plan, and not a defined benefit plan. The amount of money in the individual account of a participant depends on the amount of contributions and the rate of return from investments of the account that varies over time. If benefits are paid in the form of an annuity, the benefit amount payable is dependent on the amount of money in the account and the interest rates applied and service fees charged by the annuity payor at the time the annuity is purchased from the carrier and benefits are first paid. Nothing in this plan guarantees a participant

(1) a rate of return or interest rate other than that actually earned by the account of the participant, less applicable administrative expenses; or

(2) an annuity based on interest rates or service charges other than interest rates available from and service charges by the annuity payor in effect at the time the annuity is paid.

###### Sec. 39.35.920.   Nonguarantee of employment.

The provisions of AS 39.35.700ยง39.35.990 are not a contract of employment between an employer and an employee, nor do they confer a right of an employee to be continued in the employment of an employer, nor are they a limitation of the right of an employer to discharge an employee with or without cause.

###### Sec. 39.35.930.   Fraud.

(a) A person who knowingly makes a false statement or falsifies or permits to be falsified a record of this plan in an attempt to defraud the plan is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.

(b) In this section, "knowingly" has the meaning given in AS 11.81.900(a).

###### Sec. 39.35.932.   Pension forfeiture.

The provisions of AS 37.10.310 apply to pension benefits under AS 39.35.700ยง39.35.990.

###### Sec. 39.35.940.   Transfer into defined contribution plan by nonvested members of defined benefit plan.

(a) Subject to (i) of this section, an active member of the defined benefit retirement plan of the public employees' retirement system is eligible to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan established under AS 39.35.700ยง39.35.990 if that member has not vested. Participation in the defined contribution retirement plan is in lieu of participation in the defined benefit retirement plan established under AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680.

(b) A member who has vested in a defined benefit retirement plan is not eligible to transfer under this section.

(c) Each eligible member who elects to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan shall have transferred to a new account the employee contribution account balance held in trust for the member under the defined benefit retirement plan of the public employees' retirement system. A matching employer contribution shall be made on behalf of that employee to the new account. The employer shall make the matching contribution from funds other than the trust funds of the defined benefit retirement plan established under AS 39.35.095ยง39.35.680. The amount of the matching employer contribution shall be subject to, and may not exceed, the limitation of 26 U.S.C. 415(c) during the applicable limitation year as defined by AS 39.35.990. If the matching employer contribution would exceed the limits during the limitation year in which the transfer occurs, the remaining amount of the matching employer contribution shall be made in the next limitation year, if the limits would not be exceeded.

(d) Upon a transfer, all membership service previously earned under the defined benefit retirement plan shall be nullified for purposes of entitlement to a future benefit under the defined benefit retirement plan but shall be credited for purposes of determining vesting in employer contributions under AS 39.35.790(b) and eligibility to elect medical benefits under AS 39.35.870. Membership service allowed for credit toward medical benefits does not include any service credit purchased for employment by an employer who is not a participating employer in this chapter.

(e) An eligible member whose accounts are subject to a qualified domestic relations order may not make an election to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan under this subsection unless the qualified domestic relations order is amended or vacated and court-certified copies of the order are received by the administrator.

(f) As directed by the participant, the board shall transfer or cause to be transferred the appropriate amounts to the designated account. The board shall establish transfer procedures by regulation, but the actual transfer may not be later than 30 days after the effective date of the member's participation in the defined contribution retirement plan unless the major financial markets for securities available for a transfer are seriously disrupted by an unforeseen event that also causes the suspension of trading on any national securities exchange in the country where the securities were issued. In that event, the 30-day period of time may be extended by a resolution of the board of trustees. Transfers are not commissionable or subject to other fees and may be in the form of securities or cash as determined by the board. Securities shall be valued as of the date of receipt in the participant's account.

(g) If the board or the administrator receives notification from the United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, that this section or a portion of this section will cause the retirement system under this chapter, or a portion of the retirement system under this chapter, to be disqualified for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code, the portion that will cause the disqualification does not apply, and the board and the administrator shall notify the presiding officers of the legislature.

(h) An employee who is eligible to elect transfer to the defined contribution retirement plan must make the election not later than 12 months after the first day of the month following the administrator's receipt of the notification that the employee's employer consents to transfers of its employees under (i) of this section. The election to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan must be made in writing on forms and in the manner prescribed by the administrator. Before accepting an election to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan, the administrator must provide the employee planning on making an election to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan with information, including calculations to illustrate the effect of moving the employee's retirement plan from the defined benefit retirement plan to the defined contribution retirement plan as well as other information to clearly inform the employee of the potential consequences of the employee's election. An election made under this subsection to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan is irrevocable. Upon making the election, the participant shall be enrolled as a member of the defined contribution retirement plan, the member's participation in the plan shall be governed by the provisions of AS 39.35.700ยง39.35.990, and the member's participation in the defined benefit retirement plan under AS 39.35.115 shall terminate. The participant's enrollment in the defined contribution retirement plan shall be effective the first day of the month after the administrator receives the completed enrollment forms. An election made by an eligible member who is married is not effective unless the election is signed by the individual's spouse.

(i) A member may make an election under this section only if the member's employer participates in both the defined benefit retirement plan and the defined contribution retirement plan and consents to transfers under this section. The employer shall notify the administrator if the employer consents to allowing the employer's members to choose to transfer from the defined benefit retirement plan to the defined contribution retirement plan under this section. An employer's notice to allow transfers is irrevocable and applicable to all eligible employees of the employer.

A public organization may request to become an employer in this plan. The request shall be made after adoption of a resolution by the governing body of the public organization. A certified copy of the resolution shall be filed with the administrator. If the administrator approves the request for participation, the public organization is an employer of the plan.

###### Sec. 39.35.956.   Contractors and employees of contractors excluded from plan.

(a) A person or legal entity providing services to the state or to a political subdivision or public organization on a contractual or fee basis may not participate as an employer in the plan based on those services.

(b) A person may not participate in the plan as an employee or member as the result of performing work for a person providing services under (a) of this section.

###### Sec. 39.35.957.   Designation of eligible employees, agreement to contribute, and amendment of participation.

(c) An employer may request to amend its participation in the plan to add or exclude departments, groups, or other classifications of employees by filing a resolution as provided by AS 39.35.950 or 39.35.955 with the administrator.

###### Sec. 39.35.958.   Termination of participation in the plan.

(a) A political subdivision or public organization may request that its participation in the plan be terminated. The request may be made only after adoption of a resolution by the legislative body of the political subdivision and approval of the resolution by the person required by law to approve the resolution, or, in the case of a public organization, after adoption of a resolution by the governing body of that public organization. A certified copy of the resolution shall be filed with the administrator.

(b) If contributions are not transmitted to the plan within the prescribed time limit, the administrator may grant an extension and shall assess interest on the outstanding contributions at the rate established under AS 39.35.610.

(c) When an employer's participation in the plan is terminated, or when an employer terminates coverage of a department, group, or other classification of employees under AS 39.35.957(c), the administrator shall assess the employer a termination cost that the administrator determines is actuarially required to fully fund the costs to the plan for employees whose coverage is terminated, including the cost of providing the employer's share of retiree health benefits under AS 39.35.880, occupational disability and occupational death benefits under AS 39.35.890 and 39.35.892, and pension benefits elected under AS 39.35.890(h)(2).

(d) An employee whose coverage under the plan is terminated as a result of termination of an employer's participation under this section or amendment of the employer's agreement under AS 39.35.957(c) shall be considered fully vested in employer contributions under AS 39.35.790(b) and in the individual account established for the employee under AS 39.30.730. If the employee is later employed with a participating employer, the employee's membership service earned under the plan during employment with a terminated employer shall be credited for purposes of determining vesting in employer contributions under AS 39.35.790(b) and eligibility for medical benefits under this chapter and AS 39.30.300ยง39.30.495.

#### Article 1. Declarations.

## Chapter 52. Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act.

###### Sec. 39.52.010.   Declaration of policy.

(a) It is declared that

(1) high moral and ethical standards among public officers in the executive branch are essential to assure the trust, respect, and confidence of the people of this state;

(2) a code of ethics for the guidance of public officers will

(A) discourage those officers from acting upon personal or financial interests in the performance of their public responsibilities;

(B) improve standards of public service; and

(C) promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the people of this state in their public officers;

(3) holding public office or employment is a public trust and that as one safeguard of that trust, the people require public officers to adhere to a code of ethics;

(4) a fair and open government requires that executive branch public officers conduct the public's business in a manner that preserves the integrity of the governmental process and avoids conflicts of interest;

(5) in order for the rules governing conduct to be respected both during and after leaving public service, the code of ethics must be administered fairly without bias or favoritism;

(6) no code of conduct, however comprehensive, can anticipate all situations in which violations may occur nor can it prescribe behaviors that are appropriate to every situation; in addition, laws and regulations regarding ethical responsibilities cannot legislate morality, eradicate corruption, or eliminate bad judgment; and

(7) compliance with a code of ethics is an individual responsibility; thus all who serve the state have a solemn responsibility to avoid improper conduct and prevent improper behavior by colleagues and subordinates.

(b) The legislature declares that it is the policy of the state, when a public employee is appointed to serve on a state board or commission, that the holding of such offices does not constitute the holding of incompatible offices unless expressly prohibited by the Alaska Constitution, this chapter and any opinions or decisions rendered under it, or another statute.

#### Article 2. Code of Ethics.

###### Sec. 39.52.110.   Scope of code; prohibition of unethical conduct.

(a) The legislature reaffirms that each public officer holds office as a public trust, and any effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action is a violation of that trust.  In addition, the legislature finds that, so long as it does not interfere with the full and faithful discharge of an officer's public duties and responsibilities, this chapter does not prevent an officer from following other independent pursuits.  The legislature further recognizes that

(1) in a representative democracy, the representatives are drawn from society and, therefore, cannot and should not be without personal and financial interests in the decisions and policies of government;

(2) people who serve as public officers retain their rights to interests of a personal or financial nature; and

(3) standards of ethical conduct for members of the executive branch need to distinguish between those minor and inconsequential conflicts that are unavoidable in a free society, and those conflicts of interests that are substantial and material.

(b) Unethical conduct is prohibited, but there is no substantial impropriety if, as to a specific matter, a public officer's

(1) personal or financial interest in the matter is insignificant, or of a type that is possessed generally by the public or a large class of persons to which the public officer belongs; or

(2) action or influence would have insignificant or conjectural effect on the matter.

(c) The attorney general, designated supervisors, hearing officers, and the personnel board must be guided by this section when issuing opinions and reaching decisions.

(d) Stock or other ownership interest in a business is presumed insignificant if the value of the stock or other ownership interest, including an option to purchase an ownership interest, is less than $5,000.

###### Sec. 39.52.120.   Misuse of official position.

(a) A public officer may not use, or attempt to use, an official position for personal gain, and may not intentionally secure or grant unwarranted benefits or treatment for any person.

(b) A public officer may not

(1) seek other employment or contracts through the use or attempted use of official position;

(2) accept, receive, or solicit compensation for the performance of official duties or responsibilities from a person other than the state;

(3) use state time, property, equipment, or other facilities to benefit personal or financial interests;

(4) take or withhold official action in order to affect a matter in which the public officer has a personal or financial interest;

(5) attempt to benefit a personal or financial interest through coercion of a subordinate or require another public officer to perform services for the private benefit of the public officer at any time; or

(6) use or authorize the use of state funds, facilities, equipment, services, or another government asset or resource for partisan political purposes; this paragraph does not prohibit use of the governor's residence for meetings to discuss political strategy and does not prohibit use of state aircraft or the communications equipment in the governor's residence so long as there is no charge to the state for the use; in this paragraph, "for partisan political purposes"

(A) means having the intent to differentially benefit or harm a

(i) candidate or potential candidate for elective office; or

(ii) political party or group;

(B) but does not include having the intent to benefit the public interest at large through the normal performance of official duties.

(c) In addition to other provisions of this section, a public officer who is a member of the Board of Fisheries or the Board of Game may not act on a matter before the board if the public officer has not disclosed in the manner set out in AS 39.52.220 all personal or financial interests in a business or organization relating to fish or game resources.

(d) In this section, when determining whether a public officer is considered to be performing a task on government time, the attorney general and personnel board shall consider the public officer's work schedule as set by the public officer's immediate supervisor, if any. A public officer other than the governor and lieutenant governor who, during the work days, engages in political campaign activities other than minor, inconsequential, and unavoidable campaign activities shall take approved leave for the period of campaigning.

(e) Except for supplying information requested by the hearing officer or the entity with authority to make the final decision in the case, or when responding to contacts initiated by the hearing officer or the individual, board, or commission with authority to make the final decision in the case, a public officer may not attempt to influence the outcome of an administrative hearing by directly or indirectly contacting or attempting to contact the hearing officer or individual, board, or commission with authority to make the final decision in the case assigned to the hearing officer unless the

(1) contact is made in the presence of all parties to the hearing or the parties' representatives and the contact is made a part of the record; or

(2) fact and substance of the contact is promptly disclosed by the public officer to all parties to the hearing and the contact is made a part of the record.

(f) Use of state aircraft for partisan political purposes is permitted under (b) of this section only when the use is collateral or incidental to the normal performance of official duties and does not exceed 10 percent of the total of the use of the aircraft for official purposes and partisan political purposes, combined, on a single trip. A public officer who authorizes or makes any partisan political use of a state aircraft under (b) of this section shall disclose the authorization and use under AS 39.52.210 or 39.52.220 for each trip, and the person who uses the aircraft shall reimburse the state for the proportionate share of the actual cost of the use.

###### Sec. 39.52.130.   Improper gifts.

(a) A public officer may not solicit, accept, or receive, directly or indirectly, a gift, whether in the form of money, service, loan, travel, entertainment, hospitality, employment, promise, or in any other form, that is a benefit to the officer's personal or financial interests, under circumstances in which it could reasonably be inferred that the gift is intended to influence the performance of official duties, actions, or judgment. A gift from a person required to register as a lobbyist under AS 24.45.041 to a public officer or a public officer's immediate family member is presumed to be intended to influence the performance of official duties, actions, or judgment unless the giver is an immediate family member of the person receiving the gift.

(b) Notice of the receipt by a public officer of a gift with a value in excess of $150, including the name of the giver and a description of the gift and its approximate value, must be provided to the designated supervisor within 30 days after the date of its receipt

(1) if the public officer may take or withhold official action that affects the giver; or

(2) if the gift is connected to the public officer's governmental status.

(c) In accordance with AS 39.52.240, a designated supervisor may request guidance from the attorney general concerning whether acceptance of a particular gift is prohibited.

(d) The restrictions relating to gifts imposed by this section do not apply to a campaign contribution to a candidate for elective office if the contribution complies with laws and regulations governing elections and campaign disclosure.

(e) A public officer who, on behalf of the state, accepts a gift from another government or from an official of another government shall, within 60 days after its receipt, notify the Office of the Governor in writing. The Office of the Governor shall determine the appropriate disposition of the gift.
