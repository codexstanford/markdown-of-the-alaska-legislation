(1) if the harvestable portion of the stock or population is sufficient to provide for all consumptive uses, the appropriate board

(A) shall adopt regulations that provide a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses of those stocks or populations;

(B) shall adopt regulations that provide for other uses of those stocks or populations, subject to preferences among beneficial uses; and

(C) may adopt regulations to differentiate among uses;

(2) if the harvestable portion of the stock or population is sufficient to provide for subsistence uses and some, but not all, other consumptive uses, the appropriate board

(A) shall adopt regulations that provide a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses of those stocks or populations;

(B) may adopt regulations that provide for other consumptive uses of those stocks or populations; and

(C) shall adopt regulations to differentiate among consumptive uses that provide for a preference for the subsistence uses, if regulations are adopted under (B) of this paragraph;

(3) if the harvestable portion of the stock or population is sufficient to provide for subsistence uses, but no other consumptive uses, the appropriate board shall

(A) determine the portion of the stocks or populations that can be harvested consistent with sustained yield; and

(B) adopt regulations that eliminate other consumptive uses in order to provide a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses; and

(4) if the harvestable portion of the stock or population is not sufficient to provide a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses, the appropriate board shall

(A) adopt regulations eliminating consumptive uses, other than subsistence uses;

(B) distinguish among subsistence users, through limitations based on

###### Sec. 16.05.331.   Elk farming. [Renumbered as AS 16.40.050.]

###### Sec. 16.05.332.   Wildlife Violator Compact.

The Wildlife Violator Compact as contained in this section is enacted into law and entered into on behalf of the State of Alaska with any other states legally joining it in a form substantially as follows:

Section 1. Findings. The party states find that

(a) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.

(b) The protection of their respective wildlife resources are materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule relating to the management of those resources.

(c) The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of those natural resources.

(d) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries and, therefore, all persons must be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration statutes, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations of all party states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife.

(e) The violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property.

(f) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communications among the various states.

(g) In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person's home state

(1) must post collateral or a bond to secure the person's appearance for a trial at a later date;

(2)  if unable to post collateral or a bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or

(3) is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.

(h) The purpose of the enforcement practices described in (g) of this section is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the person's way after receiving the citation, could return to the person's home state and disregard the person's duty under the terms of the citation.

(i)  In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person's home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and continue immediately on the person's way after agreeing to comply with the terms of the citation.

(j) The practice described in (g) of this section causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay a fine and, therefore, is compelled to remain in custody until another arrangement is made.

(k) The enforcement practices described in (g) of this section consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.

Sec. 2. Policies. The policies of the party states are to

(a) Promote compliance with the statutes, ordinances, regulations and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states.

(b) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a party state and treat the suspension as if it had occurred in their state.

(c) Allow a violator to accept a wildlife citation, except as provided in subsection (b) of article III, and proceed on the person's way without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued if the person's home state is a party to this compact.

(d) Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state.

(e) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for its residents which occurred in another party state as if they had occurred in the home state.

(f) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state.

(g) Maximize the effective use of law enforcement personnel and information.

(h) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.

Sec. 3. Purposes. The purposes of this compact are to:

(a) Provide a means by which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to carry out the policies set forth in section 2 of this article in a uniform and orderly manner.

(b) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within party states in recognition of the persons' right of due process in the sovereign status of a party state.

As used in this compact, unless the context otherwise requires,

(a) "Citation" means any summons, complaint, summons and complaint, ticket, penalty assessment or other official document issued by a wildlife officer or other peace officer for a wildlife violation containing an order that requires the person to respond.

(b) "Collateral" means any cash or other security deposited to secure an appearance for trial in connection with the issuance by a wildlife officer or other peace officer of a citation for a wildlife violation.

(c) "Compliance" means the act of answering a citation by appearing in a court or tribunal or the payment of fines, costs, or surcharges, if any.

(d) "Conviction" means a conviction, including any court conviction, of any offense related to the preservation, protection, management, or restoration of wildlife which is prohibited by state statute, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule, or a forfeiture of bail, bond, or other security deposited to secure the appearance of a person charged with any such offense, or the payment of a penalty assessment or a plea of nolo contendere, or the imposition of a deferred or suspended sentence by the court.

(e) "Court" means a court of law, including magistrate's court and the justice of the peace court.

(f) "Home state" means the state of primary residence of a person.

(g) "Issuing state" means the party state that issues a wildlife citation.

#### Article 4. Utilization of Pollock and Herring.

###### Sec. 16.10.164.   Policy on utilization of pollock.

The legislature declares that stripping roe from pollock without utilizing the flesh is wasteful and does not constitute utilization of this resource for the maximum benefit of the people.  Therefore, it is the policy of the state that

(1) roe stripping be eliminated to the fullest extent possible; and

(2) pollock taken in a commercial fishery should be utilized for human consumption to the fullest extent practicable.

The legislature finds the following: (1) extensive and valuable herring populations are available for harvest in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the state; (2) commercial markets are available for herring processed in several forms; (3) one processing technique presently employed involves deliberately permitting decomposition of the herring carcass to allow for removal and subsequent sale of the roe product, with the consequence that the flesh is unusable and discarded.  The legislature declares that the process referred to in (3) of this section is wasteful and does not constitute utilization of this resource for the maximum benefit of the people. Therefore, it is the policy of the legislature that this process should be eliminated to the fullest extent possible.

Normal, inadvertent loss of flesh associated with the uses described in this subsection that cannot be prevented by practical means does not constitute waste.  The commissioner may authorize other uses of commercially taken herring consistent with the intent of this section and AS 16.10.172 upon receipt of a request accompanied by a detailed justification.

(e) A person who violates this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.

(a) A person may not remove herring from the state before the herring has been frozen or otherwise processed for shipment.

(b) In this section, "processed for shipment" includes, but is not limited to, icing, stripping, or salting of the herring; however, it does not include salting of the herring if five percent or more of the body weight of the herring consists of roe.

#### Article 12. High Seas Interception of Salmon.

###### Sec. 16.10.750.   Findings and purpose.

(a) The legislature finds that

(1) the salmon fishing industry is among the state's largest industries and generates hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of jobs each year; the salmon fishery is vitally important to commercial, subsistence, personal use, and sport fishing interests, and to the state's developing tourist industry;

(2) the state is committed to maintaining and enhancing its wild stocks of salmon by careful management, by initiating a 20-year rebuilding program, and by investing in the fishing industry;

(3) millions of Alaska salmon are being caught and injured by high seas fisheries that intercept salmon contrary to state, federal, or international law; the high seas interception of Alaska salmon defeats the state's management and rebuilding programs, deprives the state of a return on its investment in the fishing industry, and detrimentally affects subsistence and sport fishing uses of Alaska salmon;

(4) vessels that engage in the high seas interception of salmon can move relatively freely and undetected from region to region in the North Pacific and thus are able to harvest whatever species is most readily available or most valuable; by moving farther westward, a greater proportion of the take is Asian salmon; moving eastward results in a greater proportion of the take being Alaska salmon; although there is intermixing of Asian and North American salmon stocks, scientific evidence proves that even a minimal harvest of salmon within the migratory range of each species will contain Alaska salmon;

(5) the illegal taking of salmon detrimentally affects the Alaska fishing industry; the illegal taking of Alaska salmon is of primary concern because of the direct and immediate effect on the state; in addition, the illegal taking of Asian salmon is also of concern because depletion of those stocks will ultimately result in a shifting of high seas fishing efforts, both legal and illegal, to Alaska salmon;

(6) high seas interception of salmon occurs beyond the exclusive economic zone of the United States, or through incursion within the exclusive economic zone and the state's territorial sea, by vessels that are usually not registered in this state; moreover, these vessels are not based in Alaska and can thus avoid detection more easily than Alaska-based vessels; as a practical matter, it is extremely difficult to directly or indirectly regulate the vessels themselves; it is therefore necessary to prohibit activities within the state that give aid, comfort, and financial incentives to high seas interception of salmon.

(b) The purpose of  AS 16.10.750§ 16.10.800 is to prevent resources, facilities, and expertise within the state from being available to promote or facilitate the high seas interception of salmon or the making of intercepted salmon ready for or accessible to world markets.

###### Sec. 16.10.760.   Trafficking in intercepted salmon.

(a) A person commits the offense of trafficking in intercepted salmon if the person

(1) buys, sells, trades, processes, or possesses salmon, or attempts to buy, sell, trade, process, or possess salmon, with reckless disregard that the salmon has been, or will be, obtained by high seas interception;

(2) knowingly provides financing, premises, equipment, supplies, services, power, or fuel used to buy, sell, trade, process, or possess salmon that has been, or will be, obtained by high seas interception; or

(3) acts as a broker or middleman, or otherwise acts on behalf of another party, to arrange for or negotiate, or attempts to arrange for or negotiate, the purchase, sale, trade, processing, or possession of salmon, with reckless disregard that the salmon has been, or will be, obtained by high seas interception.

(b) Trafficking in intercepted salmon is a class C felony.

###### Sec. 16.10.770.   Falsification related to high seas interception of salmon.

(a) A person commits the offense of falsification related to high seas interception of salmon if the person creates, utters, or possesses a written instrument related to salmon, or makes an assertion for the purpose of having a written instrument related to salmon created, uttered, or accepted, with reckless disregard that the salmon was obtained by high seas interception and that the written instrument or assertion conveys misleading or untrue information about the ownership, possession, processing, origin, destination, route of shipping, type, condition, or time, place, and manner of the taking of the salmon.

(b) In this section

(1) "utter" has the meaning given in AS 11.46.580(b);

(2) "written instrument" has the meaning given in AS 11.46.580(b) and includes ships' logs and papers, bills of lading and sale, documents relating to processing, shipping, and customs, and information stamped on or affixed to cans, crates, containers, freight, or a means of storage or packaging.

###### Sec. 16.10.780.   Assisting a vessel in high seas interception of salmon.

(a) A person commits the offense of assisting a vessel in high seas interception of salmon if, knowing that a vessel is in possession of salmon obtained by high seas interception or that the owner or operator of the vessel intends to engage in the imminent interception of salmon, the person

(1) moves persons, cargo, or other property to or from the vessel;

(2) services or repairs the vessel or its equipment;

(3) provides the vessel with power, supplies, equipment, or fuel;

(4) provides the vessel with information, other than weather reports, capable of aiding the high seas interception of salmon or frustrating or avoiding detection, including communicating the movements, intentions, or activities of state or federal law enforcement officials or other fishing vessels; or

(5) is in charge of a docking facility, harbor, or anchorage, and permits the vessel to dock or anchor, or to remain docked or anchored.

(b) It is an affirmative defense, as defined in AS 11.81.900(b), to a violation of this section, if the person honestly and reasonably believed that the assistance provided to the vessel was necessary for humanitarian or environmental purposes or to prevent a significant loss of property. An affirmative defense under this section may not be raised, unless the person provided immediate notice, by the quickest available means, to the United States Coast Guard or the Department of Public Safety indicating the type of assistance being provided and the circumstances requiring the assistance.

(b) A permit holder shall ensure that shellfish harvested and sold for human consumption are of comparable quality to shellfish harvested by commercial fisheries in the area and are sold at prices commensurate with the current market.

###### Sec. 16.12.090.   Cost recovery fisheries.

(a) A permit holder may harvest shellfish for a project under AS 16.12.010 in a special harvest area through

(1) agents or employees of or persons under contract with the permit holder as provided under a permit from the department or regulations of the Board of Fisheries; or

(2) the common property fishery under this section.

(b) A permit holder may, by a majority vote of the membership of the permit holder's board of directors, elect to harvest shellfish in a special harvest area established for a project under AS 16.12.010 through the common property fishery. A permit holder seeking to harvest shellfish in a special harvest area through a common property fishery shall notify the Department of Revenue by July 1 of the year preceding the year for which the harvest is sought. At the request of the permit holder and if the commissioner determines that there are no allocative issues involved, and after reasonable consultation with affected commercial fishermen, the commissioner may adopt regulations governing the harvest of shellfish in a special harvest area through a common property fishery. The regulations must specify the terms, conditions, and rules under which the common property fishery in the special harvest area shall be conducted, including requirements for holding inspections and reporting of harvests and sales of shellfish taken in the special harvest area. Following adoption of regulations by the department, before January 15 of each year, the permit holder's board, by a majority vote of the board's membership, may determine whether the permit holder will operate under the regulations adopted under this subsection during the current calendar year and shall notify the department if the permit holder intends to operate under the regulations adopted under this subsection. The Board of Fisheries may adopt regulations under AS 16.05.251 regarding a fisheries management plan governing operations under this subsection in a special harvest area, including allocation plans. Participation in the fishery must be open to all interim-use permit and entry permit holders who hold permits to operate a type of gear that may be used in the fishing district in which the special harvest area is located if that type of gear is authorized by regulation to be used in the special harvest area. An interim-use permit holder or an entry permit holder who takes shellfish in a common property fishery in a special harvest area may sell the shellfish to a fish buyer or processor who is licensed to do business in the state.

(c) As a condition of participation in a common property shellfish fishery in a special harvest area under this section, a commercial fisherman who participates in the fishery is subject to the payment of the assessment levied under (d) of this section on the projected value of the shellfish or on the pounds of shellfish harvested. The assessment is levied on the shellfish that the commercial fisherman takes in the special harvest area and sells to a licensed buyer. The buyer of the shellfish must be licensed under AS 43.75, and the buyer shall collect the assessment on shellfish taken in a special harvest area at the time of purchase and remit the assessment to the Department of Revenue in accordance with regulations adopted by the Department of Revenue.

(d) The Department of Revenue may, by regulation, set the assessment levied on shellfish taken in a special harvest area on an annual basis in consultation with the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development, the permit holder, and representatives of affected commercial fishermen. The Department of Revenue shall set an annual assessment under this section not later than January 1 of that year. The assessment must provide sufficient revenue to cover debt service, reasonable operating expenses, reasonable maintenance expenses, and development or maintenance of a reserve fund up to 100 percent of annual operating costs of the permit holder's project under AS 16.12.010. In setting the assessment, the Department of Revenue shall consider the estimated harvest of shellfish in the special harvest area, the projected price to be paid for shellfish in the region, the amount of the existing reserve held by the permit holder, and the amount by which the assessment collected in previous years exceeded or fell short of the amount anticipated to be collected. The assessment may not exceed 50 percent of the value of the shellfish. The Department of Revenue may levy the assessment as a percentage of the projected value of the shellfish harvested in the special harvest area or as a flat rate on each pound of shellfish harvested in the area, to the nearest whole cent.

(e) The Department of Revenue shall deposit the assessments collected under this section in the general fund. The legislature may appropriate the funds collected under this section to the permit holder who is carrying out a project under AS 16.12.010, including the operation of a facility, in the special harvest area in which the assessment was levied. A permit holder shall use funds appropriated under this subsection for the purposes set out under AS 16.12.080(a). The legislature may also appropriate funds collected under this section to the Department of Revenue for costs incurred by the Department of Revenue under this section.

(f) A person who violates a regulation adopted under (b) of this section is guilty of a violation under AS 16.05.722 or a misdemeanor under AS 16.05.723. A person who violates a regulation adopted by the Department of Revenue under (c) of this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.

(1) intends to exhibit the animal commercially;

(2) possesses facilities to maintain the animal under positive control and humane conditions; and

(3) maintains personal injury and property damage insurance in an amount established by the commissioner.

#### Article 2. Aquatic Farming.

###### Sec. 16.40.100.   Aquatic farm and hatchery permits.

(a) A person may not, without a permit from the commissioner, construct or operate

(1) an aquatic farm; or

(2) a hatchery for the purpose of supplying aquatic plants or shellfish to an aquatic farm.

(b) A permit issued under this section authorizes the permittee, subject to the conditions of AS 16.40.100§16.40.199 and AS 17.20, to

(1) acquire, purchase, offer to purchase, transfer, possess, sell, and offer to sell stock and aquatic farm products that are used or reared at the hatchery or aquatic farm; and

(2) except as provided in (f) of this section, harvest and, without further cultivation, sell an insignificant population that may be present at the aquatic farm site of a wild stock of a shellfish species intended to be cultured at the site.

(c) The commissioner may attach conditions to a permit issued under this section that are necessary to protect natural fish and wildlife resources.

(d) Notwithstanding other provisions of law, the commissioner may not issue a permit under this section for the farming of, or hatchery operations involving, Atlantic salmon.

(e) Upon the expiration or termination of a permit issued under this section, a person who holds a permit for an aquatic farming site where wild stocks of shellfish indigenous to the site are cultured shall, as a condition of the permit, restore the wild stock of shellfish, as consistent with sustained yield management of the wild stock, to the population level that existed on the site when the permit for the site was initially issued by the commissioner. A permit holder is not required to restore that portion of the wild stock of shellfish that was removed from an aquatic farming site by a common property fishery conducted after the issuance of the permit for the aquatic farming site.

(f) If the wild stock of a shellfish species to be cultured at an aquatic farm site exceeds the amount determined by the department to be an insignificant population and if the commissioner determines in writing that removal from the site of that portion of the stock that exceeds an insignificant population would benefit the public and that removal of the stock by a person other than the permittee would unreasonably interfere with the operation of the aquatic farm, the commissioner may authorize the permittee to remove and sell the excess amount of the wild stock from the site, if the permittee pays reasonable compensation, as defined by the department, to the department for the harvest and sale of the excess wild stock. The department shall deposit the money received under this subsection into the general fund. The legislature may appropriate the money received under this section to the department for shellfish management and enhancement.

(g) The commissioner may not use the absence of wild geoduck stock within a management area described in AS 16.40.145 as the reason for denial of an aquatic farm permit under this section. If, under this section, the commissioner issues a permit for an aquatic farm to culture geoducks in a management area that does not have wild geoduck stocks when the permit is issued, the permit may not allow operations for that purpose in the intertidal habitat or environment.

###### Sec. 16.40.105.   Criteria for issuance of permits.

The commissioner shall issue permits under AS 16.40.100 on the basis of the following criteria:

(1) the physical and biological characteristics of the proposed farm or hatchery location must be suitable for the farming or the shellfish or aquatic plant proposed;

(2) the proposed farm or hatchery may not require significant alterations in traditional fisheries or other existing uses of fish and wildlife resources;

(3) the proposed farm or hatchery may not significantly affect fisheries, wildlife, or their habitats in an adverse manner;

(4) the proposed farm or hatchery plans and staffing plans must demonstrate technical and operational feasibility; and

(5) the proposed farm site may not include more than an insignificant population of a wild stock, on the site, of a shellfish species intended to be cultured.

###### Sec. 16.40.110.   Permit application, renewal, and transfer.

(a) An applicant for an aquatic farming or hatchery permit required under AS 16.40.100 shall apply on a form prescribed by the commissioner. An application for a permit must include a plan for the development and operation of the aquatic farm or hatchery, which must be approved by the commissioner before the permit is issued.

(b) An application for renewal or transfer of a permit must be accompanied by fees required by the commissioner, a report of the disease history of the farm or hatchery covered by the permit, and evidence that satisfies the commissioner that the applicant has complied with the development plan required under (a) of this section. The commissioner may require a health inspection of the farm or hatchery as a condition of renewal. The department may conduct the inspection or contract with a disease diagnostician to conduct the inspection.

(c) A person to whom a permit is transferred may use the permit only for the purposes for which the permit was authorized to be used by the transferor, and subject to the same conditions and limitations.

###### Sec. 16.40.120.   Aquatic stock acquisition permits.

(a) A person may not acquire aquatic plants or shellfish from wild stock in the state for the purpose of supplying stock to an aquatic farm or hatchery required to have a permit under AS 16.40.100 unless the person holds an acquisition permit from the commissioner.

(b) An acquisition permit authorizes the permit holder to acquire the species and quantities of wild stock in the state specified in the permit for the purposes of supplying stock to

(1) an aquatic farm or hatchery required to have a permit under AS 16.40.100;

(2) the department.

(c) The commissioner shall specify the expiration date of an acquisition permit and may attach conditions to an acquisition permit, including conditions relating to the time, place, and manner of harvest. Size, gear, place, time, licensing, and other limitations applicable to sport, commercial, or subsistence harvest of aquatic plants and shellfish do not apply to a harvest with a permit issued under this section. The commissioner of fish and game shall issue or deny a permit within 30 days after receiving an application.

(d) The commissioner shall deny or restrict a permit under this section upon finding that the proposed harvest will impair sustained yield of the species or will unreasonably disrupt established uses of the resources by commercial, sport, personal use, or subsistence users. The commissioner shall inform the Board of Fisheries of any action taken on permit applications for species that support commercial fisheries subject to limited entry under AS 16.43 and of any permits denied because of unreasonable disruption of an established use. A denial of the permit by the commissioner must contain the factual basis for the findings.

(e) The Board of Fisheries may adopt regulations for the conservation, maintenance, and management of species for which an acquisition permit is required.

(f) Except as provided in (d) of this section or in a regulation adopted under (e) of this section, the commissioner shall issue a permit if

(1) wild stock is necessary to meet the initial needs of farm or hatchery stock;

(2) there are technological limitations on the propagation of culture stock for the species sought;

(3) wild stock sought is not fully utilized by commercial, sport, personal use, or subsistence fisheries; or

(4) wild stock is needed to maintain the gene pool of a hatchery or aquatic farm.

(a) A private hatchery required to have a permit under AS 16.40.100 may sell or transfer stock from the hatchery only to an aquatic farm or other hatchery that has a permit issued under AS 16.40.100, except that shellfish stock may also be sold or offered for sale to an aquatic farm or related hatchery outside of the state.

(b) Stock may not be transferred to or from an aquatic farm or hatchery required to have a permit under AS 16.40.100 without prior notice of the transfer to the commissioner. A notice of transfer shall be submitted at least 45 days before the proposed date of transfer.

(c) A notice of transfer must be accompanied by a report of a health inspection of the stock. The department shall conduct the inspection or contract with a disease diagnostician to conduct the inspection. The cost of inspection shall be borne by the department.

(d) The department may restrict or disapprove a transfer of stock if it finds that the transfer would present a risk of spreading disease.

(e) A person may not sell, transfer, or offer to sell or transfer, or knowingly purchase or receive, an aquatic farm product grown or propagated in the state unless the product was grown or propagated on a farm with a permit issued under AS 16.40.100.

If no spouse survives and if the person designated on the form, if any, does not survive, the permit passes as part of the permit holder's estate. A designation under this subsection must be acknowledged before a person authorized to administer an oath under AS 09.63.010 or must be witnessed by two persons who are qualified under AS 13.12.505 to witness the will of the permit holder. Except as provided in AS 16.10.333§16.10.337, AS 44.81.215, and 44.81.231§44.81.250, the permit is exempt from the claims of creditors of the estate.

(a) Except as specifically provided in this section, the commission shall establish annual fees for the issuance and annual renewal of entry permits or interim-use permits.

(b) The commission may charge interest at a rate not to exceed the legal rate of interest established in AS 45.45.010 on fees more than 60 days overdue.

(c) The annual base fee for issuance or renewal of an entry permit or an interim-use permit may not be less than $30 or more than $3,000. The annual base fee must reasonably reflect the different rates of economic return for different fisheries. In addition to the annual base fee established by the commission under this subsection, a nonresident shall pay an annual nonresident surcharge for the issuance or renewal of one or more entry permits or interim-use permits. The commission shall establish the annual nonresident surcharge by regulation at an amount that is as close as is practicable to the maximum allowed by law.

(d) The holder of a permit whose household income, assets, and financial resources fall within the eligibility standards for the food stamp program under 7 U.S.C. 2011§2025, as amended, is subject to an annual base fee for the issuance or renewal of an entry permit or an interim-use permit that is equal to 50 percent of the annual base fee that the permit holder would otherwise pay under (c) of this section. In addition to the reduced annual base fee under this subsection, a nonresident who qualifies for a reduced fee under this subsection shall pay the annual nonresident surcharge established under (c) of this section.

###### Sec. 16.43.170.   Transfer of entry permits.

(a) Except as provided in AS 16.10.333§16.10.338 and in AS 44.81.231§44.81.250, entry permits and interim-use permits are transferable only through the commission as provided in this section and AS 16.43.180 and under regulations adopted by the commission. An involuntary transfer of an entry permit in a manner inconsistent with the statutes of this state and the regulations of the commission is void.

(b) Except as provided in (e) of this section, the holder of an entry permit may transfer the permit to another person or to the commission upon 60 days notice of intent to transfer under regulations adopted by the commission. No sooner than 60 days nor later than 12 months from the date of notice to the commission, the holder of an entry permit may transfer the permit. If the proposed transferee, other than the commission, can demonstrate the present ability to participate actively in the fishery and the transfer does not violate any provision of this chapter or regulations adopted under this chapter, and if a certificate for the permit under AS 16.10.333(b)(1)§(2), 16.10.338, or AS 44.81.231(a) is not in effect, the commission shall approve the transfer and reissue the entry permit to the transferee provided that neither party is prohibited by law from participating in the transfer.

(c)  [Repealed,§10 ch 135 SLA 2002.]

(d)  [Repealed,§9 ch 73 SLA 1977.]

(e) The holder of an entry permit who qualified for that entry permit in a priority classification designated under AS 16.43.250(c) may not transfer that permit.

(f) The permanent transfer of an entry permit is void if proceedings in which commercial fishing privileges and licenses may be suspended under AS 16.05.710 are pending against the permit holder at the time of transfer unless the transfer of the entry permit is allowed by order of the court in which the proceedings are pending.

(g) A person may request the commission to transfer an entry permit due to an execution on a permit holder's interest in that permit if the execution is to enforce a lien recorded with the commission under AS 25.27.230(c). The request shall be made in the form and manner provided in this chapter and regulations adopted under this chapter. The commission may deny a request for transfer of an entry permit due to an execution of a holder's interest in that permit if

(1) the execution does not comply with legal requirements or otherwise is not valid;

(2) the transfer violates this chapter or regulations adopted under this chapter;

(3) the proposed transferee or other party to the transfer is prohibited by law from participating in the transaction;

(4) a certificate for the permit under AS 16.10.333(b)(1)§(2), 16.10.338, or AS 44.81.231(a) is in effect at the time of the proposed transfer;

(5) the proposed transferee of the entry permit, other than the commission, cannot demonstrate the present ability to actively participate in the fishery; or

(6) the holder of the entry permit as shown by the records of the commission demonstrates, under regulations adopted by the commission, that the entry permit is a necessary means of support for the holder and those dependent upon the holder.

(h) Notwithstanding (g) of this section, the commission may not approve a request for transfer of an entry permit after an execution sale unless the parties to the transfer offer the commission a right to purchase the permit at the same price and on the same terms as those of that execution sale. If the commission exercises its right to purchase the permit, the permit then shall be transferred to the commission.

###### Sec. 16.43.180.   Emergency transfers.

(a) The commission shall adopt regulations providing for the temporary emergency transfer of entry permits and interim-use permits when illness, disability, death, required military or government service, or other unavoidable hardship prevents the permit holder from participating in the fishery. To alleviate hardship pending a final determination of the permit holder's eligibility for an entry permit, the commission shall adopt regulations providing for the temporary emergency transfer of an interim-use permit issued under AS 16.43.210(b) or 16.43.225.

(b) The commission shall adopt regulations providing for the temporary transfer of an entry permit upon the death of the permittee pending final disposition of the permit as a part of the permittee's estate.

#### Article 3. Initial Issuance of Entry Permits.

###### Sec. 16.43.200.   Administrative areas.

(a) The commission shall establish administrative areas suitable for regulating and controlling entry into the commercial fisheries.  The commission shall make the administrative areas reasonably compatible with the geographic areas for which specific commercial fishing regulations are adopted by the Board of Fisheries.

(b) The commission may modify or change the boundaries of administrative areas when necessary and consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

###### Sec. 16.43.210.   Interim-use permit; qualifications.

(a) For each fishery that is not subject to a maximum number of entry permits under AS 16.43.240 and not subject to a moratorium under AS 16.43.225, the commission shall issue interim-use permits under regulations adopted by the commission to all applicants who can establish their present ability to participate actively in the fishery for which they are making application.

(b) Before the issuance of the maximum number of entry permits for a given fishery, the commission may issue an interim-use permit to an applicant who may later become eligible for an entry permit under AS 16.43.270.

(c) To the extent that the commissioner of fish and game authorizes it under AS 16.05.050(a)(9), the commission may grant an interim-use permit to a person to engage in the commercial taking from a fishery on an experimental basis.

(d) The sustained yield management and economic health of the following fisheries is severely impaired as a result, among other factors, of too many units of gear participating in the commercial harvest:

(1) Bristol Bay registration area § drift gillnet fishery;

(2) Cook Inlet registration area § drift gillnet fishery;

(3) Prince William Sound registration area § drift gillnet fishery.

(e)  [Repealed,§69 ch 6 SLA 1984.]

###### Sec. 16.43.220.   Terms and conditions of interim-use permits.

(a) The commission shall adopt regulations specifying the dates and places of application, the procedures to be followed in renewal of the interim-use permit including the time, place of its renewal, and for any other purpose incident to the administration of interim-use permits for that fishery.  An interim-use permit shall expire upon the final determination of the holder's eligibility for an entry permit.

(b)  [Repealed,§9 ch 73 SLA 1977.]

(c) The holder of an interim-use permit shall have the permit in possession at all times when engaged in the operation of the gear for which it was issued.

###### Sec. 16.43.225.   Moratorium on new entrants into certain fisheries.

(a) Subject to (b) of this section, the commission may establish a moratorium on new entrants into a fishery

(1) that has experienced recent increases in fishing effort that are beyond a low, sporadic level of effort;

(2) that has achieved a level of harvest that may be approaching or exceeding the maximum sustainable level for the fishery; and

(3) for which there is insufficient biological and resource management information necessary to promote the conservation and sustained yield management of the fishery.

(b) The commission may establish a moratorium on new entrants into a fishery described in (a) of this section if

(1) the commissioner of fish and game, subject to AS 16.05.251(g), petitions the commission under AS 44.62.220 to establish a moratorium on new entrants into the fishery; and

(2) the commission finds that

(A) the fishery has reached a level of participation that may threaten the conservation and the sustained yield management of the fishery resource and the economic health and stability of commercial fishing; and

(B) the commission has insufficient information to conclude that the establishment of a maximum number of entry permits under AS 16.43.240 would further the purposes of this chapter.

(c) The commission may establish a moratorium under this section for a continuous period of up to four years. A fishery that has been subject to a moratorium under this section may not be subjected to a subsequent moratorium under this section unless five years have elapsed since the previous moratorium expired.

(d) While a moratorium is in effect, the commission shall conduct investigations to determine whether a maximum number of entry permits should be established under AS 16.43.240 by

(1) conducting research into conditions in the fishery;

(2) consulting with the Department of Fish and Game and the Board of Fisheries; and

(3) consulting with participants in the fishery.

(e) The commission shall establish by regulation the qualifications for applicants for an interim-use permit for a fishery subject to a moratorium under this section. The qualifications must include the minimum requirements for past or present participation and harvest in the fishery. The commission may not issue an interim-use permit for a fishery subject to a moratorium under this section unless the applicant can satisfy the qualifications established under this subsection and establish the present ability and intent to participate actively in the fishery.

###### Sec. 16.43.227.   Southeast Alaska Dungeness crab fishery.

(a) The commission may establish a moratorium on new entrants into the southeast Alaska Dungeness crab fishery for a continuous period of up to four years without complying with AS 16.43.225(a)§(c). While the moratorium is in effect, the commission shall

(1) conduct the investigation required under AS 16.43.225(d);

(2) establish by regulation the qualifications for an interim-use permit for the fishery, including minimum requirements for past or present participation and harvest in the fishery; and

(3) issue interim-use permits for the fishery to applicants who satisfy the qualifications established under (2) of this subsection and who establish the present ability and intent to participate actively in the fishery.

(b) Notwithstanding AS 16.43.225, for the purposes of this chapter

(1) an interim-use permit issued under this section shall be treated as an interim-use permit issued under AS 16.43.225;

(2) a moratorium established under this section shall be treated as a moratorium established under AS 16.43.225.

(e) [Repealed,§22 ch 9 SLA 2014.]

(f) Notwithstanding AS 16.43.225, for the purposes of this chapter,

(1) an interim-use permit issued under this section shall be treated as an interim-use permit issued under AS 16.43.225;

(2) a moratorium established under this section shall be treated as a moratorium established under AS 16.43.225.

(g) The commission may not consider participation in a fishery, subject to a moratorium on entry under this section, that occurs during the period of the moratorium in determining eligibility for an entry permit that may be issued for the fishery after termination of the moratorium.

###### Sec. 16.43.230.   Designation of distressed fisheries.

Pending the determination of maximum numbers of entry permits under AS 16.43.240 and before the initial issue of entry permits under AS 16.43.270, the commission shall designate as distressed fisheries those for which it estimates that the optimum number of entry permits will be less than the highest number of units of gear fished in that fishery during any one of the four years immediately preceding January 1, 1973.

###### Sec. 16.43.240.   Determination of the maximum number of entry permits for initial issue.

(a) Except as provided in AS 16.43.270(a), the maximum number of entry permits for a distressed fishery designated under AS 16.43.230 shall be the highest number of units of gear fished in that fishery during any one of the four years immediately preceding January 1, 1973.

(b) When the commission finds that a fishery, not designated as a distressed fishery under AS 16.43.230 or not subject to a moratorium under AS 16.43.225, has reached levels of participation that require the limitation of entry under AS 16.43.140§16.43.330 in order to achieve the purposes of this chapter, the commission shall establish the maximum number of entry permits for that fishery.

(c) When the commission finds that a fishery subject to a moratorium under AS 16.43.225 has reached levels of participation that require the limitation of entry under AS 16.43.140§16.43.330 in order to achieve the purposes of this chapter, the commission shall establish the maximum number of entry permits for that fishery.

###### Sec. 16.43.250.   Standards for initial issue of entry permits.

(a) Following the establishment of the maximum number of units of gear for a particular fishery under AS 16.43.240, the commission shall adopt regulations establishing qualifications for ranking applicants for entry permits according to the degree of hardship that they would suffer by exclusion from the fishery. The regulations shall define priority classifications of similarly situated applicants based upon a reasonable balance of the following hardship standards:

(1) degree of economic dependence upon the fishery, including, when reasonable for the fishery, the percentage of income derived from the fishery, reliance on alternative occupations, availability of alternative occupations, investment in vessels and gear;

(2) extent of past participation in the fishery, including, when reasonable for the fishery, the number of years of participation in the fishery, and the consistency of participation during each year.

(b) The commission shall designate in the regulations those priority classifications of applicants who would suffer significant economic hardship by exclusion from the fishery.

(c) The commission shall designate in the regulations those priority classifications of applicants who would suffer only minor economic hardship by exclusion from the fishery.

(d) If an individual eligible to apply under AS 16.43.260(a) has applied during application periods established under AS 16.43.260(b) for two or more entry permits under AS 16.43.260(d) or (e) for the same specific fishery resource and the same specific type of gear in different administrative areas, but has failed to qualify for an entry permit for that type of fishery resource and gear, the individual's cumulative qualifications may be credited to the fishery for which the individual is most qualified. The commission shall issue an entry permit to the individual for the fishery if the individual's cumulative qualifications result in placing the individual in a category designated in (b) of this section. The qualifications credited to a fishery under this subsection may not be considered for the purpose of ranking the applicant under (a)-(c) of this section for any other fishery.  The commission may not revoke any permit previously issued notwithstanding the issuance of permits in excess of the maximum number established under AS 16.43.230§16.43.240 as a result of this subsection.  In this subsection, "fishery" includes all salmon fisheries of the state for which a maximum number of entry permits has been established by the commission under AS 16.43.240(b).

(e) If the cumulative qualifications of an individual under (d) of this section include points granted by the commission under (a) of this section for more than one fishery and the number of points required to place an applicant in the priority classification under (b) of this section is not the same for each of the fisheries, the commission shall obtain a quotient for the individual by dividing the number of points the individual has been granted for each fishery by the number of points needed to place an applicant in a priority classification under (b) of this section for that fishery.  If the sum of the quotients obtained under this subsection equals or exceeds 1.00, the individual is entitled to a permit under (d) of this section.

###### Sec. 16.43.260.   Application for initial issue of entry permits.

(a) The commission shall accept applications for entry permits only from applicants who have harvested fishery resources commercially while participating in the fishery as holders of gear licenses issued under former AS 16.05.536§16.05.670 or interim-use permits under AS 16.43.210(a) or 16.43.225 before the qualification date established in (d), (e), or (f) of this section. The commission may specify by regulation the calendar years of participation that will be considered for eligibility purposes.

(b) The commission shall establish the opening and closing dates, places and form of application for entry permits for each fishery.  The commission may require the submission of specific verified evidence establishing the applicant's qualifications under the regulations adopted under AS 16.43.250.

(c) When an applicant is unable to establish qualifications for an entry permit by submitting the specific verified evidence required in the application by the commission, the applicant may request and obtain an administrative adjudication of the application according to the procedures established in AS 16.43.110(b).  At the hearing the applicant may present alternative evidence of qualifications for an entry permit.

(d) Except as provided in (e) or (f) of this section, an applicant shall be assigned to a priority classification based solely upon the applicant's qualifications as of January 1, 1973.

(e) Except as provided in (f) of this section, when the commission establishes the maximum number of entry permits for a particular fishery under AS 16.43.240 after January 1, 1975, an applicant shall be assigned to a priority classification based solely upon the applicant's qualifications as of January 1 of the year during which the commission establishes the maximum number of entry permits for the fishery for which application is made.

(f) When the commission establishes the maximum number of entry permits under AS 16.43.240 for a fishery that is subject to a moratorium under AS 16.43.225, an applicant for an entry permit for the fishery shall be assigned to a priority classification based solely upon the applicant's qualifications as of the effective date of the statute or regulation establishing the moratorium.

###### Sec. 16.43.270.   Initial issuance of entry permits.

(a) The commission shall issue entry permits, for each fishery, first to all qualified applicants in the priority classifications designated under AS 16.43.250(b) and then to qualified applicants in order of descending priority classification, until the number of entry permits issued equals the maximum number of entry permits established under AS 16.43.230 and 16.43.240 for each fishery, except that a person within a priority classification specified under AS 16.43.250(b) may not be denied an entry permit.

(b) If, within the lowest priority classification of qualified applicants to which some entry permits may be issued, there are more applicants than there are entry permits to be issued, then the allocation of entry permits within that priority classification shall be by lottery.  However, the commission shall issue entry permits to all qualified applicants in that priority classification if the total number of permits issued for the fishery does not exceed the maximum number of entry permits established under AS 16.43.240 for that fishery by more than five percent or 10 permits, whichever is greater.

(c) If, at the time entry permits are issued, some applicants are still appealing the findings of an administrative adjudication under AS 16.43.260, a sufficient number of permits shall be reserved out of the permits to be issued to protect the rights of those applicants, assuming all the appeals will be resolved in favor of the applicants.  In the event that all appeals are not resolved in favor of the applicants, the remaining entry permits shall be allocated to the next most qualified applicants as provided in (a) and (b) of this section.

(d) The commission may restrict the fishing capacity employed under an entry permit if, before the initial issuance of entry permits for a fishery, the commission determines that the fishing capacity in the fishery must be limited to achieve the purposes of this chapter, establishes criteria for determining the fishing capacity that is allowed under an entry permit, and establishes how fishing capacity will be measured. The maximum fishing capacity allowed under an entry permit must be based upon past participation in the fishery by the initial recipient of the entry permit during a period, specified by the commission, preceding the qualification date established under AS 16.43.260. The commission may define fishing capacity in terms of quantity of fishing gear, a proportion of the maximum amount of gear that can be utilized in the fishery under regulations of the Board of Fisheries, fishing vessel size or other characteristics, or other factors determined by the commission to affect the amount of fishing effort in the fishery. The recipient or transferee of an entry permit issued subject to this subsection may not exceed the fishing capacity allowed under the entry permit.

#### Article 4. Reduction to Optimum Number of Entry Permits.

###### Sec. 16.43.290.   Optimum number of entry permits.

Following the issuance of entry permits under AS 16.43.270, the commission shall establish the optimum number of entry permits for each fishery based upon a reasonable balance of the following general standards:

(1) the number of entry permits sufficient to maintain an economically healthy fishery that will result in a reasonable average rate of economic return to the fishermen participating in that fishery, considering time fished and necessary investments in vessels and gear;

(2) the number of entry permits necessary to harvest the allowable commercial take of the fishery resource during all years in an orderly, efficient manner, and consistent with sound fishery management techniques;

(3) the number of entry permits sufficient to avoid serious economic hardship to those currently engaged in the fishery, considering other economic opportunities reasonably available to them.

###### Sec. 16.43.300.   Revisions of optimum number of entry permits.

(a) The commission may increase or decrease the optimum number of entry permits for a fishery when one or more of the following conditions makes a change desirable considering the purposes of this chapter:

(1) an established long-term change in the biological condition of the fishery has occurred that substantially alters the optimum number of entry permits permissible applying the standards set out in AS 16.43.290;

(2) an established long-term change in market conditions has occurred, directly affecting the fishery, that substantially alters the optimum number of entry permits permissible under the standards set out in AS 16.43.290.

(b) If the commission decreases the optimum number of entry permits for a fishery, the number of entry permits may be reduced only under the voluntary buy-back provisions set out in AS 16.43.310 and 16.43.320.

###### Sec. 16.43.310.   Establishment of buy-back funds and permit buy-back assessments.

(a) When the optimum number of entry permits is less than the number of entry permits outstanding in a fishery, the commission may establish a buy-back program, a buy-back plan, and a buy-back fund for that fishery.

(b) The commission may establish by regulation a permit buy-back assessment for each fishery for which the commission has established a buy-back fund under (a) of this section. The amount of the assessment may not exceed seven percent of the value, as defined in AS 43.75.290, of fish that a permit holder in the fishery subject to the assessment removes from the state or transfers to a buyer in the state. The Department of Revenue shall collect an assessment established under this subsection.

(c) The commission shall expend money appropriated to a buy-back fund for the purpose of reducing the number of entry permits in the fishery to the optimum number, at a rate to be established by the commission. The legislature may appropriate interest accrued on the money in a buy-back fund to that fund. Except as provided in AS 16.43.320, money appropriated to a buy-back fund does not lapse.

###### Sec. 16.43.320.   Administration of the buy-back program.

The commission shall adopt regulations providing for the purchase of transferable entry permits with money in the buy-back fund for each fishery. The commission shall cease purchases of entry permits in a fishery when the number of entry permits in the fishery has been reduced to the optimum number. The commission shall terminate a buy-back assessment established for a fishery under AS 16.43.310(b) when the commission determines that the amount of revenue collected through the assessment is sufficient to purchase the number of entry permits necessary to achieve the optimum number of entry permits in the fishery and to offset the reasonable costs of the buy-back program for the fishery, including repayment of any debt the commission was authorized to incur to capitalize the buy-back fund for the fishery. The unexpended balance of appropriations made to a buy-back fund for a fishery shall lapse back into the fund from which the money was appropriated at the end of the fiscal year in which the buy-back program is terminated.

###### Sec. 16.43.330.   Issuance of new entry permits; appropriations related to fleet reduction.

(a) When the number of outstanding entry permits for a fishery is less than the optimum number established under AS 16.43.290, the commission shall issue new entry permits to applicants who are presently able to engage actively in the fishery until the optimum number is reached.

(b) The commission shall determine equitable methods of issuance, as appropriate, under (a) of this section that assure the receipt of fair market value for the permits issued.

(c) If a salmon fishery association qualified under AS 16.40.250 takes part in a fleet reduction program by expending money or incurring debt to contract with permit holders to relinquish the holders' entry permits under AS 16.43.150(i), and if this section requires additional permits to be issued for the same fishery in which the fleet reduction program was implemented, the legislature may appropriate any resulting revenue to the association for reimbursement of money expended or to retire any outstanding debt incurred for fleet reduction purposes. An appropriation under this subsection must be made within 30 years after the date the money was expended or debt incurred.

## Chapter 45. Pacific Marine Fisheries Compact.

###### Sec. 16.45.010.   Governor's power to execute compact.

The governor may execute a compact on behalf of the state to cooperate in the Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission.

###### Sec. 16.45.020.   The compact.

The form and contents of the compact must be substantially as provided in this section, and the effect of its provisions shall be interpreted and administered in conformity with the provisions of this section:

THE PACIFIC MARINE FISHERIES COMPACT  The contracting states agree as follows:

The purposes of this compact are to promote the better use of fisheries, marine, shell, and anadromous, which are of mutual concern, and to develop a joint program of protection and prevention of physical waste of the fisheries in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean and adjacent waters over which the compacting states jointly or separately have or acquire jurisdiction.

Nothing in this compact may be construed to authorize the compacting states to limit the production of fish or fish products, to establish or fix the prices of the fish or fish products or create and perpetuate a monopoly.

This agreement becomes operative immediately as to those states executing it when two or more of the states of California, Oregon, and Washington execute it in the form that is in accordance with the laws of the executing state and the Congress has given its consent.

Each state joining in this compact shall appoint, as determined by state statutes, one or more representatives to a commission constituted and designated in this compact as the Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission, of whom one shall be the administrative or other officer of the agency of the state charged with the conservation of the fisheries resources to which this compact pertains.  This commission shall be invested with the powers and duties set out in this compact.

The term of each commissioner of the Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission is four years.  A commissioner holds office until a successor is appointed and qualified, but the successor's term expires four years from the legal date of expiration of the term of the successor's predecessor.  Vacancies occurring in the office of a commissioner from any reason or cause shall be filled for the unexpired term, or a commissioner may be removed from office, as provided by the statutes of the state concerned.  Each commissioner may delegate in writing from time to time to a deputy the power to be present and participate including voting as a representative or substitute, at a meeting of or hearing by or other proceeding of the commission.

Voting powers under this compact are limited to one vote for each state regardless of the number of representatives.

The duty of the said commission is to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time the methods, practices, circumstances, and conditions which are disclosed for bringing about the conservation and the prevention of the depletion and physical waste of the fisheries, marine, shell, and anadromous, in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean and adjacent waters over which the compacting states jointly or separately have or acquire jurisdiction.  The commission may recommend the coordination of the exercise of the police powers of the several states within their respective jurisdictions and the conservation zones to promote the preservation of those fisheries and their protection against overfishing, waste, depletion, or any abuse whatsoever and to assure a continuing yield from the fisheries resources of the signatory parties to this compact.

To that end the commission shall draft and, after consultation with the advisory committee authorized by art. VII of this compact, recommend to the governors and legislative branches of the signatory states to this compact legislation dealing with the conservation of the marine, shell, and anadromous fisheries in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean over which the compacting states jointly or separately have or acquire jurisdiction.  The commission shall, more than one month before a regular meeting of the legislative branch in a signatory state, present to the governor of the state its recommendations relating to enactments by the legislative branch of that state in furthering the purposes of this compact.

The commission shall consult with and advise the pertinent administrative agencies in the signatory states with regard to problems connected with the fisheries and recommend the adoption of the regulations it considers advisable and which lie within the jurisdiction of the agencies.

The commission may recommend to the signatory states the stocking of the waters of such states with marine, shell, or anadromous fish and fish eggs or joint stocking by some or all of the states, and, when two or more of the states jointly stock waters, the commission shall act as the coordinating agency for the stocking.

The commission shall elect from its number a chairman and a vice chairman and shall appoint and at its pleasure remove or discharge the officers and employees required to carry the provisions of this compact into effect and shall fix and determine their duties, qualifications, and compensation.  The commission shall adopt rules for the conduct of its business. It may establish and maintain one or more offices for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time or place in the signatory states, but must meet at least once a year.

No action may be taken by the commission except by the affirmative vote of a majority of the number of compacting states represented at a meeting.  No recommendation may be made by the commission in regard to a species of fish except by the vote of a majority of the compacting states which have an interest in the species.

The fisheries research agencies of the signatory states shall act in collaboration as the official research agency of the Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission.

An advisory committee to be representative of the commercial fishermen, commercial fishing industry, and other interests of each state which the commission deems advisable shall be established by the commission as soon as practicable to advise the commission upon the recommendations it desires to make.

Nothing in this compact may be construed to limit the powers of a state or to repeal or prevent the enactment of legislation or the enforcement of a requirement by a state imposing additional conditions and restrictions to conserve its fisheries.
