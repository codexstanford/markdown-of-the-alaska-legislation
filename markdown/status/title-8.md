###### Sec. 08.62.045.   Pilotage tariffs. [Repealed,ยง35 ch 89 SLA 1991.]

###### Sec. 08.62.046.   Rates for pilotage services.

(a) A pilot organization recognized by the board shall adopt and publish rates for the provision of pilotage services. The pilot organization shall adopt rates for pilotage services as provided under this section. Notwithstanding this section, a pilot organization may enter into agreements with the master, owner, operator, or agent of a master, owner, or operator, of a vessel for the provision of pilotage services at rates of compensation that are different from the rates adopted under this section. Unless a pilot organization has an agreement with the master, owner, operator, or agent of a master, owner, or operator, of a vessel that sets rates for the provision of a pilotage service, the pilot organization may not charge a rate for the provision of the pilotage service to the vessel that is different from the rate adopted or established under this section.

(b) If a pilot organization intends to adopt a new or revised rate for the provision of a pilotage service, the pilot organization shall, before October 15, send a notice of intent to adopt a rate for provision of the pilotage service to the board and to all registered agents and publish the notice on at least three days during a period of 14 consecutive days in a newspaper of general circulation in the state. The notice of intent to adopt a rate must include a copy of the proposed rate and the name and mailing address of the pilot organization that intends to adopt the rate. If no objection to the proposed rate is filed with the board under (c) of this section, the rate takes effect on January 1 of the year following the year in which the notice of the intent to adopt the rate was filed with the board.

(c) The master, owner, operator, or agent of the master, owner, or operator, of a vessel required to employ a pilot under this chapter may object to the proposed rate for a specific pilotage service by filing a written notice of objection, containing the grounds for the objection and relevant evidence demonstrating that the rate is not reasonable, with the board within 60 days after the final date of publication of the proposed rate in a newspaper of general circulation. The pilot organization that proposed the rate has until 15 days after the close of the period for filing objections to the proposed rate to provide its written response to the notice of objection and relevant evidence demonstrating that the rate is reasonable. If the pilot organization does not respond to the notice of objection by the close of the 15-day period for response to the objection, the board may not take action on the proposed rate and the proposed rate does not take effect. If the pilot organization does respond to the notice of objection before the close of the response period, the board shall hold a hearing to determine whether the proposed rate is reasonable. If the board finds that the proposed rate is reasonable, the rate is approved and takes effect retroactive to January 1 of the calendar year in which the rate would have taken effect under (b) of this section if no objection had been filed. If the board finds that the proposed rate is not reasonable, the proposed rate is disapproved and does not take effect. In determining what constitutes a reasonable rate, the board shall consider the following factors:

(1) current and historical rates charged for comparable pilotage services;

(2) the actual time aboard the vessel, time engaged in preparing to provide the pilotage services, seasonal and weather conditions, and risks;

(3) the reasonable expenses incurred in providing the pilotage services such as dispatch, transportation, overhead, and other associated expenses;

(4) the financial effect of pilotage expenses on the owner of the vessel, except that this factor shall only be considered if the owner provides all financial information that the board determines is necessary to determine the financial effect;

(5) the number of vessels and volume of pilotage services at issue in the dispute and the number of members of the pilot organization;

(6) the effect of the determination on the income of affected pilots relative to prior years, taking into account changes in vessel tonnage and vessel traffic in the pilotage region from year-to-year;

(7) prior determinations under this subsection; and

(8) other factors the board considers relevant.

(d) Pending the review and approval of the proposed rate for a specific pilotage service by the board under (c) of this section, the current rate then in effect for that pilotage service remains in effect until the board approves the proposed rate. If the proposed rate approved by the board is greater than the current rate, then the master, owner, or operator of the vessel or the vessel is liable for the payment of the additional amount owed for the provision of pilotage services during the pendency of the review by the board due to retroactive application of the approved rate under (c) of this section. If the proposed rate is less than the current rate, then the pilot organization is liable to the master, owner, or operator of the vessel or the vessel for reimbursement of the amount overpaid for the provision of pilotage services during the pendency of the review by the board due to the retroactive application of the approved rate under (c) of this section.

(e) If the board finds under (c) of this section that a proposed rate is not reasonable, the pilot organization may propose a new rate for that pilotage service within 60 days after the decision of the board is issued by sending a notice of intent to adopt a rate for provision of the pilotage service to the board and to all registered agents and publishing the notice on at least three days during a period of 14 consecutive days in a newspaper of general circulation in the state. The notice of intent to adopt a rate must include a copy of the proposed rate and the name and mailing address of the pilot organization that intends to adopt the rate. If a timely objection to the proposed rate is not filed with the board under (c) of this section, the rate takes effect retroactive to January 1 of the same calendar year in which the initial rate proposed under (b) of this section would have taken effect if no objection had been filed. If a timely objection is filed, the provisions of (c) and (d) of this section apply to the proposed rate.

(f) The board shall provide a schedule of rates adopted under this section to agents registered under AS 08.62.187.

###### Sec. 08.62.050.   Marine pilot coordinator.

(a) The department, with the approval of the board, may hire a marine pilot coordinator who is qualified to assist the board in administering and enforcing the provisions of this chapter. The coordinator is in the partially exempt service under AS 39.25.120.

(b) The person who is hired as coordinator may not

(1) be an active member of a pilot organization in the state;

(2) work as a pilot while employed as the coordinator, except to the extent required by official duties; or

The bond may be in the name of the broker with the association as an additional insured or in the name of the association with the broker as an additional insured. The bond must cover the maximum funds that will be within the control of the community association manager at any time while the bond is in force. The commission may grant an exemption from the bonding requirement of this subsection if the commission determines that the community association manager has equivalent comparable coverage or that coverage is unavailable. The commission may adopt regulations to implement this subsection, including regulations concerning the minimum coverage and terms of coverage that are required and proof of bond and the granting of exemptions.
