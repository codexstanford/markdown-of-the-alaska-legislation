# Title 38. Public Land.

## Chapter 04. Policy for Use and Classification of State Land Surface.

#### Article 1. Public and Private Land Use.

###### Sec. 38.04.005.   Policy.

(a) In order to provide for maximum use of state land consistent with the public interest, it is the policy of the State of Alaska to plan and manage state-owned land to establish a balanced combination of land available for both public and private purposes.  The choice of land best suited for public and private use shall be determined through the inventory, planning, and classification processes set out in AS 38.04.060§38.04.070.

(b) In classifying and making state land available for private use and settlement purposes, the director shall consider the natural resources and conditions present on the land and shall seek to minimize the adverse effect of private settlement on wildlife, fishery, mineral, timber, and other significant resources of the land; the director shall also make adequate provision for public open space which is accessible to communities so that natural areas are easily reached from all communities and settled areas. The amount of that land shall be sufficient to meet existing and projected needs for accessible public recreation land.  Special care shall be taken to preserve public access to public water and to retain state ownership of sufficient land which combine high value for recreation and other public purposes with accessibility to settled areas.  This classification for public purposes does not constitute dedication to open space, but the division's management of land so classified shall be in a manner to preserve the identified values.

(c) In allocating land for private use and public retention, the requirements of future generations shall be considered.  To this end, a supply of state land of a variety of types and locations shall be reserved to provide an opportunity for future decisions.

(d) Private land use rights are integral to the material well-being of the people of Alaska and our society.

(e) The involvement of a proximately located municipality and of local residents is essential in classifying and making state land available for private use and settlement.  The director shall, when appropriate, hold public meetings in the communities most affected by the disposal to solicit the views of the residents of the communities affected.

(f) Land owned by the Board of Regents of the University of Alaska is not subject to the provisions of this chapter.

###### Sec. 38.04.010.   Public interest in making land available for private use.

(a) The primary public interest in conveying rights to state land surface to private parties is to make them available to individuals and other persons for direct use in areas classified as suitable for these purposes.  In making state land available for private use, the director shall seek to guide year-round settlement to areas where public services already exist, or can be extended with reasonable economy, or where development of a viable economic base is probable.

(b) State land that is located beyond the range of existing schools and other necessary public services, or that is located where development of sources of employment is improbable, may be made available for seasonal recreational purposes or for low density settlement. The seasonal recreation use or low density settlement shall have sufficient separation between residences so that public services will not be necessary or expected. The availability of timber, firewood, and water resources shall be considered in determining separation between residences. By considering the availability of timber, firewood, and water under this subsection or in making any disposal decision, the state does not by virtue of that consideration imply any right of the person receiving the disposal to an exclusive or other right to the timber, firewood, or water, that the state will not make any other disposals in the area, or that any disposals made will be limited in type or any other manner.

###### Sec. 38.04.015.   Public interest in retaining state land in public ownership.

The primary public interests in retaining areas of state land surface in public ownership are

(1) to make them available on a sustained-yield basis for a variety of beneficial uses including subsistence, energy development, aquaculture, forestry, grazing, sport hunting and fishing, hiking, snowmobiling, skiing, and other activities of a type which can generally be made available to more people and conducted more successfully if the land is in public rather than private ownership;

(2) to facilitate mining and mineral leasing by managing appropriate public land for surface uses which are compatible with subsurface uses;

(3) to protect critical wildlife habitat and areas of special scenic, recreational, scientific, or other environmental concern;

(4) to restrict development in hazardous locations such as floodplains and avalanche zones; and

(5) to guide the location of settlement and development to minimize public costs and maximize social and economic benefits.

#### Article 2. Land Availability for Private Use.

###### Sec. 38.04.020.   Land disposal bank.

(a) The commissioner shall establish a land disposal bank containing state land classified for disposal into private ownership.

(b) The land disposal bank does not include

(1) land nominated for selection or selected by a municipality to satisfy a general grant land entitlement under AS 29.65 or former AS 29.18.201§29.18.213;

(2) land retained in state ownership for multiple-use management;

(3) land where less than a fee simple title has been conveyed;

(4) land retained in state ownership under an enactment of the legislature or by the governor or a state agency under authority of law.

(c) Land to be retained in state ownership may be classified by the commissioner into multiple-use management categories under AS 38.05.300.  Land outside a municipality to be retained in state ownership consists of land classified for retention in state ownership by the commissioner by July 1, 1985. Land conveyed to the state by the federal government that is to be retained in state ownership consists of land classified by the commissioner within two years of receipt of tentative approval or patent, whichever occurs first.  State land not classified for retention in state ownership or selected by a municipality under this section shall be classified and included in the land disposal bank.  The commissioner shall ensure that the bank includes at least 500,000 acres.

(d) By January 15 of the first session of each legislature, the commissioner shall notify the legislature that the commissioner has available a report on the status of land in the land disposal bank under the following categories:

(1) land suitable for homestead disposal;

(2) land suitable for subdivision disposal;

(3) land suitable for agricultural, commercial, or industrial disposal; and

(4) land suitable for other purposes.

(e) The commissioner shall annually submit to the governor an appropriation request for funding estimated to be necessary for the next two years to allow

(1) survey and disposal of land proposed to be made available for homestead staking, with the general location of the land;

(2) survey and disposal of land to be offered as agricultural, commercial, industrial, or other uses under AS 38.05.055 or 38.05.057, with the general location of the land;

(3) the survey and disposal of land proposed to be offered as subdivisions, with the general location of the land;

(4) preliminary feasibility studies, engineering design work, right-of-way acquisition, and construction of access roads and capital improvements required by municipal subdivision ordinance or regulation of the platting authority;

(5) identification of land that will be proposed for disposal under this subsection in future fiscal years.

(f) The request of the commissioner under (e) of this section shall include an analysis and an assessment of the market demand for the land proposed for disposal.

(g) After July 1 of each year, the commissioner shall direct the expenditure of money appropriated for the disposal of land in response to requests made under (e) and (f) of this section for the following:

(1) land designated as suitable for homestead disposal shall be classified and surveyed under this chapter and AS 38.05 and made available for staking and lease under AS 38.09;

(2) land designated as suitable for subdivision and homesite disposal shall be surveyed, subdivided, classified, and disposed of under this chapter, AS 38.05, and AS 38.08;

(3) land designated commercial, industrial, or suitable for other disposal shall be sold under AS 38.05.055 or 38.05.057;

(4) land designated agricultural shall be disposed of under AS 38.05.055§38.05.065, except the Board of Agriculture and Conservation (AS 03.09.010) shall receive notice of each proposed disposal and be given an opportunity to comment before the final disposal decision is made.

(h) Individual parcels disposed of in subdivisions intended for private residential or recreational use may not exceed five acres unless the commissioner determines that a larger size is necessary to comply with municipal ordinances; to permit the design of a viable subdivision because of topographical features, soil conditions, on-site sewage disposal requirements, or water drainage or supply considerations that are unique to the subdivision; to increase the return to the state from the sale of the parcels; to minimize adverse effect on wildlife, fishery, public recreation, timber, or other significant resources in the area; or to minimize adverse effect on other residential uses in the area.

(i) Nothing in this section prevents the disposal of other land by the commissioner in accordance with AS 38.05.055, 38.05.057, 38.05.070, the issuance of remote recreational cabin site leases or sales under AS 38.05.600, AS 38.08, AS 38.09, or other law.

(j) A person or an agency of the state may nominate land retained in state ownership for inclusion in the land disposal bank or may nominate land in the land disposal bank for retention in state ownership.  The commissioner shall hold public hearings semiannually to take nominations under this subsection.  A transfer of land from retention in state ownership to the land disposal bank or from the land disposal bank to retention in state ownership shall be accomplished through a classification order under AS 38.05.300 and with notice under AS 38.05.945. The commissioner shall make a written determination within six months after receipt of a nomination if the commissioner determines that the land nominated will not be classified or reclassified as requested.

(k) The commissioner may withdraw from the land disposal bank state land that has been offered for disposal but not conveyed within five years after the inclusion in the land disposal bank.  State land withdrawn from the land disposal bank under this section must be reclassified under AS 38.04.065.

###### Sec. 38.04.021.   Disposal of municipal grant land entitlements. [Repealed,§38 ch 91 SLA 1997.]

###### Sec. 38.04.022.   State land disposal income fund.

(a) The revenue from the state land disposal program shall be deposited in the state land disposal income fund in the state treasury. On June 30 of each fiscal year, the portion of that fund that exceeds $5,000,000 shall be deposited in the state general fund. The legislature may appropriate money from the state land disposal income fund for expenditure by the Department of Natural Resources for necessary costs incurred by the commissioner in the implementation of state land disposal programs authorized under this title or for any other public purpose.

(b) Within five days after the legislature convenes in regular session, the Department of Natural Resources shall notify the legislature that a report reflecting all money deposited in the fund established under (a) of this section during the prior fiscal year is available.

###### Sec. 38.04.025.   Variety of uses. [Repealed,§88 ch 152 SLA 1984.]

###### Sec. 38.04.030.   Land availability programs.

Programs that may be used by the director to make the state's land surface available for private use under AS 38.04.020§38.04.055 include sale of whole or partial rights to the fee simple estate, including conveyance of agricultural use rights; leasing; open-to-entry; homesiting; homesteading; permitting for construction and occupation of cabins in isolated locations on land retained in state ownership; and other methods as provided by law. However, agricultural use rights may be conveyed only after consulting with the Board of Agriculture and Conservation.

###### Sec. 38.04.035.   Criteria for program selection.

In determining which land availability program is appropriate for state land in different locations, the director shall be guided by the following criteria:

(1) to cover public costs associated with private land use and to provide the public with a fair return for publicly owned property, conveyance of state land to private parties shall be at fair market value except where otherwise authorized by statute, or by an administrative regulation the adoption of which is specifically permitted by statute;

(2) sale or lease programs should be used where land is readily accessible to a major community center or where, because of a prime location on waterfront or a transportation route or some other location characteristic, land has relatively high real estate value;

(3) sale programs are preferred but lease programs may be used

(A) where special land use controls are required and there is a high public interest in having certain types of land used for particular purposes;

(B) when the intended use is a temporary one;

(C) in commercial or industrial situations when a leasehold can provide cash flow advantages to the lessee;

(D) when a unique location with special public values is involved, as in a deep water port, hydroelectric site, or aquaculture facility;

(E) where current demand for private use is high, but projections suggest that, in the future, the land may be more valuable for public use, as in accessible waterfront recreation areas;

(4) limited or conditional title may be granted when the state's best interest so dictates; among other things, title limitations may include grants of agricultural interest only, retention of development rights, and retention of scenic or other easements; a conditional title may be tied to a development schedule or other standards of performance.

###### Sec. 38.04.040.   Availability of university land. [Repealed,§88 ch 152 SLA 1984.]

###### Sec. 38.04.045.   Survey and subdivision.

(a)  [Repealed,§88 ch 152 SLA 1984.]

(b) Before the issuance of a long-term lease under AS 38.05.070 or of a patent for state land, an official cadastral survey shall be accomplished, unless a comparable, approved survey exists that has been conducted by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Before land may be offered under AS 38.08 or AS 38.09, or before land may be offered under AS 38.05.055 or 38.05.057, except land that is classified for agricultural uses, an official rectangular survey grid shall be established. The rectangular survey section corner positions shall be monumented and shown on a cadastral survey plat approved by the state. For those areas where the state may wish to convey surface estate outside of an official rectangular survey grid, the commissioner may waive monumentation of individual section corner positions and substitute an official control survey with control points being monumented and shown on control survey plats approved by the state. The commissioner may not issue more than one conveyance for each section within a township outside of an official rectangular survey grid. Land to be conveyed may not be located more than two miles from an official survey control monument except that the commissioner may waive this requirement on a determination that a single purpose use does not justify the requirement if the existing status of the land is known with reasonable certainty. The lots and tracts in state subdivisions shall be monumented and the cadastral survey and plats for the subdivision shall be approved by the state. Where land is located within a municipality with planning, platting, and zoning powers, plats for state subdivisions shall comply with local ordinances and regulations in the same manner and to the same extent as plats for subdivisions by other landowners. State subdivisions shall be filed and recorded in the district recorder's office. The requirements of this section do not apply to land made available for material sales, for short-term leases, for parcels adjoining a surveyed right-of-way, or for land that has been open to random staking under the homestead program in the past; however, for short-term leases, the lessee shall comply with local subdivision ordinances unless waived by the municipality under procedures specified by ordinance. In this subsection, "a single purpose use" includes a communication site, an aid to navigation, and a park site.

###### Sec. 38.04.050.   Access to private use areas.

Wherever state land is surveyed for purposes of private use, legal rights-of-way and easements shall be reserved for access and, where appropriate, for utility services to each parcel of land.  A right-of-way or easement shall be located to assure adequate and feasible access for the purposes for which the right-of-way or easement was intended.  Where necessary and appropriate for the use intended or where required by local subdivision ordinances, the director shall arrange for the development of surface access as part of the land availability program.  The direct cost of local access development shall be borne by the recipient of the land unless otherwise provided by state statutes or regulations.

###### Sec. 38.04.055.   Access through private use areas.

The commissioner shall reserve easements and rights-of-way on and across land that is made available for private use as necessary to reach or use public water and public and private land. An easement or right-of-way reserved under this section shall include trails that have an established history of use for commerce, recreation, transportation, or providing access to a traditional outdoor activity. In this section, "traditional outdoor activity" has the meaning given in AS 38.04.200.

###### Sec. 38.04.058.   Restrictions on easement or right-of-way use.

The commissioner may, under terms agreed to in writing by a grantee, lessee, or interest holder of state land, restrict the use of an easement or right-of-way reserved under AS 38.04.050, 38.04.055, or other law in order to protect public safety or property. The commissioner may not agree to or enforce a restriction under this section unless the restriction is narrowly tailored to achieve the protection of public safety and property while preserving access to the maximum extent practicable and the commissioner makes a written finding identifying how the restriction will protect public safety and public or private property.

#### Article 3. Inventory, Planning, and Classification.

###### Sec. 38.04.060.   Inventory.

(a) The commissioner shall prepare and maintain on a continuing basis an inventory of all state land and water and their resource and other values, giving priority to areas of potential settlement, economic development, and critical environmental concern.  This inventory shall be kept current so as to reflect changes in conditions and to identify new and emerging resource and other values.

(b) The commissioner's inventory must include land and water under interagency assignment of land management authority and land and water proposed for such an assignment.  That land and water must be reviewed at regular intervals to analyze current and proposed uses as these uses relate to alternative uses for all or part of the land and to determine the uses which best provide for the public interest.

(c) As funds and manpower are made available, the commissioner shall provide local and federal governments and major private landowners with data from the inventory for the purpose of planning and managing the uses of land in proximity to state land.

###### Sec. 38.04.062.   Identification of state submerged land.

(a) Except as provided in (f) of this section, the state owns all submerged land underlying navigable water to which title passed to the state at the time the state achieved statehood under the equal footing doctrine or 43 U.S.C. 1301§1315 (Submerged Lands Act of 1953).

(b) The commissioner shall compile, maintain, and make public a list and map of all water in the state that the commissioner, the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, or a state or federal court determines was navigable water at the time the state achieved statehood. The submerged land underlying that navigable water shall be included in the inventory of state land prepared under AS 38.04.060.

(c) The commissioner shall also maintain and make public a list of all water in the state that the commissioner determines, in consultation with the commissioner of fish and game, was nonnavigable at the time the state achieved statehood.

(d) Water not included on the lists described in (b) or (c) of this section is not considered either navigable or nonnavigable until the commissioner has made a determination as to its navigability at the time the state achieved statehood. In addition, the commissioner may make corrections and alterations to the lists described in (b) and (c) of this section to maintain the accuracy of each list.

(e) A determination made by the commissioner under this section

(1) does not create an interest in or right of entry onto any real property that does not otherwise exist under state law;

(2) may not be recorded; and

(3) does not constitute final agency action.

(f) Submerged land that the state conveyed under AS 38.05.820 and 38.05.825 is not subject to the state's assertion of ownership under (a) of this section.

(g) In this section,

(1) "navigable water" means water that, at the time the state achieved statehood, was used, or was susceptible of being used, in its ordinary condition as a highway for commerce over which trade and travel were or could have been conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water; the use or potential use does not need to have been without difficulty, extensive, or long and continuous;

(2) "nonnavigable water" means surface water that was not navigable water at the time the state achieved statehood.

###### Sec. 38.04.065.   Land use planning and classification.

(a) Except as provided in (d) and (h) of this section, the commissioner shall, with local governmental and public involvement under AS 38.05.945, adopt, maintain, and, when appropriate, revise regional land use plans that provide for the use and management of state-owned land.

(b) In the adoption and revision of regional and site-specific land use plans, the commissioner shall

(1) use and observe the principles of multiple use and sustained yield;

(2) consider physical, economic, and social factors affecting the area and involve other agencies and the public in achieving a systematic interdisciplinary approach;

(3) give priority to planning and classification in areas of potential settlement, renewable and nonrenewable resource development, and critical environmental concern;

(4) rely, to the extent that it is available, on the inventory of the state land, its resources, and other values;

(5) consider present and potential uses of state land;

(6) consider the supply, resources, and present and potential use of land under other ownership within the area of concern;

(7) plan for compatible surface and mineral land use classifications; and

(8) provide for meaningful participation in the planning process by affected local governments, state and federal agencies, adjacent landowners, and the general public.

(c) The commissioner shall adopt regional land use plans for state land. Each regional land use plan must identify and delineate

(1) areas of settlement and settlement impact, where land must be classified for various private uses, renewable and nonrenewable resource development, and for public recreation, open space, and other public uses desirable in and around settlement; and

(2) areas that must be retained in state ownership and planned and classified for various uses and purposes under AS 38.04.015.

(d) The commissioner may adopt as a land use plan a comprehensive plan adopted by a municipality having planning and zoning powers or a land management plan adopted by another governmental entity if the commissioner determines that the plan adequately recognizes and protects state interests. A decision to adopt the plan must be preceded by public hearings in affected and interested communities and by a draft decision, available for public review, that describes the state's interests and how the state will implement the plan.

(e) Land shall be classified as provided in AS 38.05.300.

(f) Each decision about the location of easements and rights-of-way, other than for minor access, shall be integrated with land use planning and classification.

(g) Each land use plan adopted by the commissioner under this section shall be consistent with municipal land use plans to the maximum extent determined consistent with the state interests and the purposes of this chapter.

(h) Before the commissioner adopts a regional land use plan, a land classification may be made on the basis of a site-specific land use plan. After adoption of a regional land use plan, land classifications shall be made under the plan.

(i) An oil and gas lease sale or gas only lease sale is not subject to this section. Oil and gas lease sales and gas only lease sales are subject to the planning process established under AS 38.05.180.

###### Sec. 38.04.070.   Management categories.

State land classified for uses and purposes involving retention in public ownership may be included in the following management categories:

(1) state public reserve land: areas of public land to be managed for a wide variety of compatible uses and purposes in accordance with the principles of multiple use and sustained yield; land designated to this category may include, but need not be limited to, state forest reserves and state wildlife reserves as well as land classified for public purposes within settlement impact areas;

(5) state public domain: land within areas designated on regional plans as settlement and settlement impact which are not part of the management categories listed in (1)§(4) of this section; through classification, this land may be made available for private use, settlement, and development as well as for public uses associated with settlement and development.

#### Article 4. Access to State Land and Fishing Streams.

###### Sec. 38.04.200.   Traditional means of access.

(a) The commissioner may not manage state land, water, or land and water so that a traditional means of access for traditional outdoor activities is restricted for the purpose of protecting aesthetic values of the land, water, or land and water or is prohibited unless the restriction or prohibition is

(1) for an area of land, water, or land and water that encompasses 640 contiguous acres or less;

(2) temporary in nature and effective cumulatively less than eight months in a three-year period;

(3) for the protection of public safety and public or private property;

(A) with the express approval of the commissioner; and

(B) if the application for the preference right is filed with the director within three years from

(i) the occurrence of the error or omission;

(ii) the date of acquisition by the state of the land; or

(iii) the date of a court decision or settlement nullifying a disposal of state land;

(3) grant a preference right to a claimant who shows bona fide improvement of state land or of federal land subsequently acquired by the state and who has in good faith sought to obtain title to the land but who, through error or omission of others occurring within the three years before (A) the application for the preference right, (B) the date of acquisition by the state of the land, or (C) the date of a court decision or settlement nullifying a disposal of state land, has been denied title to it; upon a showing satisfactory to the commissioner, the claimant may lease or purchase the land at the price set on the date of original entry on the land or, if a price was not set at that time at a price determined by the director to fairly represent the value of unimproved land at the time the claim was established, but in no event less than the cost of administration including survey; the error or omission of a predecessor in interest or an agent, administrator, or executor that has clearly prejudiced the claimant may be the basis for granting a preference right;

(4) sell land by lottery for less than the appraised value when, in the judgment of the director, past scarcity of land suitable for private ownership in any particular area has resulted in unrealistic land values;

(5) when the director determines it is in the best interest of the state and will avoid injustice to a person or the heirs or devisees of a person, dispose of land, by direct negotiation to that person who presently uses and who used and made improvements to that land before January 3, 1959, or to the heirs or devisees of the person; the amount paid for the land shall be its fair market value on the date that the person first entered the land, as determined by the director; a parcel of land disposed of under this paragraph shall be of a size consistent with the person's prior use, but may not exceed five acres;

(6) after consulting with the Board of Agriculture and Conservation (AS 03.09.010), dispose of an interest in land limited to use for agricultural purposes by lottery;

(7) convey to an adjoining landowner for its fair market value a remnant of land that the director considers unmanageable or a parcel of land created by a highway right-of-way alignment or realignment, or a parcel created by the vacation of a state-owned right-of-way if

(A) the director determines that it is in the best interests of the state;

(B) the parcel

(i) does not exceed the minimum lot size under an applicable zoning code; or

(ii) is smaller than 20 acres and is completely enclosed by property owned by the adjacent landowner; and

(C) the director and the platting authority having land use planning jurisdiction agree that conveyance of the parcel to the adjoining landowner will result in boundaries that are convenient for the use of the land by the landowner and compatible with municipal land use plans;

(c) A parcel of land may be conveyed under (b) of this section without classification or reclassification under AS 38.05.300.

(d) A parcel of land described in (b)(7) of this section must be sold at its fair market value as determined by the director on the basis of an appraisal completed as provided in AS 38.05.840. Nothing in this subsection prevents the sale of land under AS 38.05.055 or 38.05.057 to a person not qualifying as an adjoining landowner if the adjoining landowner declines to purchase the land.

(e) Upon a written finding that the interests of the state will be best served, the director may, with the consent of the commissioner, approve contracts for the sale, lease, or other disposal of available land, resources, property, or interests in them. In approving a contract under this subsection, the director need only prepare a single written finding. In addition to the conditions and limitations imposed by law, the director may impose additional conditions or limitations in the contracts as the director determines, with the consent of the commissioner, will best serve the interests of the state. The preparation and issuance of the written finding by the director are subject to the following:

(1) with the consent of the commissioner and subject to the director's discretion, for a specific proposed disposal of available land, resources, or property, or of an interest in them, the director, in the written finding,

(A) shall establish the scope of the administrative review on which the director's determination is based, and the scope of the written finding supporting that determination; the scope of the administrative review and finding may address only reasonably foreseeable, significant effects of the uses proposed to be authorized by the disposal;

(B) may limit the scope of an administrative review and finding for a proposed disposal to

(i) applicable statutes and regulations;

(ii) the facts pertaining to the land, resources, or property, or interest in them, that the director finds are material to the determination and that are known to the director or knowledge of which is made available to the director during the administrative review; and

(C) may, if the project for which the proposed disposal is sought is a multiphased development, limit the scope of an administrative review and finding for the proposed disposal to the applicable statutes and regulations, facts, and issues identified in (B)(i)§(iii) of this paragraph that pertain solely to the disposal phase of the project when

(i) the only uses to be authorized by the proposed disposal are part of that phase;

(ii) the disposal is a disposal of oil and gas, or of gas only, and, before the next phase of the project may proceed, public notice and the opportunity to comment are provided under regulations adopted by the department;

(iii) the department's approval is required before the next phase of the project may proceed; and

(iv) the department describes its reasons for a decision to phase;

(2) the director shall discuss in the written finding prepared and issued under this subsection the reasons that each of the following was not material to the director's determination that the interests of the state will be best served:

(A) facts pertaining to the land, resources, or property, or an interest in them other than those that the director finds material under (1)(B)(ii) of this subsection; and

(B) issues based on the statutes and regulations referred to in (1)(B)(i) of this subsection and on the facts described in (1)(B)(ii) of this subsection;

(3) a written finding for an oil and gas lease sale or gas only lease sale under AS 38.05.180 is subject to (g) of this section;

(4) a contract for the sale, lease, or other disposal of available land or an interest in land is not legally binding on the state until the commissioner approves the contract, but if the appraised value is not greater than $50,000 in the case of the sale of land or an interest in land, or $5,000 in the case of the annual rental of land or interest in land, the director may execute the contract without the approval of the commissioner;

(5) public notice requirements relating to the sale, lease, or other disposal of available land or an interest in land for oil and gas, or for gas only, proposed to be scheduled in the five-year oil and gas leasing program under AS 38.05.180(b), except for a sale under (6)(F) of this subsection, are as follows:

(A) before a public hearing, if held, or in any case not less than 180 days before the sale, lease, or other disposal of available land or an interest in land, the director shall make available to the public a preliminary written finding that states the scope of the review established under (1)(A) of this subsection and includes the applicable statutes and regulations, the material facts and issues in accordance with (1)(B) of this subsection, and information required by (g) of this section, upon which the determination that the sale, lease, or other disposal will serve the best interests of the state will be based; the director shall provide opportunity for public comment on the preliminary written finding for a period of not less than 60 days;

(B) after the public comment period for the preliminary written finding and not less than 90 days before the sale, lease, or other disposal of available land or an interest in land for oil and gas or for gas only, the director shall make available to the public a final written finding that states the scope of the review established under (1)(A) of this subsection and includes the applicable statutes and regulations, the material facts and issues in accordance with (1) of this subsection, and information required by (g) of this section, upon which the determination that the sale, lease, or other disposal will serve the best interests of the state is based;

(6) before a public hearing, if held, or in any case not less than 21 days before the sale, lease, or other disposal of available land, property, resources, or interests in them other than a sale, lease, or other disposal of available land or an interest in land for oil and gas or for gas only under (5) of this subsection, the director shall make available to the public a written finding that, in accordance with (1) of this subsection, sets out the material facts and applicable statutes and regulations and any other information required by statute or regulation to be considered upon which the determination that the sale, lease, or other disposal will best serve the interests of the state was based; however, a written finding is not required before the approval of

(A) a contract for a negotiated sale authorized under AS 38.05.115;

(B) a lease of land for a shore fishery site under AS 38.05.082;

(F) an exempt oil and gas lease sale or gas only lease sale under AS 38.05.180(d) of acreage subject to a best interest finding issued within the previous 10 years or a reoffer oil and gas lease sale or gas only lease sale under AS 38.05.180(w) of acreage subject to a best interest finding issued within the previous 10 years, unless the commissioner determines that substantial new information has become available that justifies a supplement to the most recent best interest finding for the exempt oil and gas lease sale or gas only lease sale acreage and for the reoffer oil and gas lease sale or gas only lease sale acreage; however, for each oil and gas lease sale or gas only lease sale described in this subparagraph, the director shall call for comments from the public; the director's call for public comments must provide opportunity for public comment for a period of not less than 30 days; if the director determines that a supplement to the most recent best interest finding for the acreage is required under this subparagraph,

(i) the director shall issue the supplement to the best interest finding not later than 90 days before the sale;

(ii) not later than 45 days before the sale, the director shall issue a notice describing the interests to be offered, the location and time of the sale, and the terms and conditions of the sale; and

(iii) the supplement has the status of a final written best interest finding for purposes of (i) and (l) of this section;

(G) a surface use lease under AS 38.05.255;

(H) a permit, right-of-way, or easement under AS 38.05.850;

(7) the director shall include in

(A) a preliminary written finding, if required, a summary of agency and public comments, if any, obtained as a result of contacts with other agencies concerning a proposed disposal or as a result of informal efforts undertaken by the department to solicit public response to a proposed disposal, and the department's preliminary responses to those comments; and

(B) the final written finding a summary of agency and public comments received and the department's responses to those comments.

(f) The director shall grant a preference right to the purchase or lease without competitive bid of up to five acres of state land to an individual who has erected a building on the land and used the land for bona fide business purposes for five or more years under a federal permit or without the need for a permit and, after selection by the state, under a state use permit or lease, if the business produced no less than 25 percent of the total income of the applicant for the five years preceding the application to purchase or lease the land. The director shall sell or lease the land at a price determined by the director to represent the current fair market value of the unimproved land but in no event less than the cost of administration including survey if required. If the director determines in a written finding that the purchase or lease of the land would interfere with public use by residents of the area, the director may condition the purchase or lease to mitigate the adverse effects on the public use or may reject the application for the preference right. A lease granted under this subsection may not be for a period in excess of 50 years.

(g) Notwithstanding (e)(1)(A) and (B) of this section, when the director prepares a written finding required under (e) of this section for an oil and gas lease sale or a gas only lease sale scheduled under AS 38.05.180, the director shall consider and discuss

(1) in a preliminary or final written finding facts that are known to the director at the time of preparation of the finding and that are

(A) material to issues that were raised during the period allowed for receipt of public comment, whether or not material to a matter set out in (B) of this paragraph, and within the scope of the administrative review established by the director under (e)(1) of this section; or

(B) material to the following matters:

(i) property descriptions and locations;

(ii) the petroleum potential of the sale area, in general terms;

(iii) fish and wildlife species and their habitats in the area;

(iv) the current and projected uses in the area, including uses and value of fish and wildlife;

(v) the governmental powers to regulate the exploration, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas or of gas only;

(vi) the reasonably foreseeable cumulative effects of exploration, development, production, and transportation for oil and gas or for gas only on the sale area, including effects on subsistence uses, fish and wildlife habitat and populations and their uses, and historic and cultural resources;

(vii) lease stipulations and mitigation measures, including any measures to prevent and mitigate releases of oil and hazardous substances, to be included in the leases, and a discussion of the protections offered by these measures;

(viii) the method or methods most likely to be used to transport oil or gas from the lease sale area, and the advantages, disadvantages, and relative risks of each;

(ix) the reasonably foreseeable fiscal effects of the lease sale and the subsequent activity on the state and affected municipalities and communities, including the explicit and implicit subsidies associated with the lease sale, if any;

(x) the reasonably foreseeable effects of exploration, development, production, and transportation involving oil and gas or gas only on municipalities and communities within or adjacent to the lease sale area; and

(xi) the bidding method or methods adopted by the commissioner under AS 38.05.180; and

(2) the basis for the director's preliminary or final finding, as applicable, that, on balance, leasing the area would be in the state's best interest.

(h) In preparing a written finding under (e)(1) of this section, the director may not be required to speculate about possible future effects subject to future permitting that cannot reasonably be determined until the project or proposed use for which a written best interest finding is required is more specifically defined, including speculation about

(1) the exact location and size of an ultimate use and related facilities;

(2) except as otherwise provided in AS 38.05.073 for land suitable for recreational facilities development leasing, the economic feasibility of ultimate development; and

(3) future environmental or other laws that may apply at the time of any future development.

(i) A person who is eligible to file an administrative appeal or a request for reconsideration, as appropriate, under this subsection and who is aggrieved by the final written finding of the director entered under (e)(5) or (6) of this section may, within 20 days after the issuance of the final written finding, file an administrative appeal or request reconsideration of the decision by the commissioner. A person is eligible to file an administrative appeal or a request for reconsideration if the person

(1) meaningfully participated in the process set out in this chapter for receipt of public comment by

(A) submitting written comment during the period for receipt of public comment; or

(B) presenting oral testimony at a public hearing, if a public hearing was held; and

(2) is affected by the final written finding.

(j) An administrative appeal or a request for reconsideration submitted under (i) of this section must specify the written finding complained of and the specific basis upon which it is challenged. The commissioner shall grant or deny the administrative appeal or reconsideration request within 30 days after issuance of the final written finding. Failure of the commissioner to act on the request for reconsideration within this period is a denial of the request for reconsideration and a final administrative decision for purposes of appeal to the superior court.

(k) If an administrative appeal or a request for reconsideration is granted, the commissioner may order the director to issue a new final written finding as may be required under the circumstances.

(l) A person may appeal a final written finding issued under (e)(5) or (6) of this section to the superior court, but only if the person was eligible to request, and did request, an administrative appeal or reconsideration of that finding under (i) of this section. The person shall initiate the appeal within 30 days from the date that the decision on administrative appeal or reconsideration is mailed or otherwise distributed, or the date the request for reconsideration is considered denied by the commissioner's failure to act on the request, whichever is earlier. The points on appeal are limited to those presented to the commissioner in the person's administrative appeal or request for reconsideration.

(m) For purposes of appeal under (l) of this section, the burden is upon the party seeking review to establish the invalidity of the finding.

(n) The director may not deny an application for a lease or assignment of a lease of state land for the development and operation of a gas storage facility solely because the gas storage facility would be used exclusively or primarily to store gas owned by the owner or operator of the gas storage facility. In this subsection, "gas storage facility" has the meaning given in AS 31.05.032.

(o) The director may approve exploration or development for all or part of an area previously approved for oil and gas or gas only leasing under (e) of this section. An approval applies to exploration or development commencing during a period for up to 10 years, as specified by the director in the approval. When authorizing exploration or development under this subsection, the department shall provide public notice and the opportunity to comment using the methods described in AS 38.05.945(b) and (c). The approval authorizes a lessee to begin exploration or development during the period specified in the approval, subject to the lessee receiving other authorizations required from the department or other state, local, or federal agencies. Once a lessee begins exploration or development on a lease or group of leases, the approval for exploration under this subsection or the approval for development under this subsection remains valid for the term of the lease. This subsection does not relieve lessees of any statutory, regulatory, or lease obligations, including any obligations to submit for approval plans of operation, of exploration, or of development.

(p) Where there is a valid municipal entitlement selection on state land under AS 29.65.010§29.65.030 that has a state-issued land lease that has been issued competitively under AS 38.05.070 and before the decision to approve the municipal entitlement land selection, the director shall grant a preference right to purchase without further competitive bid of up to five acres of the state land to an individual who has erected a building approved by a lease on the state land and used the land for bona fide business purposes for 10 or more years under a state lease, if the business produced not less than 25 percent of the total income of the applicant for the 10 years preceding the application to purchase the land. An application for a preference right under this section must be filed with the director within 120 days after notice to the lessee of the municipal entitlement land selection. If the director grants the preference right, the director shall sell the land at a price determined by the director to represent the current fair market value of the unimproved land determined by an appraisal under AS 38.05.840 and a survey, both at the cost of the applicant. If the director determines that the purchase of the land would interfere with public use by residents of the area, the director may condition the purchase to mitigate the adverse effects on the public in the written finding under (e) of this section or may reject the application if those effects cannot be avoided or mitigated. If the preference right application is approved, the amount of land within the overall municipal entitlement under AS 29.65.010§29.65.030 shall be reduced by the amount of land covered under this section; however, subject to appropriation, the revenue from the purchase of the parcel will be given to the municipality if the municipal entitlement land selection is approved.

If the commissioner does not receive an application for a parcel of state land or if a purchaser fails to sign a lease agreement or contract of sale, the parcel shall be offered to the first eligible person to apply for the parcel.  If the parcel was designated as a homesite and offered to the public under former AS 38.05.047(f), the parcel shall be disposed of under the terms required by AS 38.08.

Immediately following the drawing of an applicant's name in the lottery, the applicant shall be given an opportunity to select for purchase one parcel of the land that is offered in the lottery. The names of alternate applicants shall be drawn after all parcels have been selected. If the applicant who originally selected a parcel unequivocally rejects the offer to purchase the parcel or fails to sign the contract of sale within the period of time specified by the commissioner, the parcel shall be offered for sale to alternate applicants in the order in which their names were drawn.

(d) If a contract for a sale of state land has been breached, the director may issue a decision to foreclose and terminate the contract at any time 31 days after delivering by certified mail a written notice of the breach to the address of record of the purchaser.  A breach caused by the failure to make payments required by the contract may be cured within 30 days after the notice of the breach has been received by the purchaser by payment of the sum in default together with the larger of a fee of $50 or five percent of the sum in default. If there are material facts in dispute between the state and the purchaser, the purchaser may submit a written request for a public hearing for the review of the facts within 30 days after the notice of the breach has been received.

The commissioner may request proposals from potential lessees under this section if consistent with an adopted land use plan that expressly allows the specific type of development under consideration.  Consistent with AS 38.04.065, the development of a land use plan used to identify land suitable for recreational facilities development leasing must consider the supply of recreational opportunities and alternatives, economic and social factors, and fish, wildlife, and other resources affected by the specific type and location of recreational facilities development under consideration.

The comments received under this subsection become part of the public record for the consideration of the commissioner.

(d) If the commissioner decides to solicit proposals, the commissioner shall prepare a written request for proposals that includes

(1) the specific type of recreational facilities development for which the land may be leased;

(2) the form of compensation that the commissioner intends to require for the lease under (1) of this subsection;

The proposals submitted to the commissioner must include the specific facts on which the potential lessee bases its ability to develop the land, including its ability to comply with the items identified in (d)(1)§(4) of this section.

(f) After soliciting proposals under (e) of this section, if the commissioner determines that only one potential lessee is acceptable, the commissioner may begin negotiations with the potential lessee to develop the terms and conditions for the lease.

(g) After soliciting proposals under (e) of this section, if the commissioner determines that two or more potential lessees are acceptable, the commissioner may select the potential lessee who submits the highest bid during a public auction or by sealed bids, whichever method the commissioner chooses. The minimum bid must equal the amount established by the commissioner plus the administrative fee established under (k) of this section. The commissioner shall also require the potential lessee to make an earnest money deposit under AS 38.05.860(b). After the commissioner selects a potential lessee, the commissioner may begin negotiations with the potential lessee to develop the terms and conditions for the lease.

(h) After developing proposed lease terms and conditions with a potential lessee under (f), (g), or (j) of this section, the commissioner may issue a preliminary decision under AS 38.05.035(e) that leasing the land to the potential lessee on the proposed terms and conditions serves the best interests of the state.  During preparation of the preliminary decision, the commissioner shall consult with affected state agencies regarding issues within the agencies' areas of responsibility and expertise.  The commissioner shall give public notice of the preliminary decision under AS 38.05.945 and request comments from the public and state agencies.

(i) After reviewing the comments received under (h) of this section, the commissioner shall make a final determination whether the proposed lease will serve the best interests of the state.  If the commissioner determines that the proposed lease will serve the best interests of the state, the commissioner shall offer the lease to the proposed lessee subject to the terms, conditions, and study requirements the commissioner determines to be necessary. If a study or plan is required, the potential lessee may be required to provide and pay for the study or plan.  For a large project where the commissioner has determined under (h) of this section that there may be significant economic, social, or environmental effects or long-term commitments of fish, wildlife, or other natural resources, the commissioner shall require the potential lessee to prepare and submit a comprehensive economic feasibility study to be completed no later than 18 months after the execution of the lease. State agencies with pertinent expertise or responsibilities shall be involved in the review of required plans and studies.  If the plan or study involves fish, game, or customary and traditional use of natural resources, the Department of Fish and Game shall review the methodology and scope of the plan or study.  If the Department of Fish and Game determines that the methodology and scope are appropriate for the plan or study, the methodology and scope may be used for the plan or study.

(j) If a potential lessee who was selected under (g) of this section declines the lease offer made under (i) of this section, the commissioner may begin negotiations with the potential lessee who provided the next highest bid under (g) of this section to develop under (g) of this section the terms and conditions for a lease.

(4) a fixed annual rent that is not less than the fair market rental value of the land;

(5) a fee for each user;

(6) other compensation acceptable to the commissioner; or

(7) a combination of the above.

(n) The annual compensation paid to the state for a recreational facilities development lease shall be reevaluated and adjusted at five-year intervals.  The annual compensation for each five-year period after the initial five years of the lease shall be calculated by the same method used to establish the compensation for the initial five-year period.

(o) Before a lease is issued under this section, the land to be covered by the lease shall be surveyed.  The survey must be adequate to describe the land to be covered by the lease.

(p) Before entering into a lease under this section, the commissioner shall require the lessee to post a performance bond or provide other security acceptable to the commissioner to cover the costs to the department of one or more of the following, as determined by the commissioner:

(1) completing the development, including site planning, under the terms and conditions of the lease;

A bidder may be represented by an attorney or agent at a public auction. In the public notice of a lease to be offered at public auction or by sealed bid, the commissioner shall specify a minimum acceptable bid and the lease compensation method. The lease compensation method shall be designed to maximize the return on the lease to the state and shall be a form of compensation set out in AS 38.05.073(m). An aggrieved bidder may appeal to the commissioner within five days for a review of the determination. The leasing shall be conducted by the commissioner, and the successful bidder shall deposit at the public auction or with the sealed bid the first year's rental or other lease compensation as specified by the commissioner, or that portion of it that the commissioner requires in accordance with the bid. The commissioner shall require, under AS 38.05.860, qualified bidders to deposit a sum equal to any survey or appraisal costs reasonably incurred by another qualified bidder acting in accordance with the regulations of the commissioner or incurred by the department under AS 38.04.045 and AS 38.05.840. If a bidder making a deposit of survey or appraisal costs is determined by the commissioner to be the highest qualified bidder under this subsection, the deposit shall be paid to the unsuccessful bidder who incurred those costs or to the department if the department incurred the costs. All costs for survey and appraisal shall be approved in advance in writing by the commissioner. The commissioner shall immediately issue a receipt containing a description of the land or interest leased, the price bid, and the terms of the lease to the successful qualified bidder. If the receipt is not accepted in writing by the bidder under this subsection, the commissioner may offer the land for lease again under this subsection. A lease, on a form approved by the attorney general, shall be signed by the successful bidder and by the commissioner.

(b) When a valid existing federal grazing lease is cancelled to allow state selection of the area under lease, the lessee of the land has the preference right to lease the land without competitive bidding for a term equal to that originally granted in the cancelled federal lease and upon terms as favorable to the lessee as those contained in the cancelled federal lease.

(c) The owner or lessee of land that fronts on shoreland, tideland, or submerged land of the state may be granted a preference right to a lease for the shoreland, tideland, or submerged land without competitive bidding if the director determines that

(1) the lease of the shoreland, tideland, or submerged land is necessary to facilitate water transportation of goods, services, or resources to or from the owned or leased upland or for another water-dependent purpose;

(2) the proposed use of the shoreland, tideland, or submerged land is compatible with the classification of the land and with any applicable land use plan adopted under AS 38.04.065; and

(3) issuance of the lease to the shoreland, tideland, or submerged land will not interfere with prior existing rights to the leased land.

(d) If the commissioner issues a lease under (c) of this section, the right of access to the shoreland, tideland, or submerged land shall be nonexclusive in the lessee unless the commissioner grants the lessee the exclusive right to use the shoreland, tideland, or submerged land.

(e) The commissioner may require prequalification of bidders for a lease to be issued under AS 38.05.070. If the commissioner determines to require prequalification, the procedures established by this section and the notice including prequalification requirements required to be given under AS 38.05.945 shall be completed within 75 days of the receipt of the first lease application unless the commissioner grants additional time for the completion of the procedures. Within the 75-day period or the additional time granted by the commissioner, the commissioner shall complete

(1) classification under AS 38.05.300;

(2) the procedures required by AS 38.05.035(e);

(3) any other action required by law for the disposal of the lease to a bidder except survey, appraisal, and the auction or sealed bid.

(f) If, after completion of the procedures required by (e) of this section, the commissioner determines that there is only one qualified bidder, the commissioner may issue a lease without competitive bidding at the approved, appraised market value of the land determined under AS 38.05.840 or by another form of lease compensation specified by the commissioner from among those set out in AS 38.05.073(m) and designed to maximize the return on the lease to the state. The commissioner may establish terms and conditions for entry to the land pending survey and appraisal of the land. The commissioner shall issue the lease as soon as is practicable following the survey and appraisal of the land subject to the provisions of AS 38.05.035(e).

(g) Notice of an auction or sealed bid required under this section shall be made by certified mail to all prequalified bidders.

(h) A person aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner under this section may appeal to the commissioner within five days of the prequalification decision. The decision of the commissioner under this subsection may be appealed to the superior court.

(a) The director, with the approval of the commissioner, may lease tide and submerged land for fisheries development. Fisheries development includes the utilization of shore gill nets or set nets for the taking of fish.  Every lease issued under this section shall reserve to the public a right-of-way for access to navigable waters and other tide and submerged land.

(b) The director may classify land as subject to leases for fisheries development and publicly invite applications for lease of the selected areas. Each application shall be accompanied by an affidavit to the effect that the applicant presently intends to personally utilize the leased area for fishing purposes the following season. If two or more applications are received for the same shore area, the director shall award the lease to the most qualified applicant. In determining the qualifications of applicants, the director shall consider the length of time during which the applicant has been engaged in set netting, the proximity of the past fishing sites of the applicant to the land to be leased, the present ability of the applicant to utilize the location to its maximum potential, and other factors relevant to the equitable assignment of the disputed area. If the director cannot determine a preference between conflicting applicants for the same lease site on the basis of qualifications, the director shall select between the applicants by lot. An aggrieved applicant may appeal to the commissioner within 30 days for a review of the director's determination.

(c) A lease for set net fishing may be issued for any period not exceeding 10 years.  If the commissioner determines that the land is not being utilized for the purpose for which the lease is issued, the lease may be declared void.

(d) Subleasing and renewals of leases are governed by AS 38.05.095 and 38.05.102.

(e) The lease of submerged land conveys no interest in the water above the land or in the fish in the water.

(f) The shore fisheries development lease program account is established in the state treasury.

###### Sec. 38.05.083.   Aquatic farming and hatchery site leases.

(a) The commissioner may offer to the public for lease at public auction or by sealed bid under AS 38.05.075 or by negotiation under AS 38.05.070 a site for aquatic farming or related hatchery operations. Before a final decision to issue a lease under this section, the commissioner shall give notice and allow opportunity for comment in accordance with AS 38.05.945 and may hold a hearing to take testimony. Before a final decision to issue a lease under this section, the commissioner shall consider all relevant comment or testimony submitted under this section, AS 38.05.945, or 38.05.946.

(b) The commissioner, for good cause, may deny an application for issuance of a lease under this section but shall provide the applicant with written findings that explain the reasons for the denial.

(c) A site may be leased under this section for not less than the appraised fair market value of the lease. The value of the lease shall be reappraised every five years.

(d) A lease under this section may be assigned, but, if the assignee changes the use of the site, the lease reverts to the state.

(e) Before entering into a lease under this section, the commissioner shall require the lessee to post a performance bond or provide other security to cover the costs to the department of restoring the leased site in the event the lessee abandons the site.

(f) The commissioner shall adopt regulations establishing criteria for the approval or denial of leases under this section and for limiting the number of sites for which leases may be issued in an area in order to protect the environment and natural resources of the area. The regulations must provide for the consideration of upland management policies and whether the proposed use of a site is compatible with the traditional and existing uses of the area in which the site is located.

(g) The commissioner may, under AS 38.05.070(e)§(g), renew or extend a lease issued under this section.

(h) Nothing in this section prohibits a lessee under this section using a site for aquatic farming and related hatchery operations from also using that site for a tourism enterprise or educational purpose relating to aquatic farming or related hatchery operations.

(i) Notwithstanding AS 38.05.035 and 38.05.850, if a site leased under this section is actively used for aquatic farming or related hatchery operations, the commissioner may not charge a lessee, sublessee, or other person assigned all or a part of the lease a fee for using or allowing the use of the site, or passage across the site, for a tourism enterprise or educational purpose relating to aquatic farming or related hatchery operations.

(b) When not in conflict with this section, the provisions of AS 38.05.070§38.05.105 apply to leases under this section.

###### Sec. 38.05.090.   Removal or reversion of improvements upon termination of leases.

(a) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the commissioner, a lessee shall remove from a former leasehold

(1) all personal property, including above-ground tanks, transportable buildings, equipment, machinery, tools, and other goods, not belonging to the state, within 30 days after termination of the lease; and

(2) all buildings and fixtures, including gravel pads, and below-ground tanks, foundations, and slabs, not belonging to the state, within 60 days after termination of the lease.

(b) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the commissioner, the lessee shall restore the leasehold to a good and marketable condition, acceptable to the commissioner, within 120 days after termination of the lease.

(c) If the lessee does not remove personal property, buildings, and fixtures as required within the time specified under (a) of this section, title to the personal property, buildings, and fixtures that remain automatically vests in the state unless the commissioner elects to remove and dispose of the remaining personal property, buildings, and fixtures of the lessee. The commissioner may assess upon the lessee the cost of removing and disposing of personal property, buildings, and fixtures remaining upon the land.

(d) If the lessee does not restore the land within the time period specified under (b) of this section, the commissioner may have the land restored and assess the costs upon the lessee.

(f) Private residential improvements of a lessee that have become fixtures of the land and that are not removed by that lessee upon termination of the lease shall be purchased by the subsequent purchaser of the land if the improvements were authorized in the former lease or by permit from the director and if they have a net value of more than $10,000. The net value is the value of the improvements as determined by an appraisal approved by the commissioner, less all rents due the department, all costs of restoration under (d) of this section, and all department expenses estimated to be incurred in making the sale. After termination of the former lessee's lease, and at additional times as determined necessary by the commissioner, the value of the authorized residential fixtures shall be determined by an independent appraisal made at the cost of the former lessee. A notice or offer by the state to sell formerly leased land under this subsection must state (1) the appraised value of authorized residential fixtures remaining on the land that must be purchased, and (2) that that cost is included in the purchase price. Out of the proceeds of the sale, the department shall pay to the former lessee the appraised value of the residential improvements, less all rents due the department, all costs of restoration due the department under (d) of this section, and all department expenses incurred in making the sale.

Timber shall be sold either by sealed bids or public auction, depending on which method is determined by the commissioner to be in the best interests of the state, to the highest qualified bidder as determined by the commissioner. An aggrieved bidder may appeal to the commissioner within five days after the sale for a review of the determination. The sale shall be conducted by the commissioner, and, at the time of sale, the successful bidder shall deposit the amount specified in the terms of sale. The means by which the amount of deposit is determined shall be prescribed by appropriate regulation. The commissioner shall immediately issue a receipt containing a description of the timber purchased, the price bid, and the terms of sale. The receipt shall be accepted in writing by the bidder. A contract of sale, on a form approved by the attorney general, shall be signed by the purchaser, and the contract shall be signed by the commissioner on behalf of the state. The commissioner may impose conditions, limitations, and terms considered necessary and proper to protect the interests of the state. Violation of any provision of this chapter or the terms of the contract of sale subjects the purchaser to appropriate legal action.

###### Sec. 38.05.123.   Negotiated timber sales for local manufacture of wood products.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of AS 38.05.115 and 38.05.120, and upon a finding that the sale is in the best interest of the state, the commissioner may negotiate a sale of timber for use in the local manufacture of high value-added wood products. A timber sale contract entered into under this section may provide for a harvest of up to 10,000,000 board feet of timber each year, consistent with sustained yield principles, and may be for a term of up to 10 years. Initial stumpage rates for a contract under this section shall be determined by negotiation but may not be less than the base price for the area as established under regulations adopted by the commissioner. A contract under this section must provide that stumpage rates shall be redetermined by negotiation at least once every three years during the term of the contract, to reflect changes in market conditions; the redetermined rates may not be less than the base price for the area as established under regulations adopted by the commissioner. The commissioner shall by regulation set a maximum number of contracts, but not less than two, per region of the state that may be negotiated each year under this section.

(b) Notice of intent to negotiate a contract under this section shall be given in accordance with AS 38.05.945.

(c) The commissioner may negotiate a sale of timber under this section if the prospective purchaser agrees to use to the maximum extent commercially practicable the timber subject to the sale for the local manufacture of high value-added wood products. The commissioner shall determine the maximum amount of the timber being sold that is commercially practicable to use for those purposes and make the use of that percentage of the timber for those purposes a term of the contract. In evaluating proposals, the commissioner shall take into account the proposed manufacture of other value-added wood products to be produced under a negotiated contract.

(d) Before a sale may be negotiated under this section,

(1) the area of the sale must be designated for forestry purposes or other purposes that permit forestry uses by a valid existing area plan adopted under AS 38.04; and

(2) the requirements of AS 38.05.112 and 38.05.113 must be met.

(e) In making the best interest finding required by AS 38.05.035(e) and this section, the commissioner shall consider, in addition to other factors,

(1) the direct economic benefit from the local manufacture of high value-added wood products as a result of the sale;

(2) the direct economic benefit from other local processing of the timber to be undertaken by the purchaser as a result of the sale, including the manufacture of other value-added wood products in addition to high value-added wood products;

(3) the likelihood of commercial success of the locally manufactured high value-added wood products and other value-added wood products;

(4) the extent to which the sale is likely to result in the creation and maintenance of a stable local job base;

(5) the existence of adequate protection measures to ensure the sustainability of fish and wildlife habitat and populations and continuation of other uses of the area subject to the negotiated sale;

(6) the stumpage return to the state; and

(7) any other reasonably foreseeable benefits to the state and local economies from the sale.

(f) As part of the timber sale negotiations authorized by this section, the commissioner may require a prospective purchaser negotiating a timber sale contract to submit financial and technical data that demonstrates that the requirements of this section have been or will be met. Upon the prospective purchaser's request, the commissioner shall keep data provided by the purchaser confidential in accordance with the requirements of AS 38.05.035(a)(8).

(g) If the commissioner determines that additional analysis is necessary in order to complete the best interest finding for a sale under this section, the commissioner may require the prospective purchaser to retain and pay for the services of a contractor to assist the commissioner in evaluating the proposed negotiated sale and financial and technical data relating to the proposed sale. The contractor shall be selected by the prospective purchaser from a list of consultants in forestry and timber economics provided by the commissioner. If the commissioner requires a prospective purchaser to retain the services of a contractor under this subsection, the commissioner shall determine the scope of the work to be performed by the contractor.

(h) Under this section, a performance review shall be completed not more than five years after a timber sale contract is entered into by the department to ensure that the purchaser is performing in accordance with the terms of the contract. If the commissioner determines that the purchaser is not performing in accordance with the contract, the commissioner may terminate the contract.

(i) A timber sale negotiated under this section does not affect other timber harvest programs under AS 38.05.110§38.05.120.

(j) In this section,

(1) "high value-added wood product" means interior finish paneling, trim molding, flooring, doors, windows, cabinet stock, furniture, musical instruments or parts of instruments, toys, tools and implements, ready-to-assemble building kits, veneer, plywood, finger-jointed lumber, faced house logs, dissolving pulp, engineered wood products, paneled wood products, kiln-dried lumber, and other similar finished wood products as determined by the commissioner to have received processing beyond sawing and planing that adds high value to the wood product;

###### Sec. 38.05.133.   License procedures.

(a) The procedures in this section apply to the issuance of an exploration license under AS 38.05.132.

(b) The licensing process is initiated by the commissioner preparing, or a prospective licensee submitting to the commissioner, a proposal that identifies a specific area to be subject to the exploration license, proposes specific minimum work commitments, and states the minimum qualifications for a licensee as established by regulations adopted by the commissioner. A prospective licensee may initiate a proposal only in response to a call for proposals by the commissioner or during a period specified in regulations adopted by the commissioner. The regulations must provide for at least one period for that purpose during each calendar year.

(c) If the commissioner initiates the licensing process under (b) of this section, the commissioner shall publish notice of the commissioner's proposal in order to solicit comments and competing proposals.

(d) Within 30 days after receipt of a proposal from a prospective licensee under (b) of this section, the commissioner shall either reject it in a written decision or give public notice of the intent to evaluate the acceptability of the proposal. The commissioner shall solicit comments on a proposal for which public notice is given under this subsection, and shall request competing proposals.

(e) The commissioner may make a written request to a prospective licensee for additional information on the prospective licensee's proposal. The commissioner shall keep confidential information described in AS 38.05.035(a)(8) that is voluntarily provided if the prospective licensee has made a written request that the information remain confidential.

(f) After considering proposals not rejected under (d) of this section and public comment on those proposals, the commissioner shall issue a written finding addressing all matters set out in AS 38.05.035(e) and (g), except for AS 38.05.035(g)(1)(B)(xi). If the finding concludes that the state's best interests would be served by issuing an exploration license, the finding must (1) describe the limitations, stipulations, conditions, or changes from the initiating proposal or competing proposals that are required to make the issuance of the exploration license conform to the best interests of the state, and (2) if only one proposal was submitted, identify the prospective licensee whom the commissioner finds should be issued the exploration license. The commissioner shall attach to the finding a copy of the exploration license to be issued and the form of lease that will be used for any portion of the exploration license area subsequently converted to a lease under AS 38.05.134.

(g) If only one prospective licensee submits a proposal and the finding under (f) of this section concludes that an exploration license should be issued to that prospective licensee, the prospective licensee has 30 days after issuance of the finding within which to accept or reject the issuance of the exploration license, as limited or conditioned by the terms contained in the finding. The exploration license to be issued and the form of lease that will be used must be attached to that finding. The prospective licensee must accept or reject the issuance of the exploration license in writing.

(h) If competing proposals are submitted, and the commissioner's finding under (f) of this section concludes that an exploration license should be issued, the commissioner shall issue a request for competitive sealed bids, under procedures adopted by the commissioner by regulation, to determine which prospective licensee should be issued the exploration license. The finding provided to the prospective licensees and the public under (f) of this section must contain notice that (1) the commissioner intends to request competitive sealed bids, (2) a prospective licensee who intends to participate in the bidding must notify the commissioner in writing by the date specified in the notice, and (3) a prospective licensee's notice of intent to participate in the bidding constitutes acceptance of issuance of the exploration license, as limited or conditioned by the terms contained in the finding and by the exploration license to be issued and the form of lease to be used that have been attached to that finding, if the prospective licensee is the successful bidder. The successful bidder is the prospective licensee who submits the highest bid in terms of the minimum work commitment dollar amount.

###### Sec. 38.05.134.   Conversion to lease.

If the licensee requests and the commissioner determines that the work commitment obligation set out in an exploration license issued under AS 38.05.132 has been met, the commissioner shall convert to one or more leases all or part, as the licensee may indicate, of the area described in the exploration license that remains after the relinquishments, removals, or deletions required by AS 38.05.132(d)(2). A lease issued under this section

(1) is subject to the acreage limitations imposed by AS 38.05.140(c);

(2) is subject to AS 38.05.180(j)§(m), (o)§(u), and (x)§(z);

###### Sec. 38.05.140.   Limitations.

(a) A person may not take or hold coal leases or permits during the life of coal leases on state land exceeding an aggregate of 92,160 acres, except that a person may apply for coal leases or permits for acreage in addition to 92,160 acres, not exceeding a total of 5,120 additional acres of state land. The additional area applied for shall be in multiples of 40 acres, and the application shall contain a statement that the granting of a lease for additional land is necessary for the person to carry on business economically and is in the public interest. On the filing of the application, except as provided by AS 38.05.180(ff)(3) or 38.05.180(gg), the coal deposits in the land covered by the application shall be temporarily set aside and withdrawn from all other forms of disposal provided under AS 38.05.135§38.05.181.

(b) The commissioner shall, after posting notice of the pending application in the local land office, conduct public hearings on the application for additional acreage.  After public hearings, to the extent the commissioner finds to be in the public interest and necessary for the applicant in order to carry on business economically, the commissioner may, under regulations adopted by the commissioner, permit the person to take or hold coal leases or permits for an additional aggregate acreage of not more than 5,120 acres.

(c) A person may not take or hold at one time phosphate leases on state land exceeding in the aggregate 10,240 acres. A person may not take or hold sodium leases or permits during the life of sodium leases on state land exceeding in the aggregate acreage 5,120 acres, except that the commissioner may, where it is necessary in order to secure the economic mining of sodium compounds, permit a person to take or hold sodium leases or permits for up to 15,360 acres. A person may not take or hold at any one time oil or gas leases exceeding in the aggregate 500,000 acres granted on tide and submerged land, including leases held both as lessee and under option or operating agreement from others. A person may not take or hold at any one time oil or gas leases exceeding in the aggregate 750,000 acres on all land other than tide and submerged land, of which not more than 500,000 acres may be located north of the Umiat baseline, including leases held both as lessee and under option or operating agreement from others. Where more than a single person holds an interest in an oil or gas lease, each person shall be charged only with that percentage of the total acreage that corresponds to its percentage share of the total beneficial interest in the lease.

(d) The commissioner, for the purpose of encouraging the greatest ultimate recovery of coal, oil shale, phosphate, sodium, potassium, sulphur, and geothermal resources and in the interest of conservation of natural resources, after public hearing, or, when the state's title to land beneath navigable waters has been legally challenged by the United States and litigation initiated, may waive, suspend, refund, or reduce the rental, or minimum royalty, or reduce the royalty on an entire leasehold, or on any tract or portion of a leasehold segregated for royalty purposes, whenever the commissioner determines that it is necessary to do so in order to promote development, or that the lease cannot be successfully operated under its terms.  If the commissioner, in the interest of conservation, directs or assents to the suspension of operations and production under a lease granted, the payment of acreage rental or of minimum royalty prescribed by the lease may be suspended during the period of suspension of operations and production.  The term of the lease shall be extended by adding the period of suspension to the lease.

(e) The provisions of (d) of this section that apply to waiver, suspension, refund, or reduction of rental or minimum royalty apply to rental or minimum royalty paid before or after June 19, 1970, on any lease covering land beneath navigable waters which, according to the records of the division of lands, is in effect on June 19, 1970.

(f) The submerged and shoreland lying north of 57 degrees, 30 minutes, North latitude and east of 159 degrees, 49 minutes, West longitude within the Bristol Bay drainage are designated as the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve.

(b)  [Repealed,§58 ch 49 SLA 2004.]

(c)  [Repealed,§58 ch 49 SLA 2004.]

(d) A lease

(1) shall be automatically extended if and for so long thereafter as gas is produced in paying quantities from the lease and the lessee continues to meet all requirements of the lease; a lease issued under this section covering land on which there is a well capable of producing gas in paying quantities does not expire because the lessee fails to produce gas unless the lessee is allowed reasonable time to place the well on a producing status; if drilling has commenced on the expiration date of the primary term of the lease and is continued with reasonable diligence, including such operations as redrilling, sidetracking, or other means necessary to reach the originally proposed bottom hole location, the lease is extended for one year and for so long thereafter as gas is produced in paying quantities; a gas lease issued under this section that is subject to termination by reason of cessation of production does not terminate if, within 90 days after production ceases or a longer period determined at the discretion of the director, reworking or drilling operations are commenced on the land under lease and are thereafter conducted with reasonable diligence during the period of nonproduction; on application by the lessee, the director may extend the lease issued under this section for a period of not more than 10 years if the gas produced from the lease is to be used by the lessee solely for its mining operations;

(2) issued under former (c) of this section before January 1, 2004, may be extended at the discretion of the director; a lease may be extended under this paragraph upon application by the lessee; the director may once extend the lease for a period of not more than three years; in exercising discretion to extend a lease under this paragraph, the director may not extend the lease unless the director considers

(A) the extent of the shallow natural gas exploration activity already conducted on the lease and on adjacent areas;

(B) the probability that further shallow natural gas exploration activity will occur on the lease and will lead to shallow natural gas development and production; and

(C) whether extension of the lease's primary term will accelerate the eventual production of shallow natural gas from the lease.

(1) the people of Alaska have an interest in the development of the state's oil and gas resources to

(A) maximize the economic and physical recovery of the resources;

(B) maximize competition among parties seeking to explore and develop the resources;

(C) maximize use of Alaska's human resources in the development of the resources;

(2) it is in the best interests of the state

(A) to encourage an assessment of its oil and gas resources and to allow the maximum flexibility in the methods of issuing leases to

(i) recognize the many varied geographical regions of the state and the different costs of exploring for oil and gas in these regions;

(ii) minimize the adverse impact of exploration, development, production, and transportation activity; and

(B) to offer acreage for oil and gas leases or for gas only leases, specifically including

(i) state acreage that has been the subject of a best interest finding at annual areawide lease sales; and

(ii) land in areas that, under (d) of this section, may be leased without having been included in the leasing program prepared and submitted under (b) of this section.

(b) The commissioner shall annually prepare and, before February 1 of each calendar year notify the legislature of a five-year program of proposed oil and gas lease sales and proposed gas only lease sales, specifying as precisely as practicable the location of tracts to be offered for leasing during the calendar year of the notification and the following four calendar years. The commissioner may, at any time, notify the legislature of revisions, including additions, to the program. Notification to each legislator, by electronic message or other written means, constitutes notification to the legislature under this subsection.

(c) Except as provided in (d) and (w) of this section, an oil and gas lease sale or gas only lease sale may not be held unless it was included in the proposed leasing programs submitted to the legislature during the two calendar years preceding the year in which the sale is held.

(3) following a pre-sale analysis, the commissioner may choose at least one of the following leasing methods:

(A) a cash bonus bid with a fixed royalty share reserved to the state of not less than 12.5 percent in amount or value of the production removed or sold from the lease;

(B) a cash bonus bid with a fixed royalty share reserved to the state of not less than 12.5 percent in amount or value of the production removed or sold from the lease and a fixed share of the net profit derived from the lease of not less than 30 percent reserved to the state;

(C) a fixed cash bonus with a royalty share reserved to the state as the bid variable but no less than 12.5 percent in amount or value of the production removed or sold from the lease;

(D) a fixed cash bonus with the share of the net profit derived from the lease reserved to the state as the bid variable;

(E) a fixed cash bonus with a fixed royalty share reserved to the state of not less than 12.5 percent in amount or value of the production removed or sold from the lease with the share of the net profit derived from the lease reserved to the state as the bid variable;

(E) shall pay a royalty of five percent on oil produced from the platform if oil production that equaled or exceeded a volume of 750 barrels a day declines to less than that amount for a period of at least one calendar quarter, as certified by the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, for as long as the volume of oil produced from the platform remains less than 750 barrels a day; the provisions of this subparagraph apply to

(i) Granite Point;

(ii) Anna; and

(iii) Bruce;

(F) shall pay a royalty calculated under this subparagraph if the volume of oil produced from the platform that was certified by the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission under (E) of this paragraph later increases to 750 or more barrels a day and remains at 750 or more barrels a day for a period of at least one calendar quarter; until the royalty rate determined under this subparagraph applies, the royalty continues to be calculated under (E) of this paragraph; on and after the first day of the month following the month the increased production exceeds the period specified in this subparagraph, the royalty payable under this subparagraph is

(i) for production of at least 750 barrels a day but not more than 850 barrels a day§seven percent;

(I) may obtain the benefits of the royalty adjustments set out in (A)§(H) of this paragraph only if the commissioner determines that the reduction in production from the platform or the field is

(i) based on the average daily production during the calendar quarter based on reservoir conditions; and

(ii) not the result of short-term production declines due to mechanical or other choke-back factors, temporary shutdowns or decreased production due to environmental or facility constraints, or market conditions.

(g) The share of the net profit derived from a lease reserved to the state under (f) of this section is royalty sale proceeds for the purposes of the Alaska permanent fund under  AS 37.13.010.

(h) The commissioner may include terms in any lease imposing a minimum work commitment on the lessee. Except as provided in (m) of this section, these terms must be made public before the sale, and may include appropriate penalty provisions to take effect in the event the lessee does not fulfill the minimum work commitment. If it is demonstrated that a lease has been proven unproductive by actions of adjacent lease holders, the commissioner may set aside a work commitment. The commissioner may waive for a period not to exceed one two-year period any term of a minimum work commitment if the commissioner makes a written finding either that conditions preventing drilling or exploration were beyond the lessee's reasonable ability to foresee or control or that the lessee has demonstrated through good faith efforts an intent and ability to drill or develop the lease during the term of the waiver.

(i) [Repealed,§33 ch 4 4SSLA 2016.]

(j) The commissioner

(1) may provide for modification of royalty on individual leases, leases unitized as described in (p) of this section, leases subject to an agreement described in (s) or (t) of this section, or interests unitized under  AS 31.05

(A) to allow for production from an oil or gas field or pool if

(i) the oil or gas field or pool has been sufficiently delineated to the satisfaction of the commissioner;

(ii) the field or pool has not previously produced oil or gas for sale; and

(iii) oil or gas production from the field or pool would not otherwise be economically feasible;

(B) to prolong the economic life of an oil or gas field or pool as per barrel or barrel equivalent costs increase or as the price of oil or gas decreases, and the increase or decrease is sufficient to make future production no longer economically feasible; or

(C) to reestablish production of shut-in oil or gas that would not otherwise be economically feasible;

(2) may not grant a royalty modification unless the lessee or lessees requesting the change make a clear and convincing showing that a modification of royalty meets the requirements of this subsection and is in the best interests of the state;

(3) shall provide for an increase or decrease or other modification of the state's royalty share by a sliding scale royalty or other mechanism that shall be based on a change in the price of oil or gas and may also be based on other relevant factors such as a change in production rate, projected ultimate recovery, development costs, and operating costs;

(4) may not grant a royalty reduction for a field or pool

(A) under (1)(A) of this subsection if the royalty modification for the field or pool would establish a royalty rate of less than five percent in amount or value of the production removed or sold from a lease or leases covering the field or pool;

(B) under (1)(B) or (1)(C) of this subsection if the royalty modification for the field or pool would establish a royalty rate of less than three percent in amount or value of the production removed or sold from a lease or leases covering the field or pool;

(5) may not grant a royalty reduction under this subsection without including an explicit condition that the royalty reduction is not assignable without the prior written approval, which may not be unreasonably withheld, by the commissioner; the commissioner shall, in the preliminary and final findings and determinations, set out the conditions under which the royalty reduction may be assigned;

(6) shall require the lessee or lessees to submit, with the application for the royalty reduction, financial and technical data that demonstrate that the requirements of this subsection are met; the commissioner

(A) may require disclosure of only the financial and technical data related to development, production, and transportation of oil and gas or gas only from the field or pool that are reasonably available to the applicant; and

(B) shall keep the data confidential under  AS 38.05.035(a)(8) at the request of the lessee or lessees making application for the royalty reduction; the confidential data may be disclosed by the commissioner to legislators and to the legislative auditor and as directed by the chair or vice-chair of the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee to the director of the division of legislative finance, the permanent employees of their respective divisions who are responsible for evaluating a royalty reduction, and to agents or contractors of the legislative auditor or the legislative finance director who are engaged under contract to evaluate the royalty reduction, if they sign an appropriate confidentiality agreement;

(7) may

(A) require the lessee or lessees making application for the royalty reduction under (1)(A) of this subsection to pay for the services of an independent contractor, selected by the lessee or lessees from a list of qualified consultants compiled by the commissioner, to evaluate hydrocarbon development, production, transportation, and economics and to assist the commissioner in evaluating the application and financial and technical data; if, under this subparagraph, the commissioner requires payment for the services of an independent contractor, the total cost of the services to be paid for by the lessee or lessees may not exceed $150,000 for each application, and the commissioner shall determine the relevant scope of the work to be performed by the contractor; selection of an independent contractor under this subparagraph is not subject to  AS 36.30;

(B) with the mutual consent of the lessee or lessees making application for the royalty reduction under (1)(B) or (1)(C) of this subsection, request payment for the services of an independent contractor, selected from a list of qualified consultants to evaluate hydrocarbon development, production, transportation, and economics by the commissioner to assist the commissioner in evaluating the application and financial and technical data; if, under this subparagraph, the commissioner requires payment for the services of an independent contractor, the total cost of the services that may be paid for by the lessee or lessees may not exceed $150,000 for each application, and the commissioner shall determine the relevant scope of the work to be performed by the contractor; selection of an independent contractor under this subparagraph is not subject to  AS 36.30;

(8) shall make and publish a preliminary findings and determination on the royalty reduction application, give reasonable public notice of the preliminary findings and determination, and invite public comment on the preliminary findings and determination during a 30-day period for receipt of public comment;

(9) shall offer to appear before the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee, on a day that is not earlier than 10 days and not later than 20 days after giving public notice under (8) of this subsection, to provide the committee a review of the commissioner's preliminary findings and determination on the royalty reduction application and administrative process; if the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee accepts the commissioner's offer, the committee shall give notice of the committee's meeting to all members of the legislature;

(10) shall make copies of the preliminary findings and determination available to

(A) the presiding officer of each house of the legislature;

(B) the chairs of the legislature's standing committees on resources; and

(C) the chairs of the legislature's special committees on oil and gas, if any;

(11) shall, within 30 days after the close of the public comment period under (8) of this subsection,

(A) prepare a summary of the public response to the commissioner's preliminary findings and determination;

(B) make a final findings and determination; the commissioner's final findings and determination prepared under this subparagraph regarding a royalty reduction is final and not appealable to the court;

(C) transmit a copy of the final findings and determination to the lessee;

(D) with the applicant's consent, amend the applicant's lease or unitization agreement consistent with the commissioner's final decision; and

(E) make copies of the final findings and determination available to each person who submitted comment under (8) of this subsection and who has filed a request for the copies;

(12) is not limited by the provisions of  AS 38.05.134(3) or (f) of this section in the commissioner's determination under this subsection.

(k) The commissioner shall define all terms and adopt all regulations necessary for a reasonable understanding and evaluation of a particular bidding method before the public announcement of the terms of proposed sale employing that method.

(l) Subject to the provisions of  AS 31.05, the commissioner has discretion to enter into an agreement whereby, with the consent of the lessee, the state's royalty share of production of oil and gas or gas only may be stored or retained in storage by the lessee, or the commissioner may enter into an agreement with one or more of the affected field lease holders to trade current royalty production from a field for a like amount, kind, and quality of future production, on the condition that the state receives back its stored or traded royalty share during the first half of the estimated field life or no later than 15 years after start of production, whichever is sooner.

(m) An oil and gas lease or a gas only lease must cover a reasonably compact area not exceeding 5,760 acres, and may be for a maximum period of 10 years, except that the commissioner may issue a lease for a period not less than five years upon a finding that it is in the best interests of the state. An oil and gas lease or gas only lease shall be extended beyond its primary term if, at the end of the primary term, oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lease and for so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lease or if the lease is committed to a unit approved by the commissioner. If a lease is not automatically extended under this subsection, the commissioner may approve a one-time extension of the primary term of an oil and gas lease or gas only lease upon written application by the lessee if the commissioner finds that the extension is in the best interest of the state. A person requesting a one-time extension shall send the request to the commissioner at least 180 days before the expiration date of the primary term of the lease. The length of the primary term of the lease combined with the term of the one-time extension may not exceed a total of 10 years. The commissioner shall consider the funds expended by the lessee to explore and develop the lease, the types of work completed by or on behalf of a lessee, and any other relevant information in deciding whether to extend the lease. Notwithstanding the provisions of (h) of this section, the commissioner may condition a lease extension on posting of a performance bond by the lessee, meeting a minimum work commitment, or both. The work commitment, if required, must be expressed in terms of money to be spent or type and amount of work to be performed. A lease issued under this section covering land on which there is a well capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities does not expire because the lessee fails to produce oil or gas unless the lessee is allowed reasonable time to place the well on a producing status. Upon extension, if oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lease or the lease is committed to a unit approved by the commissioner, the commissioner may increase lease rentals so long as the increased rental rate does not exceed 150 percent of the rate for the preceding year. If the commissioner grants a one-time lease extension, upon extension, the rental for the last three years of a lease extension shall increase to $250 an acre for each year, except that, at the commissioner's discretion, the rental may be less than $250 an acre if the commissioner determines that a lessee has exercised reasonable diligence to explore and develop the lease during the primary term. If drilling, including operations such as redrilling, sidetracking, or using other means necessary to reach the originally proposed bottom hole location, has commenced on the expiration date of the primary term of the lease and is continued with reasonable diligence, the lease continues in effect until 90 days after drilling has ceased and for so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities. An oil and gas lease or a gas only lease issued under this section that is subject to termination by reason of cessation of production does not terminate if, within 60 days after production ceases, reworking or drilling operations are commenced on the land under lease and are thereafter conducted with reasonable diligence during the period of nonproduction.

(n) The commissioner may establish by regulation that after a well has been plugged and abandoned, the rental rate that was in effect during the year of abandonment is maintained for the remainder of the term. Rental is payable in advance and continues until income to the state from royalty or net profit share exceeds rental income to the state for that year. Except as provided in (m) and (w) of this section,

(1) an oil and gas or gas only lease must provide for payment to the state of rental on the following basis:

(A) for the first year, $1.00 an acre;

(B) for the second year, $1.50 an acre;

(C) for the third year, $2.00 an acre;

(D) for the fourth year, $2.50 an acre;

(E) for the fifth and following years, $3.00 an acre;

(2) if the lessee under a gas only lease demonstrates to the commissioner that the potential resources underlying the lease are reasonably estimated to be only nonconventional gas,

(A) the rental payment is $1.00 an acre until the lease expires or paying quantities of conventional oil or gas are discovered underlying the lease; and

(B) if the nonconventional gas produced will not be in direct competition with gas on which a royalty at a rate of at least 12.5 percent is payable, then the royalty share payable to the state on all production of gas from the pool attributable to that lease shall be 6.25 percent based on production delivered in pipeline quality and free of all lease expenses, including separation, cleaning, dehydration, gathering, salt water disposal, and preparation for transportation off the lease.

(o) Upon timely application as provided by regulation, the state may issue to the holder of a federal or private lease, a state shoreland lease covering land within the exterior boundaries of the federal or private lease which has been excluded on the basis of navigability or which is later administratively or judicially determined to be shoreland.  The term of such a state shoreland lease shall be the same as the term of the federal or private lease.

(p) To conserve the natural resources of all or a part of an oil or gas pool, field, or like area, the lessees and their representatives may unite with each other, or jointly or separately with others, in collectively adopting or operating under a cooperative or a unit plan of development or operation of the pool, field, or like area, or a part of it, when determined and certified by the commissioner to be necessary or advisable in the public interest. The commissioner may, with the consent of the holders of leases involved, establish, change, or revoke drilling, producing, and royalty requirements of the leases and adopt regulations with reference to the leases, with like consent on the part of the lessees, in connection with the institution and operation of a cooperative or unit plan as the commissioner determines necessary or proper to secure the proper protection of the public interest. The commissioner may not reduce royalty on leases in connection with a cooperative or unit plan except as provided in (j) of this section. The commissioner may require a lease issued under this section to contain a provision requiring the lessee to operate under a reasonable cooperative or unit plan, and may prescribe a plan under which the lessee must operate. The plan must adequately protect all parties in interest, including the state.

(q) A plan authorized by (p) of this section, which includes land owned by the state, may contain a provision vesting the commissioner, or a person, committee, or state agency, with authority to modify from time to time the rate of prospecting and development and the quantity and rate of production under the plan.  All leases operated under a plan approved or prescribed by the commissioner are excepted in determining holdings or control under  AS 38.05.140.  The provisions of this section concerning cooperative or unit plans are in addition to and do not affect  AS 31.05.

(r) Producing acreage on a known geologic structure of a producing oil or gas field is excluded from chargeability as against the acreage limitation provisions of  AS 38.05.140.

(s) When separate tracts cannot be individually developed and operated in conformity with an established well-spacing or development program, a lease, or a portion of a lease, may be pooled with other land, whether or not owned by the state, under a communitization or drilling agreement providing for an apportionment of production or royalties among the separate tracts of land comprising the drilling or spacing unit when determined by the commissioner to be in the public interest. Operations or production under the agreement are considered as operations or production as to each lease committed to the agreement.  The commissioner may not reduce royalty on leases in connection with a communitization or drilling agreement except as provided in (j) of this section.

(t) The commissioner may prescribe conditions and approve, on conditions, drilling, or development contracts made by one or more lessees of oil or gas leases, with one or more persons, when, in the discretion of the commissioner, the conservation of natural resources or the public convenience or necessity requires it or the interests of the state are best served. All leases operated under approved drilling or development contracts and interests under them, are excepted in determining holding or control under  AS 38.05.140.  The commissioner may not reduce royalty on a lease or leases that are subject to a drilling or development contract except as provided in (j) of this section.

(u) To avoid waste or to promote conservation of natural resources, the commissioner may authorize the subsurface storage of oil or gas, whether or not produced from state land, in land leased or subject to lease under this section. This authorization may provide for the payment of a storage fee or rental on the stored oil or gas, or, instead of the fee or rental, for a royalty other than that prescribed in the lease when the stored oil or gas is produced in conjunction with oil or gas not previously produced. A lease on which storage is so authorized shall be extended at least for the period of storage and so long thereafter as oil or gas not previously produced is produced in paying quantities. Notwithstanding the authorization for payments under this subsection, when requested by a lessee, the commissioner shall exempt a gas storage facility that qualifies for a tax credit under  AS 43.20.046 from any payment described in this subsection for the periods described in this subsection. The exemption is available for the calendar year in which the facility commences commercial operation and for each of the nine calendar years immediately following the first year of commercial operation; however, an exemption is not applicable for the calendar year after the facility ceases commercial operation or for any subsequent calendar year. The lessee shall provide the commissioner with any information the commissioner requests to determine if the exemption applies. The information related to state land leased for a gas storage facility under this subsection is public information and may be furnished to the Regulatory Commission of Alaska. On request, the commissioner shall provide the name of each person using state land leased for a gas storage facility under this chapter, the years for which an exemption was granted, and the amount of the exemption. Gas withdrawn from a gas storage facility regulated under  AS 42.05 is considered to be non-native gas and is not considered to be produced and subject to royalty until all non-native gas injected into the gas storage facility has been withdrawn from the gas storage facility. A person receiving an exemption for a payment under this section that contracts to store gas for a utility regulated under  AS 42.05 shall reduce the storage price to reflect the value of the exemption. In this subsection, "ceases commercial operation," "commences commercial operation," "gas storage facility," and "non-native gas" have the meanings given in  AS 31.05.032.

(v)    [Repealed,§36 ch 94 SLA 1980.]

(w) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, land that was subject to a best interest finding issued within the previous 10 years may be, at the discretion of the commissioner, immediately offered for lease, under regulations adopted by the commissioner, upon terms appearing most advantageous to the state; however, noncompetitive leasing is prohibited. The commissioner shall establish a royalty determined to be in the public interest but not less than 12 1/2 percent. A lease must provide for payment to the state of rental but need not adhere to the rental schedule in (n) of this section nor to the 5,760-acres-per-lease limitation in (m) of this section. The lease term may not exceed 10 years, except as provided in (o) of this section.

(x) A lessee conducting or permitting any exploration for, or development or production of, oil or gas on state land shall provide the commissioner access to all noninterpretive data obtained from that lease and shall provide copies of that data, as the commissioner may request.  The confidentiality provisions of  AS 38.05.035 apply to the information obtained under this subsection.

(y) A noncompetitive lease existing at October 10, 1978, shall be extended for a period of two years and so long thereafter as oil and gas is produced in paying quantities.  A noncompetitive lease extended under this subsection is subject to the regulations in force at the expiration of the initial five-year term of the lease.  No extension may be granted, however, unless within a period of 90 days before the expiration date an application for extension is filed by the record title holder or an assignee whose assignment has been filed for approval, or an operator whose operating agreement has been filed for approval.

(z) No leases may be issued under this section without the inclusion of the following language "The landowners' royalty share of the unit production allocated to each separately owned tract shall be regarded as royalty to be distributed to and among, or the proceeds of it paid to, the landowners, free and clear of all unit expense and free of any lien for it." Leases issued in violation of this subsection shall, for all purposes, be construed as containing the language required by this subsection.

(aa) Within 90 days after the written request of a lessee of a lease issued under this section or of a lessee of federal land from which the state is entitled under applicable federal law to receive a share of the royalty on gas production, the commissioner shall enter into an agreement with the lessee to use or accept, as the value of the state's royalty share of gas production, the price for the gas established in the contract between the lessee and a gas or electric utility sold by the lessee under the contract or the transfer price between the lessee and a gas or electric utility for a transfer by the lessee under an order establishing the transfer price

(1) but only if the primary function of the utility with which the lessee has entered into the contract or transfer is to provide, either directly or by selling at wholesale to another utility, gas or electricity to the general public, including residential consumers, within the utilities' service areas, and the utility with which the lessee has entered into

(A) the contract is not an affiliated interest, as that term is defined in  AS 42.05.990, with the lessee or with a subsequent purchaser of more than 10 percent of the utility's gas or electricity; or

(B) the transfer is an affiliated interest, as that term is defined in  AS 42.05.990, and the transfer price between the lessee and the utility is established by an order of the Regulatory Commission of Alaska; and

(2) unless the commissioner makes a written finding, based on clear and convincing evidence, that

(A) the contract price or transfer price is unreasonably low;

(B) the prospective reduction in royalty receipts would not be balanced by increased benefits to in-state gas and electric consumers;

(C) the lessee and the utility are related in management, ownership, or other aspect and, in the case of a transfer price, that relationship is not regulated under  AS 42.05; and

(D) the contract price or transfer price is not in the best interest of the state.

(bb) In (aa) and (ee) of this section,

(1) "gas or electric utility" includes an electric cooperative organized under  AS 10.25, a municipal utility, and a gas or electric utility regulated under  AS 42.05; if the contract gas is transmitted to consumers through a pipeline and the gas utility either owns the pipeline or is related in ownership to the owner of the pipeline, then the gas utility qualifies as a "gas or electric utility" within the meaning of this paragraph only if it is bound or agrees to be bound by the covenants set out in  AS 38.35.120 or  38.35.121, as applicable;

(2) "manufacturer of agricultural chemicals" means a person that is a business entity primarily engaging in the manufacturing of nitrogenous and phosphatic based fertilizers, mixed fertilizers, pesticides, and similar chemicals for agricultural purposes;

(3) "price for the gas established in the contract" includes tax reimbursement amounts, deliverability and other charges, and other forms of consideration paid by the gas or electric utility or by the manufacturer of agricultural chemicals, as appropriate, under the contract;

(4) "state's royalty share of gas production"

(A) includes payments on federal leases made to the state under  30 U.S.C. 191;

(B) does not include the state's royalty share of gas production from land patented to the state under

(i) P.L. 84-830, 70 Stat. 709 (Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act);

(ii) 38 Stat. 1214 (Act of March 4, 1915); or

(iii) 43 U.S.C. 1635 in settlement of the claims of the state under 38 Stat. 1214.

(cc) The provisions of (aa), (ee), and (jj) of this section do not prohibit the commissioner from accepting any payment on a federal lease tendered by the federal agency responsible for determination and transmittal of the payment to the state under  30 U.S.C. 191 or otherwise due the state as the state's royalty share of gas production or the state's royalty share of oil production irrespective of the state's acceptance of an amount that is different than the amount due under the lease for purposes of determining royalty share on oil and gas production under that subsection.

(dd) A lessee is eligible for the royalty in (f)(5) of this section only if production of oil or gas for sale begins from the eligible field before January 1, 2004. However, if the state or an agency of the state is a party to a suit, other than a suit brought by the lessee or agent of the lessee, and if the suit challenges (f)(5) of this section or  AS 31.05.030(i) or an act under (f)(5) of this section or  AS 31.05.030(i), the January 1, 2004, deadline is extended by the number of days the state or agency of the state is a party to the suit, including any appeals.

(ee) For a contract that is entered into on or after September 9, 2003, within 90 days after the written request of a lessee of a lease issued under this section or of a lessee of federal land from which the state is entitled under applicable federal law to receive a share of the royalty on gas production, in order to establish the value of the state's royalty share of gas production sold by the lessee under the contract, the commissioner may enter into an agreement with the lessee to use or accept as a price for the gas an amount that is not less than the price established in the contract between the lessee and a manufacturer of agricultural chemicals, not to exceed the amount that would otherwise be due under the lease. The commissioner may enter into the agreement if it is in the best interest of the state

(1) only if the primary function of the manufacturer is to engage in the production of a value-added product, and the manufacturer with which the lessee has entered into the contract is not affiliated with the lessee or with a subsequent purchaser of more than 10 percent of the manufacturer's value-added product; for purposes of this paragraph, the parties to a contract or purchase are affiliated if, in the judgment of the commissioner, one of the parties to the contract or purchase exercises substantial influence over the policies and actions of the other as evidenced by relationship based on common ownership or family interest or by action taken in concert without regard to whether that influence is based upon stockholdings, stockholders, officers, or directors;

(2) unless the commissioner makes a written finding, based on clear and convincing evidence, that

(A) the contract price is unreasonably low; or

(B) the prospective reduction in royalty receipts would not be balanced by employment opportunities or other tangible benefits to the state.

(ff) The provisions of this section that authorize oil and gas leases also apply to authorize the commissioner to issue leases for the production of gas only, subject to the following:

(1) in authorizing and managing leases under this subsection, the terms "oil and gas" or "oil or gas" as they are used in this chapter may be read and applied as appropriate as referring to gas only;

(2) when a lease is authorized as a gas only lease, the lease does not give the lessee the right to produce oil; if a well drilling for gas under a gas only lease authorized by this subsection penetrates a formation capable of producing oil, the owner or operator

(A) shall notify the department and the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission; and

(B) may not conduct further operations in the drilled well until the facility complies with all applicable laws and regulations relating to oil and gas exploration and production; however, this subparagraph does not prevent the owner or operator from conducting activities that may be required by the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to plug, plug-back, or abandon a well;

(3) the provisions of this subsection do not apply to authorize a lease for the recovery of nonconventional gas on land that is held under an existing coal lease entered into under  AS 38.05.150 that has an active permit for exploration or mining unless the lessee under this subsection is also the lessee under  AS 38.05.150 of that land.

(gg) For an activity or operation related to the extraction of coal bed methane,

(1) for which the department by regulation requires submission and approval of a plan of operations before activities or operations may be undertaken, the director shall, as a condition for determining a bond requested under  AS 38.05.130, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, review the plan of operations to determine if use of the owner's land is reasonably necessary to extract the coal bed methane; a bond determined under  AS 38.05.130 and this paragraph may, at the discretion of the director, be imposed against a statewide bond that has been posted by the person initiating the request for determination of the bond if the statewide bond remains in effect, and an additional bond is not required;

(2) before approving operations for the development of coal bed methane under  AS 38.05.134,  38.05.177, or this section, the director shall ensure that the approval is conditioned upon reasonable and appropriate

(A) setbacks governing the placement by the operator of compressor stations; setbacks approved under this subparagraph must be determined with reference to the population density and general character of the parcels surrounding the proposed compressor station site; and

(B) measures to mitigate the noise of compressors, engines, and other noise generating equipment operated by the operator on the lease or license; measures approved under this subparagraph must be determined with reference to the population density and general character of the parcels surrounding the proposed compressor, engine, or other noise-generating equipment.

(hh) Notwithstanding (j) of this section, the commissioner may propose modification to a lease from which a lessee has committed gas from that lease to a North Slope natural gas project. A modification may be made under this subsection only after the commissioner makes the written determination under subsection (ii) of this section that the lease may be modified. If a modification is made, the modification shall be in effect during the initial project term that has acquired the major permits required for the work plan and budget considered by the commissioner in the written determination under subsection (ii) of this section. A modification under this subsection may

(1) relate to switching between taking the state's royalty gas in value and in kind to ensure that the lessee, the state, or another person shall bear proportionate costs for treatment, transportation, and liquefaction to the state's royalty gas or gas delivered to the state under  AS 43.55.014, and the state's actions do not unreasonably interfere with the long-term marketing of natural gas by the lessee, the state, or another person;

(2) provide a method for establishing a fair market value for each component of the state's royalty gas and appropriate adjustments to reflect fair market deductions for reasonable costs for treatment, transportation, and liquefaction for the state's royalty gas from the North Slope to the destination market; in this paragraph, "reasonable costs for treatment, transportation, and liquefaction" may not be greater than actual costs;

(3) modify net profit shares for oil and gas and sliding scale royalty rates for gas by establishing fixed royalty rates that yield a value to the state that the commissioner determines to be not less than the value the state would have received under the terms of the lease before a modification under this subsection.

(ii) Before making a modification to a lease under (hh) of this section, the commissioner shall make a written determination that the lease may be modified. The determination by the commissioner must be based on a clear and convincing showing by the lessee that

(1) the modification

(A) is in the best interests of the state; and

(B) will materially improve the likelihood of a successful North Slope natural gas project;

(2) a North Slope natural gas project has sufficient

(A) financial commitment for a work plan and budget necessary to support major permits and regulatory filings required by state and federal agencies; and

(B) commitment of gas by lessees;

(3) the lease will produce hydrocarbons that will be transported on a North Slope natural gas project during the initial project term; and

(4) the lessee or an affiliate of the lessee has offered to purchase, dispose of, or market the state's royalty gas taken in kind and gas delivered to the state under  AS 43.55.014 on the same or substantially similar terms as the lessee or an affiliate of the lessee sells, disposes of, or markets the lessee's gas.

(jj) Upon written request of a lessee of a lease issued under this section or of a lessee of federal land from which the state is entitled to receive a share of the royalty on oil production, the commissioner may enter into an agreement with the lessee to accept, as a value for the state's royalty share of oil production sold to an in-state refiner, an amount that is not less than the price established in a contract between the lessee and the in-state refiner but not exceeding the amount that would otherwise be due under the lease. This subsection applies to a contract entered into after December 31, 2014. The commissioner shall respond to a request received under this subsection within 90 days after the receipt of the request by the department. The commissioner may enter into an agreement under this subsection if

(1) the commissioner issues a written finding that

(A) the agreement is in the best interest of the state;

(B) the parties to the contract between the lessee and the in-state refiner are not affiliated under (2) of this subsection; and

(C) based on clear and convincing evidence,

(i) the contract price is not unreasonably low; and

(ii) the prospective reduction in royalty receipts will be balanced by employment opportunities or other tangible benefits to the state; and

(2) the primary function of the in-state refiner's contracting with the lessee is to engage in the manufacture of refined petroleum products in the state, and the in-state refiner is not affiliated with the lessee or with a subsequent purchaser of more than 10 percent of the in-state refiner's product; the parties to a contract or purchase are affiliated if, in the judgment of the commissioner, one of the parties to the contract or purchase exercises substantial influence over the policies and actions of the other as evidenced by a relationship based on common ownership or family interest or by action taken in concert whether or not that influence is based on stockholdings, stockholders, officers, or directors.

(kk) In (cc) and (jj) of this section,

(1) "in-state refiner" means a person engaged in the manufacture of refined petroleum products in the state;

(2) "price established in a contract between the lessee and the in-state refiner" includes tax reimbursement amounts, deliverability and other charges, and other forms of consideration paid by the in-state refiner, as appropriate, under the contract;

(3) "state's royalty share of oil production" includes payments on federal leases made to the state under  30 U.S.C. 191.

(ll) For a contract that is entered into on or after July 1, 2017, within 90 days after the written request of a lessee of a lease issued under this section, in order to establish the value of the state's royalty share of gas production sold by the lessee under the contract, the commissioner may enter into an agreement with the lessee to use or accept as a price for the gas an amount that is not less than the price established in the contract between the lessee and an in-state processing facility whose primary function is the manufacturing and sale of urea, ammonia, or gas-to- liquid products to third parties in arm's length transactions, not to exceed the amount that would otherwise be due under the lease. The commissioner may enter into an agreement under this subsection if

(1) the commissioner makes a written finding that

(A) it is in the best interest of the state; and

(B) based on clear and convincing evidence, the contract price is not unreasonably low;

(2) the primary function of the in-state processing facility is to engage in the production of urea, ammonia, or gas-to-liquid products, and the lessee is not affiliated either with an owner of the in-state processing facility or with a subsequent purchaser of more than 10 percent of the urea, ammonia, or gas-to-liquid products produced by the processing facility; for purposes of this paragraph, the parties are affiliated if, in the judgment of the commissioner, one of the parties exercises substantial influence over the policies and actions of the other as evidenced by a relationship based on common ownership or family interest or by action taken in concert without regard to whether that influence is based on stockholdings, stockholders, officers, or directors; in this paragraph, "gas-to-liquid product" means a liquid produced by a processing facility that combines, breaks up, or rearranges atoms present in natural gas, but does not include liquefied natural gas; and

(3) the agreement requires, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the lessee to

(A) hire qualified residents from throughout the state for management, engineering, construction, operation, maintenance, and other positions;

(B) establish hiring facilities in the state or use existing hiring facilities in the state; and

(C) use, as far as practicable, the job centers and associated services operated by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development and an Internet-based labor exchange system operated by the state.

###### Sec. 38.05.181.   Geothermal resources.

(a) The commissioner may, under regulations adopted by the commissioner, grant prospecting permits and leases to a qualified person to explore for, develop, or use geothermal resources.  When title to the surface parcel is held by a person other than the state, that person shall have a preferential right to a geothermal prospecting permit or lease for the area underlying the surface parcel.  The surface owner must exercise the preference right within 30 days after receiving notice of the application for a permit, or by agreeing to meet the terms of a bid within 60 days after receiving notice of the acceptance of the bid for a lease.

(b) The commissioner may designate a geothermal area or portion of it a competitive geothermal area.  A designation as a competitive geothermal area must be on the basis of substantial geologic indications of geothermal resources or on the basis of competitive interest in geothermal resources of the area.

(c) On state land that has not been declared a competitive geothermal area or withdrawn from geothermal prospecting, the commissioner may issue a prospecting permit to the first qualified applicant. The permit conveys an exclusive right, for a period of two years, to prospect for geothermal resources on state land included under the permit.  The commissioner has discretion to renew the permit for an additional one-year term.  A holder of a prospecting permit has the right, upon the showing of a discovery of geothermal resources in commercial quantities and the submission of a development plan acceptable to the commissioner, to convert the permit to a noncompetitive lease at a royalty rate under (g) of this section. The conversion privilege must be exercised not later than 30 days after the expiration of the permit.  If the land included within the permit is designated a competitive geothermal area during the permit term, the permittee must apply for a noncompetitive lease within 30 days after notification of the designation or forfeit the conversion privileges and the exclusive right to prospect.

(d) On state land that is designated a competitive geothermal area and is not subject to an existing prospecting permit, the commissioner may issue geothermal leases to the highest bidder by competitive bidding procedures established by regulations adopted by the commissioner.  At the discretion of the commissioner, competitive lease sales may be by oral or sealed bid, on the basis of a cash bonus, profit share, or royalty share.

(e) Prospecting permits and geothermal leases granted under this section must, except in the case of parcels subject to a preference right under (b) of this section, be issued for at least 40 acres but not more than 2,560 acres.  A person may not own, or hold an interest in, geothermal leases covering more than 51,200 acres.  However, geothermal leases in commercial production, individually or under a unit operation or well spacing or pooling arrangement, do not count against the acreage limitation.  All prospecting permits and geothermal leases are subject to an annual rental, payable in advance, of $3 per acre. The rental for a year shall be credited against royalties accruing for that year.

(f) A geothermal lease shall be issued for a primary term of 10 years and may be renewed for an additional term of five years if the lessee is actively engaged in drilling operations. A geothermal lease is valid for the duration of commercial production.  Beginning 20 years after the initiation of commercial production and at 10-year intervals thereafter, the commissioner may renegotiate the rentals and royalties due on a geothermal lease.

(g) Each geothermal lease shall be conditioned upon payment by the lessee of a royalty of 1.75 percent of the gross revenues derived from the production, sale, or use of geothermal resources under the lease during the first 10 years immediately following the date the geothermal resource first generates gross income and 3.5 percent of the gross revenues derived from the production, sale, or use of geothermal resources under the lease after that first 10-year period. Royalties may be taken in kind rather than in value if the commissioner determines that taking in kind would be in the best interest of the state.

(h) Regulations adopted by the commissioner to implement this section shall be adopted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (AS 44.62).

###### Sec. 38.05.182.   Royalty on natural resources.

(a) Any royalty provided for in AS 38.05.135§38.05.181 may be taken in kind rather than in money if the commissioner determines that the taking in kind would be in the best interest of the state. However, royalties on oil and gas shall be taken in kind unless the commissioner determines that the taking in money would be in the best interest of the state.

(b) The commissioner shall submit a determination to take royalty in money to the legislature at the first opportunity during a current session or, if the legislature is not in session, at the next regular session.  The legislature, within 60 days or by the adjournment of the session, whichever comes sooner, may revoke the determination by concurrent resolution.

###### Sec. 38.05.183.   Sale of royalty.

(a) The sale, exchange, or other disposal of a mineral obtained by the state as a royalty under AS 38.05.182, the sale, exchange, or other disposal in whole or in part of a right to receive future mineral production under a state lease under this chapter, or the sale, exchange, or other disposal of gas delivered to the state under AS 43.55.014(b) shall be by competitive bid and the sale, exchange, or other disposal made to the highest responsible bidder, except that competitive bidding is not required when the commissioner, after prior written notice to the Alaska Royalty Oil and Gas Development Advisory Board under AS 38.06.050, determines that the best interest of the state does not require it or that no competition exists.

(b) When competitive bids are required, the commissioner, after prior written notice to the Alaska Royalty Oil and Gas Development Advisory Board, may reject all bids on a determination that because of the amount of the bids, the lack of responsibility on the part of the bidders, or for reasons consistent with the criteria set out in AS 38.06.070, the acceptance of the bids would not be in the best interest of the state.

(c) If the commissioner determines that a sale, exchange, or other disposal of a mineral obtained by the state as a royalty under AS 38.05.182, of a right to receive future mineral production under a state lease under this chapter, or of gas delivered to the state under AS 43.55.014(b) shall be made otherwise than by competitive bid, and the Alaska Royalty Oil and Gas Development Advisory Board has been notified in writing of that determination, the commissioner shall make public in writing the specific findings and conclusions on which that determination is based.

(d) Oil or gas taken in kind by the state as its royalty share or gas delivered to the state under AS 43.55.014(b) may not be sold or otherwise disposed of for export from the state until the commissioner determines that the oil or gas is surplus to the present and projected intrastate domestic and industrial needs. The commissioner shall make public, in writing, the specific findings and reasons on which the determination is based.

(e) When a sale, exchange, or other disposal of oil or gas taken in kind by the state as its royalty share, or a sale, exchange, or other disposal in whole or in part of a right to receive future royalty oil or gas, under a state lease under this chapter is made other than by competitive bid, or when a sale, exchange, or other disposal of gas delivered to the state under AS 43.55.014(b) is made other than by competitive bid, the sale, exchange, or other disposal shall be awarded by the commissioner to the prospective buyer whose proposal offers the maximum benefits to citizens of the state. The commissioner shall consider

(1) the cash value offered;

(2) the projected effects of the sale, exchange, or other disposal on the economy of the state;

(3) the projected benefits of refining or processing the oil or gas in the state;

(4) the ability of the prospective buyer to provide refined products or by-products for distribution and sale in the state with price or supply benefits to the citizens of the state; and

(5) the criteria listed in AS 38.06.070(a).

(f) The commissioner may not enter into a contract for the sale of royalty oil unless the contract provides that any material amendment to the contract that appreciably reduces the consideration received by the state requires prior approval of the legislature.

(g) AS 38.05.035(e) does not apply to a sale, exchange, or other disposal of oil or gas under this section.

(h) Upon legislative approval, the commissioner may enter into a contract to sell royalty gas taken in kind by the state to a gas or electric utility at a negotiated price for the gas if the commissioner, after considering the consumer benefits, other benefits, and detriments of the sale, makes a written finding that the sale is in the best interest of the state. In this subsection,

(1) "gas or electric utility" has the meaning given in AS 38.05.180(bb);

(2) "royalty gas taken in kind by the state" does not include royalty gas taken in kind by the state from gas production on land patented to the state under

(A) P.L. 84-830, 70 Stat. 709 (Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act);

(B) 38 Stat. 1214 (Act of March 4, 1915); or

(C) 43 U.S.C. 1635 in settlement of the claims of the state under 38 Stat. 1214.

###### Sec. 38.05.184.   Limitation on oil and gas leases in Kachemak Bay.

(a) The legislature finds that Kachemak Bay is an area of extraordinary abundance and diversity of marine life that has provided, and will continue to provide in the future, a basis for one of the state's most important commercial fisheries; that recent information discloses that even minute quantities of oil released into the marine environment may be harmful to the larval forms of crabs and other marine life and that the existence of gyral currents within the bay may increase the likelihood of oil coming into contact with these valuable commercial fish and shellfish species; and that therefore oil and gas development in the bay, at this time, presents an undue hazard to this valuable state renewable resource.

(b) No additional oil or gas leases may be issued by the department or any other state agency for the exploration for or the development or production of oil and gas on state-owned land and waters seaward of the mean higher high water line, beginning at Anchor Point; then around the perimeter of Kachemak Bay, to Point Pogibshi; then west to the three mile limit of state land and waters; then north to a point three miles west of Anchor Point; then east to the mean higher high water line of Anchor Point, the point of beginning.

#### Article 8. Mining Rights.

###### Sec. 38.05.185.   Generally.

(a) The acquisition and continuance of rights in and to deposits on state land of minerals, which on January 3, 1959, were subject to location under the mining laws of the United States, shall be governed by AS 38.05.185§38.05.275. Nothing in AS 38.05.185§38.05.275 affects the law pertaining to the acquisition of rights to mineral deposits owned by any other person or government. The director, with the approval of the commissioner, shall determine that land from which mineral deposits may be mined only under lease, and, subject to the limitations of AS 38.05.300, that land that shall be closed to location under AS 38.05.185§38.05.275. State land may not be closed to location under AS 38.05.185§38.05.275 except as provided in AS 38.05.300 and unless the commissioner makes a finding that mining would be incompatible with significant surface uses on the state land. State land may not be restricted to mining under lease unless the commissioner determines that potential use conflicts on the state land require that mining be allowed only under written leases issued under AS 38.05.205 or the commissioner has determined that the land was mineral in character at the time of state selection. The determinations required under this subsection shall be made in compliance with land classification orders and land use plans developed under AS 38.05.300.

(b) The failure on the part of a mining lessee or a locator to comply strictly with AS 38.05.185§38.05.275 and regulations adopted under those sections does not invalidate the rights of a mining lessee or a locator if it appears to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the mining lessee or the locator complied as nearly as possible under the circumstances of the case, and that no conflicting rights are asserted by any other person.

(c) Unless otherwise provided, the usages and interpretations applicable to the mining laws of the United States as supplemented by state law apply to AS 38.05.185§38.05.275.

###### Sec. 38.05.190.   Qualifications.

(a) Except as provided in (b) of this section, exploration and mining rights under AS 38.05.185§38.05.275 may be acquired or held only by

(1) citizens of the United States at least 18 years of age;

(2) legal guardians, conservators, or trustees of citizens of the United States under 18 years of age or citizens of the United States that are incapacitated adults under AS 13.26 on behalf of the citizens;

(3) individuals at least 18 years of age who have declared their intention to become citizens of the United States;

(4) aliens at least 18 years of age if the laws of their country grant like privileges to citizens of the United States;

(5) corporations, limited liability companies, or other entities that are organized under the laws of the United States or of any state or territory of the United States and qualified to do business in this state;

(6)  trusts that are registered in this state under AS 13.36 and for which at least one trustee is a person described in (1)§(5) of this subsection; or

(7) associations of persons described in (1)§(6) of this subsection.

(b) An unqualified person who acquires an interest in exploration or mining rights by conveyance or operation of law, or a person who was qualified under (a) of this section at the time of location or acquisition of exploration or mining rights and later becomes unqualified, may either become qualified or transfer the interest to a qualified person within 90 days from the date the department sends written notice under (c) of this section. If the unqualified person does not cure the defect or transfer the interest to a qualified person, the department may declare the interest void under (d) of this section.

(c) If the department learns that an unqualified person has acquired an interest in exploration or mining rights through conveyance or operation of law, the department shall send written notice to the owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the most recent address on file with the department, stating that the interest will be void if the unqualified person does not cure the defect or transfer the interest within 90 days. The department may send an additional copy of the notice by regular mail.

(d) The department may declare void the exploration or mining interest of a person who fails to comply with (b) of this section but may not declare the interest void if the person becomes qualified under (e) of this section.

(e) An unqualified person may cure a defect in qualification, before or after receiving notice under (c) of this section, by becoming qualified or transferring the person's interest to a qualified person. A person may not cure a defect in qualification for an exploration or mining interest that has been declared void under (d) of this section.

(f) If an unqualified person fails to cure a defect in qualification within 90 days after the department sends written notice under (c) of this section, the department may declare the exploration or mining interest void and the affected land becomes open to location. A third party may not locate on the affected land or file a judicial action to declare the exploration or mining interest invalid within those 90 days.

(g) In this section, "qualified to do business in this state" means holding a certificate issued by the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development necessary to conduct business in the state.

###### Sec. 38.05.195.   Mining claims.

(a) Rights to deposits of minerals subject to AS 38.05.185§38.05.275 in or on state land that is open to claim staking may be acquired by discovery, location, and recording as prescribed in AS 38.05.185§38.05.275. The locator has the exclusive right of possession and extraction of the minerals subject to AS 38.05.185§38.05.275 lying within the boundaries of the claim.

(b) The locator may locate a claim using one of the following methods:

(1) a locator may locate a claim based on the ground location of a quarter section or quarter-quarter section of a township on a rectangular survey system approved by the commissioner; a claim established in this manner may be known as a meridian, township, range, section, and claim system location, or MTRSC location; a locator using the MTRSC system to locate a claim shall in good faith mark the corners of a location as closely as practical to the existing quarter section or quarter-quarter section of the rectangular survey system approved by the commissioner; the corners marked on the ground of a claim established in accordance with this paragraph and regulations of the commissioner control in the event of a conflict over boundaries for the quarter section or quarter-quarter section on the protracted or actual survey approved by the commissioner; a valid MTRSC location establishes rights to deposits of minerals in or on all state land within the quarter section or quarter-quarter section that is open to claim staking at the time of location; or

(2) a locator may locate a claim based on the staking of a ground location in which the claim may not exceed 1,320 feet in its longest dimension; the boundaries of a claim based on staking and located after January 1, 1985, shall run in the four cardinal directions unless the claim is a fractional claim or the commissioner determines that staking in compliance with this paragraph is impractical because of local topography or because of the location of other claims; a claim established in this manner may be known as a non-MTRSC location.

(c) A location's corners shall be distinctly marked on the ground in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, and a notice of location shall be attached to a monument at the claim's northeast corner in the manner and containing the information required by the commissioner. Within 45 days after the date of attaching the notice of location on the monument, the locator shall record a certificate of location in the recording district where the claim is located. The certificate of location must contain the information required by the commissioner.

(d) Locations may be amended in the manner and with the effect prescribed in AS 38.05.200.

###### Sec. 38.05.200.   Changes in locations and amended notices.

Notices may be amended at any time and monuments changed to correspond with the amended location but a change may not be made that interferes with the rights of others.  Whenever monuments are changed or an error is made in the notice or in the certificate of location, an amended certificate of location shall be recorded in the same manner and with the same effect as the original certificate.

###### Sec. 38.05.205.   Mining leasing.

(a) Prior discovery, location, and recording shall initiate prior rights to mineral deposits subject to  AS 38.05.185§ 38.05.275 in or on state land, other than submerged land, which is open to mining leasing. Locations shall be made and certificates of location recorded in accordance with  AS 38.05.195.  If the located land is available only for leasing, the director shall publish in a paper of general circulation in the area of the location, notice of the recording of the location and notice that a mineral lease will be issued.  The notice may be combined with notices of locations either in the same general area or statewide.  Unless a conflicting location exists, no later than two weeks after publication of the notice, an application form for a mining lease shall be mailed to the locator by the director.  A lease application shall be filed with the director by the locator within 90 days after receipt of the form.  If the located land is not available for leasing, notice shall be given the locator by the director and the locator's prior rights shall terminate.  A mining lessee has the exclusive rights of possession and extraction of all minerals subject to  AS 38.05.185§ 38.05.275 lying within the boundaries of the lease or location.  Mining leases may be issued for one location or for a group of contiguous locations held in common.  Minerals may not be mined and marketed or used until a lease is issued, except for limited amounts necessary for sampling or testing.

(b)    [Repealed,§10 ch 101 SLA 1989.]

(c) A mining lease shall be for any period up to 55 years, and is renewable if requirements for the lease remain satisfied. Annual rental and production royalties shall be paid as required under  AS 38.05.211 and  38.05.212. A valid mining claim located and held under  AS 38.05.195 may be converted to a lease at any time upon application by the owner, and issuance by the commissioner. Rights granted by a mining lease may not be exercised until the lease has been filed for record in the recording district where the land is located.

###### Sec. 38.05.207.   Production license. [Repealed,§19 ch 56 SLA 1997.]

###### Sec. 38.05.210.   Annual labor.

(a) Labor shall be performed or improvements made annually on or for the benefit or development of each mining claim, leasehold location, and mining lease on state land, except that, where adjacent claims, leasehold locations, or mining leases are held in common, including adjacent federal or private mineral interests held in common, the expenditure may be made on or for the benefit of any one claim, leasehold location, mining lease, or mineral interest. The commissioner shall establish the date of the commencement of the year during which the labor or improvements are to be performed. Labor shall be performed at the following annual rates: (1) $100 for each claim, leasehold location, or lease if the claim, leasehold location, or lease is a quarter-quarter section MTRSC claim, leasehold location, or lease; (2) $400 for each quarter section MTRSC claim, leasehold location, or lease; and (3) $100 for each partial or whole 40 acres of each mining claim, leasehold location, or lease not established using the MTRSC system. If more work is performed than is required by this section to be performed in any one year, the excess value may be applied against labor required to be done during the subsequent year or years, for as many as four years. For not more than five consecutive years, instead of performing annual labor, the holder of a claim, leasehold location, or mining lease may make a cash payment to the state equal to the value of the labor required by this subsection.

(b) During the year in which annual labor is required or within 90 days after the close of that year, the owner of the mining claim, leasehold location, or mining lease, or some other person having knowledge of the facts, shall record with the recorder of the district in which the claim, leasehold location, or mining lease is located a signed statement of annual labor. The individual who signs the statement shall certify that, to the best of the individual's knowledge, the information contained in the statement is true and correct. The statement must include the following information:

(1)  the assessment work year for which the statement is being recorded;

(2) the name of and land administration number assigned by the department for each mining claim, leasehold location, or mining lease benefited by the labor;

(3) each meridian, township, range, and section in which a mining claim, leasehold location, or mining lease is located;

(4) the recording district in which the mining claim, leasehold location, or mining lease is located;

(5) the total amount of work required for the assessment work year for a mining claim, leasehold location, or mining lease described in the statement;

(6) a description of the labor performed during the assessment work year;

(7) the value of

(A) the labor performed during the assessment work year;

(B) any excess labor value from a previous year applied against the labor required; or

(6) "qualified expert" means an individual qualified by education or experience to conduct geological, geochemical, or geophysical surveys, as the case may be.

###### Sec. 38.05.245.   Prospecting sites.

(a) Before the discovery of valuable minerals, an exclusive right to prospect by geophysical, geochemical, and similar methods may be acquired by establishing a prospecting site in accordance with the MTRSC system and regulations prescribed by the commissioner. A certificate of location shall be recorded in the recording district where the prospecting site is located within 45 days after posting the notice of location. The locator of a prospecting site has the exclusive right to stake mining claims or leasehold locations within the boundaries of the site. In this subsection, "MTRSC system" means the system described in AS 38.05.195(b)(1) based on the ground location of a complete quarter section or quarter-quarter section of a township.

(b) A prospecting site location may not include within its exterior boundaries, nor shall its boundaries be coincident with more than one boundary of any mining claim, mining leasehold location, or land under a mining lease, unless the locator of the prospecting site is also the owner, optionee, or lessee of said mining property.  If such mining property or area is so included or bounded, the prospecting site is void.

(c) A prospecting site remains in effect for two years after the notice of location is attached to a monument at the northeast corner of the site if the one-time rental payment is made within 45 days of location and the work requirements are met. The two-year term begins on the date the notice of location is attached to the monument and may not be extended. During each year, work of a type compatible with the purpose of this section and acceptable to the director shall be done. The minimum expenditure for the work shall be established by the commissioner uniformly for all prospecting sites. Where adjacent prospecting sites are held in common, the expenditure may be made on any one or more locations. If a prospecting site expires, neither the locator nor a successor in interest of the locator may again hold the same prospecting site or any portion of it, as a prospecting site, for a period of one year following the date of expiration or abandonment.

###### Sec. 38.05.250.   Prospecting permits and leases on tide and submerged land.

(a) The exclusive right to prospect for deposits of minerals subject to AS 38.05.185§38.05.275 in or on tide and submerged state land may be granted by a permit issued by the director.  A permit shall be granted to the first qualified applicant.  A permit may not include an area larger than 2,560 acres, subject to the rule of approximation.  Land subject to a prospecting permit shall be as compact in form as possible taking into consideration the area involved. The term of the permit shall be 10 years.  Prospecting permits shall be conditioned upon payment of rental against which credit shall be given for useful expenditures on land covered by the permit or group of contiguous permits under common ownership or assignment.  Excess expenditures may be applied against rentals due for the following four years.  The rental shall be $3 per acre for the first two-year period of the permit, payable on the second anniversary of the permit and $3 per acre for each following year, payable annually on the anniversary date of the permit.  Minerals from land under a prospecting permit may not be mined and marketed or used, except for limited amounts necessary for sampling or testing. A person may not take or hold prospecting permits for minerals on state land under this section exceeding in the aggregate 300,000 acres.  A person may not take or hold leases for minerals on state land under this section exceeding in the aggregate 100,000 acres.

(b) A noncompetitive lease shall be granted to a holder of a prospecting permit for so much of the land subject to the permit as is shown to the satisfaction of the director to contain workable mineral deposits. Submerged land containing known deposits of minerals subject to AS 38.05.185§38.05.275 may, in the discretion of the director, be offered by competitive bid. The land shall be leased to the qualified person offering the highest amount of cash bonus.

(c) Each submerged land mining lease shall be for a period of up to 20 years and for so long as there is production in paying quantities from the leased area. A submerged land mining lease may be renewed for a period of up to 20 years at the discretion of the director if the director determines that the renewal is in the best interests of the state.

(d) The commissioner may, on the request of the lessee, assent to the suspension of operation and production under a lease whenever in the judgment of the commissioner the suspension is necessary to promote development of the lease or the lease cannot be successfully operated under its terms.  The payment of acreage rental may be suspended during the period of suspension of operation and production.  The suspension of the lease shall extend the term of the lease by adding the period of suspension to the lease. The commissioner may extend the term of a nonproducing lease on an application by the lessee accompanied by a showing that the lessee is reasonably close to attaining production and that, despite diligent good faith efforts by the lessee, the lessee is not able to produce due to force majeure, depressed market conditions, or other situations beyond the reasonable control of the lessee.  A suspension or extension granted under this subsection may not exceed two years.

###### Sec. 38.05.252.   Extralateral rights under shore, tide, and submerged land.

(a) Extralateral rights under shoreland, tideland, and submerged land are confirmed and granted to an owner of a lode mining claim located before January 3, 1959, under the mining laws of the United States.

(b) In this section, "extralateral rights" means rights given to an owner of a mining claim under 30 U.S.C. 26 to follow, and mine, any vein or lode the apex of which lies within the boundaries of the location of the surface of the mining claim, notwithstanding that the course of the vein or lode on its dip or downward direction may so far depart from the perpendicular as to extend beyond the planes which would be formed by the vertical extension downwards of the sidelines of the location.

###### Sec. 38.05.255.   Surface use of land or water.

(a) Surface uses of land or water included within a mining property by the owners, lessees, or operators shall be limited to those necessary for the prospecting for, extraction of, or basic processing of minerals and shall be subject to reasonable concurrent uses. Leases for millsites, tailings disposal, and other mine related facilities may be issued by the director. The leases shall be conditioned upon payment of a reasonable annual rent for the lease and restricted to uses approved by the director. Timber from land open to mining without lease, except timberland, may be used by a mining claimant or prospecting site locator for the mining or development of the location or adjacent claims under common ownership. On other land, timber may be acquired as provided in this chapter. Use of water shall be made in accordance with AS 46.15.

(b) A lease issued under this section is exempt from the provisions of AS 38.05.075§38.05.080.

###### Sec. 38.05.265.   Abandonment.

(a) Failure to perform the labor or make improvements or make a payment in lieu of labor under AS 38.05.210(a), timely record a certificate of location or statement of annual labor, timely pay any required annual rental, or timely pay any required production royalty under AS 38.05.212 constitutes abandonment of all rights acquired under the mining claim, leasehold location, or prospecting site involved, and the claim, leasehold location, or prospecting site is subject to relocation by others, unless the failure constituting the abandonment is cured under (b) of this section. A locator or claimant of an abandoned location or a successor in interest may not relocate the claim, leasehold location, or prospecting site until one year after abandonment. The locator of an abandoned prospecting site may locate a claim or leasehold location on that site at any time. If an annual rental or a royalty payment is deficient but is otherwise timely paid, abandonment does not result if full payment is made within

(1) the period prescribed by a deficiency notice from the department; or

(2) 30 days after a final judgment establishing the amount due if the deficiency amount due was contested.

(b) Unless another person has located a mining claim or leasehold location that includes all or part of the mining claim or leasehold location abandoned under (a) of this section or the area is closed to mineral location under AS 38.05.185§38.05.275, a person may cure the failure to record or pay rents or royalties that constituted the abandonment and cure the abandonment by

(1) properly recording a certificate of location or a statement of annual labor, paying any required annual rental, and paying any required production royalty; and

(2) paying a penalty equal to the annual rent for the mining claim or leasehold location that was abandoned under (a) of this section.

###### Sec. 38.05.270.   Transfers.

Evidence of a sale, lease, or other transfer of mining property or interest in mining property shall be recorded.

###### Sec. 38.05.275.   Recognition of locations.

(a) Mining locations made on state land, including shoreland, tideland, or submerged land, or state selected land, under AS 38.05.185§38.05.275 or in the manner described in AS 27.10, acquire for the locator mining rights under AS 38.05.185§38.05.275, subject to existing claims and to any denial of or restriction in the tentative approval of state selection or patent of the land to the state. If shoreland, tideland, or submerged land is included in a mining location or within the projected boundaries of a mining location made in accordance with this section, the locator shall record a certificate of location under AS 38.05.195. The certificate of location must identify the position of the mining location in the system of rectangular or protracted surveys. If the mining location is made in the manner described in AS 27.10, the commissioner may require that the locator amend the mining location to conform with AS 38.05.185§38.05.275 and thereafter to comply with the requirements of AS 38.05.185§38.05.275. A mining location on state selected land located within an active unpatented federal mining claim may be located only by or with the written and recorded permission of the holder of the unpatented federal mining claim.

(b) In this section, "state selected land"

(1) means land for which the state has filed a selection application with the United States under Sec. 6 of the Alaska Statehood Act, as amended, regardless of the validity or effect of the application, if the selection described in the application has not been rejected or relinquished;

(2) does not include land described in (1) of this subsection for which a regional corporation organized under 43 U.S.C. 1606(a), as amended, a village corporation organized under 43 U.S.C. 1607(a), as amended, a Native group corporation that qualifies for a land conveyance under 43 U.S.C. 1613(h)(2), as amended, or a Native urban corporation that qualifies for a land conveyance under 43 U.S.C. 1613(h)(3), as amended, has filed a valid selection application with the United States under 43 U.S.C. 1601§1641, as amended, if the selection of the corporation or group has not been rejected or relinquished.

(c) Subsection (b) of this section may not be construed to limit the director in the exercise of authority granted by AS 38.05.035(a)(11).

#### Article 10. Land Selection.

###### Sec. 38.05.290.   Selection practice.

(a) The selection of grant, lieu and indemnity land shall conform to this chapter and the policy, orders and regulations adopted by the commissioner. The commissioner shall give preference of selection to the land which will provide the maximum benefits to the people of the state.

(b) Consistent with the best interests of the state, in the selection of general grant land it is the policy of the state to make available the maximum land area from which municipalities may fulfill land entitlements under AS 29.65 or former AS 29.18.201§29.18.213.

#### Article 11. Parks and Recreation Areas.

###### Sec. 38.05.295.   Parks and recreation areas.

The commissioner shall establish a policy and adopt regulations by which parks and recreation areas, including public scenic overlooks and cultural sites, shall be developed and managed in a manner that will best serve the interests of the people of the state. The commissioner may classify public land as parks, scenic overlooks, cultural sites, and recreation areas as long as the general intent of this chapter is maintained.

#### Article 12. Classification of Land.

###### Sec. 38.05.300.   Classification of land.

(a) The commissioner shall classify for surface use land in areas considered necessary and proper. This section does not prevent reclassification of land where the public interest warrants reclassification, nor does it preclude multiple purpose use of land whenever different uses are compatible. If the area involved contains more than 640 contiguous acres, state land, water, or land and water area may not, except by act of the state legislature, (1) be closed to multiple purpose use, or (2) be otherwise classified by the commissioner so that mining, mineral entry or location, mineral prospecting, or mineral leasing is precluded or is designated an incompatible use, except when the classification is necessary for a land disposal or exchange or is for the development of utility or transportation corridors or projects or similar projects or infrastructure, or except as allowed under (c) of this section.

(b)  [Repealed,§35 ch 126 SLA 1994.]

(c) Notwithstanding (a)(2) of this section, if the commissioner considers it necessary and proper, the commissioner may provide by order for an interim classification that precludes, or designates as an incompatible use, mining, mineral entry or location, mineral prospecting, or mineral leasing. Within 10 days after the convening of each regular legislative session, the commissioner shall transmit to the legislature for consideration all the interim classification orders issued under this subsection during the preceding calendar year. Unless the legislature approves by law an interim classification contained in an order transmitted under this subsection, that order expires on the 90th day of that legislative session or upon adjournment of that session, whichever occurs first. Approval by the legislature of an interim classification satisfies the requirement of (a) of this section for an act of the state legislature.

(B) except as provided by (i) of this section, limit the right of a landowner to construct housing for the landowner and farm laborers, to construct improvements for animals, or to construct improvements that are reasonably required for or related to agricultural use on the original parcel and on additional subdivided parcels, not to exceed the limits and restrictions set by (a)(2) of this section; and

(C) limit the right of the landowner to subdivide and convey the land if the resulting parcels are not in violation of the limits and restrictions set out in (a)(2) of this section.

(e) A landowner may subdivide land classified for agricultural use and for which the landowner obtained a patent under a homestead entry permit issued under AS 38.09 so long as the resulting parcels are not in violation of the minimum parcel size set out in (a) of this section. A landowner may subdivide other land classified for agricultural use as authorized under (d)(3)(C) of this section. If the subdivision involves land classified for agricultural use and for which the landowner obtained a patent under a homestead entry permit issued under AS 38.09, or if the subdivision of land authorized under (d)(3)(C) of this section results only in parcels of 640 acres or more, the landowner may subdivide without payment as required by this subsection. If subdivision of land authorized by (d)(3)(C) of this section would result in one or more parcels of less than 640 acres, the landowner may subdivide only if the landowner first tenders payment to the department for the right to construct housing in each subdivided parcel of less than 640 acres. Payments collected under this subsection shall be separately accounted for and may be appropriated to the agricultural revolving loan fund (AS 03.10.040). For purposes of this subsection, the value of the right to construct housing in a subdivided parcel

(1) is $4,000 for the parcel, subject to adjustment under (h) of this section; or

(2) shall be determined by an appraisal made by an appraiser under contract to the landowner owning the parcel, and the appraisal must include the value, determined as of the date of subdivision, of the right to construct housing by the landowner under (d)(3) of this section.

(f) Notwithstanding (e) of this section, the landowner is not required to pay an amount due under (e) of this section until the subdivided parcel is conveyed by the owner to a person not a member of the person's immediate family. The department has a lien on the parcel as security for payment of the amount due. For purposes of this subsection, "immediate family" means

(1) the spouse of the person; or

(2) a parent, child, including a stepchild and an adopted child, or sibling of the person if the parent, child, or sibling resides with the person, is financially dependent on the person, or shares a substantial financial interest with the person.

(g) A perpetual covenant described in (a) of this section may be enforced only by a civil action brought by the state, a municipality, or a resident. If a municipality or a resident brings an action under this subsection, the municipality or resident shall also serve a copy of the summons and complaint on the state in the manner prescribed by the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure for service on the state. An action may be maintained under this subsection only if

(1) commenced within six years after the cause of action has accrued; and

(2) the plaintiff has first notified in writing the appropriate soil and water conservation district under AS 41.10 of the violation of the covenant at least 90 days before the civil action is filed.

(h) The value of the right to construct housing determined under (e) of this section shall be adjusted to correspond with the change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers for the Anchorage Metropolitan Area compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor. The base year for the computation shall be the calendar year in which the process of conveyance of state land authorized by (a) of this section is initiated under this section.

(i) The authority given in (d)(3)(B) of this section to construct housing and the payment required under (e) of this section for the right to construct housing do not permit the landowner the right to construct condominiums under AS 34.07 or other common interest ownership communities under AS 34.08.

(j) In this section, "agricultural purposes" means

(1) the production, for commercial or personal use, of useful plants and animals;

(2) the construction of

(A) housing for landowners and farm laborers;

(B) improvements for animals; or

(C) improvements that are reasonably required for or related to agricultural use;

(3) the use of gravel reasonably required or related to agricultural production on the parcel conveyed; and

(4) removal and disposition of timber in order to bring agricultural land into use.

#### Article 13. State Control of Certain Land.

###### Sec. 38.05.500.   Electorate determinations.

The people of the State of Alaska determine that:

(1) the intent of the framers of the Constitution of the United States was to guarantee to each of the states sovereignty over all matters within its boundaries except for those powers specifically granted to the United States as agent of the states;

(2) the attempted imposition upon the State of Alaska by the Congress of the United States of a requirement in the Statehood Act that the State of Alaska and its people "disclaim all right and title to any land or other property not granted or confirmed to the state or its political subdivisions by or under the authority of this Act, the right or title to which is held by the United States or is subject to disposition by the United States," as a condition precedent to acceptance of Alaska into the Union, was an act beyond the power of the Congress of the United States and is thus void;

(3) the purported right of ownership and control of the public land in the State of Alaska by the United States is without foundation and violates the clear intent of the Constitution of the United States; and

(4) the exercise of that dominion and control of the public land in the State of Alaska by the United States works a severe, continuous and debilitating hardship upon the people of the State of Alaska.

###### Sec. 38.05.501.   Management.

(a) The Department of Natural Resources shall manage the land which is the subject of AS 38.05.500§38.05.505.  The department will use the provisions of this chapter for the management of the land except to the extent that the provisions of AS 38.05.500§38.05.505 provide to the contrary.

(b) The department shall manage the land in an orderly and beneficial manner.

(c) The department may adopt regulations for the management of the land.  No regulation which imposes a limitation upon the people of the state is effective until approved by the legislature.

(d) The department may sell, lease, exchange, or encumber the land when specifically authorized to do so by law and under the terms and conditions established by the law.

###### Sec. 38.05.502.   Property of the people.

Subject to valid existing rights of applicants for land, upon February 21, 1983, all land in the state and all minerals not previously appropriated are the exclusive property of the people of the state and the state holds title to the land and minerals in trust for the people of the state.

###### Sec. 38.05.503.   Treaties and compacts.

Land in the state which has been administered by the United States under international treaties and interstate compacts will continue to be administered by the state in conformity with those treaties and compacts.

###### Sec. 38.05.504.   Proceeds to the general fund.

The proceeds of sales, fees, rents, royalties or other receipts from the land paid to the state under the provisions of AS 38.05.500§38.05.505 shall be deposited in the general fund, and the legislature may provide for payments in lieu of taxes to local governments.

###### Sec. 38.05.505.   Exclusive enforcement.

(a) The state has exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of AS 38.05.500§38.05.505.

(B) 20 percent of the fair market value determined by an appraisal completed under AS 38.05.550(d)(2), if the applicant provides the appraisal at the applicant's expense and the appraisal is approved by the commissioner.

###### Sec. 38.05.560.   Competitive sales of materials.

(a) The department shall offer materials from a source or site designated under AS 38.05.550(b) for competitive sale if the department determines that

(1) the sale would result in an exclusive use by the purchaser of a designated source or site;

(2) materials available at a designated source or site are insufficient to supply all anticipated buyers;

(3) the size of the designated source or site is too small to accommodate the extraction operations of all anticipated buyers; or

The director may impose conditions, limitations, and terms considered necessary and proper to protect the interests of the state.

###### Sec. 38.05.562.   Violations.

Violation of any provision of AS 38.05.550§38.05.565 or the terms of the contract of sale subjects the purchaser to appropriate legal action.

The commissioner shall ensure, by regulation, deed restriction, covenant, or otherwise, that disposals of land under this subsection serve a public purpose and are in the public interest.

(b) Notwithstanding AS 38.05.070§38.05.080 and 38.05.095, the director, upon application filed by an applicant eligible under (b)§(d) of this section, may, by negotiation and without competitive bid in the manner prescribed in (b)§(d) of this section, lease state land for a term of not more than 55 years. Before leasing, the director shall prepare a land use plan and a land classification to ensure that the proposed use is compatible with area utilization. Before the land may be leased under (b)§(d) of this section, it must be shown to the satisfaction of the director that the land is to be used for an established or definitely proposed project, and that the eligible applicant has the financial ability to carry out the project. The commissioner may establish limitations on the acreage that may be leased under (b)§(d) of this section to an applicant.

(c) Eligible applicants under (b)§(d) of this section are limited to nonprofit corporations, associations, clubs, or societies organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious, scientific, or educational purposes, or for the promotion of social welfare, if the project for which the land is desired conforms to those objectives and not commercial development.  No lease of land may be granted under this section for a project closed to the use and enjoyment of the general public.  In every case the applicant shall submit evidence that it is exempt from payment of federal income tax.  As a condition of and in consideration of the rights acquired under a lease granted under (b)§(d) of this section, each eligible organization and its parent or subsidiary organizations shall (1) maintain and preserve books, accounts, and records that the director prescribes by regulation as necessary and appropriate; and (2) accord at all reasonable times to the state and its authorized agents and auditors the right of access to those books, accounts and records for the purpose of inspecting, examining and copying them.  Any information provided the state in the course of an audit becomes a matter of public record.

(d) The director may lease the land to an eligible applicant at a reasonable annual rental, taking into consideration the purposes for which the land is to be used and the financial resources of the applicant.  The rental may not be less than one percent of the fair market value on land acquired primarily for development, or less than five percent of the fair market value on acquired land.  Rent may not be charged for state land leased for a youth encampment.  For the purposes of this subsection, "youth encampment" shall be defined by the commissioner by regulation.  Renewal leases may be issued at the discretion of the director upon the expiration of a primary or renewal term.  Each lease shall contain a provision for its termination as to all or part of the land upon a finding by the director that the land or a part of it has not been used by the lessee for the purpose specified in the lease for a period of two years.  No lease may be assigned or subleased except with the consent of the director, and in any case may only be transferred to an applicant eligible under (b)§(d) of this section.  A lessee may not change the use specified in the lease to another or additional use except with the consent of the director.  If, at any time after the land is leased, the lessee attempts to assign the lease or transfer control over the land to another, or if the land is devoted to a use other than that for which the land was leased without the consent of the director, the lease automatically terminates.

(e) The lease, sale, or other disposal of state land at appraised fair market value may be negotiated with a licensed public utility or a licensed common carrier by the director with the approval of the commissioner if the utility or carrier reasonably requires the land for the conduct of its business under its license. Notwithstanding AS 38.05.550§38.05.565, the sale of materials necessary for construction, use, or maintenance of property leased, sold, or disposed of under this section may be negotiated by the director. A lease with a licensed public utility that is an electric utility entered into under this subsection may not include, as part of the rent or other fee that is negotiated or charged, an amount that is based on or determined by a percentage of gross revenue for renewable energy produced by the electric utility.

(f) The commissioner shall lease state land for telephone or electric transmission and distribution lines for less than the appraised value of the land if the lessee is a nonprofit cooperative association organized under AS 10.25.  The commissioner may lease state land that is not located within the boundary of a municipality for the disposal of garbage, refuse, trash, or other waste material for less than the appraised value of the land if the lessee is a licensed public utility authorized to collect and dispose of garbage, refuse, trash, or other waste material outside the boundaries of a municipality. Before determining the annual rental, the commissioner shall consider the nature of the public service rendered by the nonprofit cooperative association or licensed public utility and the terms of the grant under which the land was acquired by the state.  A nonprofit cooperative association may not construct improvements other than transmission or distribution lines and substations on land leased under this subsection.  A licensed public utility may not construct permanent improvements on land leased under this subsection that are not related to the purpose of the lease.

(g) The commissioner shall retain a reversionary interest on each sale or other disposal granted under (a) or (e) of this section. The commissioner may waive the reversionary interest on a written determination that the waiver is in the public interest.

(h) The commissioner may issue permits to the Alaska Aerospace Corporation for purposes of down range space vehicle or payload overflight, booster retrieval, and recovery. The commissioner may, if it is in the best interests of the state, lease land to the Alaska Aerospace Corporation for other space-related purposes for, or at less than the appraised market value.

(i) Subject to AS 38.05.820, the commissioner may lease undeveloped state land, including tideland, to a port authority established under AS 29.35.600§29.35.730, if the state land is within the physical boundaries of the authority and is needed by the authority for purposes provided in AS 29.35.600§29.35.730. The commissioner may lease developed state land, including tideland, to a port authority established under AS 29.35.600§29.35.730 only if, (1) the developed state land is within the physical boundaries of the authority; (2) the developed state land is needed by the authority for purposes provided in AS 29.35.600§29.35.730; and (3) the legislature approves the lease. A lease of state land under this subsection may be for less than the appraised market value.

###### Sec. 38.05.820.   Occupied tide and submerged land.

(a) It is the policy of the state to allow preference rights for the acquisition of tide and submerged land occupied or developed for municipal business, residential or other beneficial purposes on or before the date of admission of Alaska into the Union. Nothing in this section vests the right in a person to acquire the land until a conveyance from the state is delivered to the grantee.

(b) Home rule cities and cities of the first class incorporated on or before April 1, 1964, may apply, in the manner prescribed by the director, and in accordance with such regulations as the director may adopt, for a conveyance to them of all land seaward of the home rule cities and cities of the first class which is between the mean high tide line in, or forming the boundary of, the home rule cities and cities of the first class, and a line to be shown on a plat made a part of the application which shall be the pierhead line established under the Act of September 7, 1957, or the harbor line established under the Act of March 3, 1899, or if no pierhead line or harbor line is established then a line subject to approval by the director, with the concurrence of the commissioner, which shall be seaward of all tide and submerged land occupied or suitable for occupation and development without unreasonable interference with navigation.  The director shall convey that tide and submerged land to home rule cities and cities of the first class. Applications by preference right claimants filed with the director before June 30, 1964, shall continue to be processed to a final determination and conveyance, if any, by the director, if such preference right claimants are entitled to a conveyance from the director under the laws existing previous to July 22, 1964.

(1) Each home rule city and city of the first class granted a conveyance shall prepare an official subdivision plat of the area conveyed showing all structures and improvements and the boundaries of each tract occupied or developed, together with the name of the owner or claimant.  The subdivisional plat shall include within the boundaries of each tract occupied or developed such surrounding tide and submerged land as is reasonably necessary in the opinion of the governing body of the home rule cities and cities of the first class for the use and enjoyment of the structures and improvements by the owner or claimant, but shall not include tide or submerged land which if granted to the occupant would unjustly deprive an occupant of adjoining land from reasonable use and enjoyment of it.

(2) An occupant of land included in the conveyance to home rule cities and cities of the first class, who occupied or developed the land on and before September 7, 1957, has a class I preference right to the land from the home rule cities and cities of the first class upon the execution of a waiver to the state and the home rule cities and cities of the first class of all rights the occupant may have acquired under Public Law 85-303 (71 Stat. 623).

(3) An occupant of land included in the conveyance to home rule cities and cities of the first class, who has a class II preference right by reason of the conveyance to home rule cities and cities of the first class, and is unwilling to waive the right has a preference right to the land which it is mandatory for the home rule cities and cities of the first class to expeditiously honor upon application from the occupant after the Secretary of the Army has submitted to the Secretary of the Interior and the governor of the state maps showing the pierhead line established by the Corps of Engineers with respect to the tract so granted.

(4) An occupant of land included in the conveyance to home rule cities and cities of the first class, who occupied or developed the land after September 7, 1957, and before January 3, 1959, and who continued to occupy it on January 3, 1959, has a class III preference right to the land from the home rule cities and cities of the first class.

(5) In making a conveyance to an occupant, the home rule cities and cities of the first class shall include as a part of the tract conveyed and in addition to the occupied or developed land, such additional tide and submerged land as is reasonably necessary in the opinion of the governing body of the home rule cities and cities of the first class for the occupant's use and enjoyment of the occupied or developed land, but the conveyance shall not include any area which would unjustly deprive an occupant of adjoining land from reasonable use and enjoyment of it or which, if developed, will interfere with navigation.

(6) Each home rule city and city of the first class receiving conveyances shall by ordinance provide for reasonable regulations governing the filing and processing of applications, publication of notices, and the adjudication of disputes between claimants by the governing body of the home rule cities and cities of the first class.  A party aggrieved by its determination may appeal to the superior court.

(7) When no preference right has been granted to purchase or lease tideland, the home rule cities and cities of the first class may sell or lease the tideland conveyed to them, and may impose terms or conditions for the sale or lease.  Such terms and conditions shall include such reservation of rights-of-way as are necessary to provide reasonable access to public waters.

(c) An occupant of tide or submerged land which is not seaward of a municipal corporation, who occupied or developed it on and prior to September 7, 1957, has a class I preference right to the land from the state. However, if the land is seaward of a surveyed townsite, the occupant shall execute a waiver to the state of all rights which the occupant may have acquired under Public Law 85-303 (71 Stat. 623), before the preference right may be exercised.

(1) A person who has a class II preference right in the disposition of land by the state not provided for under (b)(3) of this section, and who is unwilling to waive that right, has a preference right to the land which it is mandatory for the director to expeditiously honor upon application from the occupant after the Secretary of the Army has submitted to the Secretary of the Interior and the governor of the state maps showing the pierhead line established by the Corps of Engineers with respect to the tract so granted.

(2) An occupant of tide or submerged land which is not seaward of a municipal corporation, who occupied or developed it after September 7, 1957, and before January 3, 1959, and who continued to occupy it on January 3, 1959, has a class III preference right to the land from the state.

(3) The preference right granted an occupant in (c) of this section is lost unless the occupant of tide or submerged land not seaward of a home rule or first class city makes application to the director to exercise the preference right by July 1, 1967.

(4) Each occupant shall furnish at the cost of the occupant a plat showing the exterior boundaries of the tide and submerged land covered by the application, in form and with proof of accuracy as set out in regulations of the director, and shall show the location and nature of all fill material, buildings, structures and improvements, which form the basis of the application and which are situated upon the tract applied for. The applicant may include within the boundaries of the tract applied for such surrounding tide and submerged land as is reasonably necessary in the opinion of the applicant for the use and enjoyment of the structures and improvements by the occupant, but may not include any tide or submerged land which if granted to the occupant would unjustly deprive an occupant of adjoining land from reasonable use and enjoyment of it.

(5) In making a conveyance to an occupant, the director shall include as a part of the tract conveyed, and in addition to the occupied or developed land, such additional tide and submerged land as is reasonably necessary in the opinion of the director for the occupant's use and enjoyment of the occupied or developed land, but the conveyance shall not include any area which would unjustly deprive an occupant of adjoining land from reasonable use and enjoyment of it or which, if developed, will interfere with navigation.

(6) The director shall by regulation provide for reasonable procedures governing the filing and processing of applications, the publication of notices and the adjudication of disputes between claimants.  A party aggrieved by an adjudication may appeal to the superior court.

(7) The holder of a valid Corps of Engineers permit issued before November 15, 1959, may be given a preference to a lease or permit by the state if justified in accordance with the policy of this chapter and if in the best interests of the state. This preference is subordinate to all other preferences recognized under this chapter.

###### Sec. 38.05.821.   Tideland seaward of public recreational sites.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a home rule or general law municipality that accepts by conveyance or other disposition from the state a public recreation area facility developed under the terms of P.L. 84-507, 70 Stat. 130, upon application, shall receive by conveyance from the director all land owned by the state seaward of the public recreation area facility that is between the mean high tide line and the mean low tide line. The director may adopt necessary regulations providing for the conveyance of land under this section.

(b) Interests obtained by lease for shore fisheries development, sale, permit, or lease for mineral exploration, development, or extraction, or for any other purpose, before August 13, 1974, are affected by this section only on the date of their expiration or termination.

###### Sec. 38.05.825.   Conveyance of tide and submerged land to municipalities.

(a) Unless the commissioner finds that the public interest in retaining state ownership of the land clearly outweighs the municipality's interest in obtaining the land, the commissioner shall convey to a municipality tide or submerged land requested by the municipality that is occupied or suitable for occupation and development if the

(1) land is within or contiguous to the boundaries of the municipality;

(2) use of the land would not unreasonably interfere with navigation or public access;

(3) municipality has applied to the commissioner for conveyance of the land under this section;

(4) land is not subject to a shore fisheries lease under AS 38.05.082, or, if the land is subject to a shore fisheries lease, the commissioner determines it is in the best interests of the state to convey the land;

(5) land is classified for waterfront development or for another use that is consistent or compatible with the use proposed by the municipality, or the proposed use of the land is consistent or compatible with a land use plan adopted by the municipality or the department; and

(6) land

(A) is required for the accomplishment of a public or private development approved by the municipality;

(B) is the subject of a lease from the state to the municipality; or

(C) has been approved for lease to the municipality.

(b) The commissioner may not convey land under this section that has been designated by statute unless the commissioner determines that the proposed use is consistent or compatible with the purpose of the statutory designation. Land designated as a state game refuge, game sanctuary, or critical habitat area may not be conveyed unless the commissioner of fish and game also determines that the proposed use is consistent or compatible with the purpose of the designation. If land designated by statute is conveyed, uses of the land after conveyance are restricted to those uses determined by the commissioner of natural resources to be consistent or compatible with the purpose of the designation.

(c) Upon receipt of an application, the commissioner shall determine whether the requested conveyance meets the requirements of this section and issue a written decision regarding that determination. Upon a determination that the requirements have been met, the commissioner shall approve the conveyance of the land to the municipality. After conveyance to the municipality is approved, the municipality has management authority of the land and may lease the land, but may not sell it. The cost of the survey and all subdivision or other platting required for conveyance shall be borne by the municipality.

(d) A conveyance under this section may contain only those restrictions required by law, including AS 38.05.127 and (b) of this section, or required to support a finding that the conveyance is in the best interest of the state. Land conveyed is subject to the public trust doctrine that may be enforced by the state in a court of competent jurisdiction. The municipality shall be required to ensure that reasonable access to public waters and tidelands is provided. The municipality may not lease land conveyed under this section for shore fisheries, but after conveyance, the land may be leased by the state for shore fisheries under AS 38.05.082 if the commissioner determines that the lease is compatible with the municipality's use of the land. Title to land conveyed under this section that is retained by the municipality reverts to the state upon the dissolution of the municipality.

(e) This section does not enlarge or diminish the general grant land entitlement of a municipality under AS 29.65, nor is a conveyance under this section counted against the municipality's general grant land entitlement.

###### Sec. 38.05.830.   Land disposal in the unorganized borough.

Before a sale, lease under AS 38.05.070§38.05.105, or other disposal of state land in the unorganized borough, the commissioner shall consider the effect that the sale, lease, or other disposal may be expected to have on the density of the population in the vicinity of the land, and potential for conflicts with the traditional uses of the land that could result from the sale, lease, or disposal.  If necessary, the commissioner shall develop a plan to resolve or mitigate the conflicts in a manner consistent with the public interest and the provisions of this chapter.

###### Sec. 38.05.840.   Appraisal.

(a) Land may not be sold or leased, or a renewal lease issued, except in the case of an oil or gas or mineral lease, unless it has been appraised within two years before the date fixed for the sale or lease. When land is offered at public sale but is not sold and is available at private sale, a reappraisal is not required unless the director considers that a change in value of the land may have occurred. A grazing lease may be granted to a lessee of federal grazing land without prior appraisal if the federal lease was cancelled to allow the state to select the land under lease. Land may not be sold or leased for less than the approved, appraised market value, except as provided in AS 38.05.055, 38.05.057, 38.05.075§38.05.085, 38.05.097, 38.05.810, and 38.05.820.

(b) Appraisals required by this section may be made by employees of the department who are qualified to determine the value of land under standards set by the commissioner.

###### Sec. 38.05.850.   Permits.

(a) The director, without the prior approval of the commissioner, may issue permits, rights-of-way, or easements on state land for roads, trails, ditches, field gathering lines or transmission and distribution pipelines not subject to AS 38.35, telephone or electric transmission and distribution lines, log storage, oil well drilling sites and production facilities for the purposes of recovering minerals from adjacent land under valid lease, and other similar uses or improvements, or revocable, nonexclusive permits for the personal or commercial use or removal of resources that the director has determined to be of limited value. The commissioner, upon recommendation of the director, shall establish a reasonable rate or fee schedule to be charged for these uses, subject to the exception for nonprofit cooperative associations specified in (b) of this section. In the granting, suspension, or revocation of a permit or easement of land, the director shall give preference to that use of the land that will be of greatest economic benefit to the state and the development of its resources. However, first preference shall be granted to the upland owner for the use of a tract of tideland, or tideland and contiguous submerged land, that is seaward of the upland property of the upland owner and that is needed by the upland owner for any of the purposes for which the use may be granted.

(b) The fee charged for a right-of-way approved under (a) of this section shall be waived by the commissioner if the right-of-way is for a transmission or distribution line established by a nonprofit cooperative association organized under AS 10.25 for the purpose of supplying electric energy and power, or telephone service, to its members, and the waiver is considered by the commissioner to be in the best interests of the state.

(c) If the director determines, by evaluation of the nature and duration of the intended use, that an easement or right-of-way issued under this section will not be functionally revocable, the director shall provide public notice before issuing the easement or right-of-way.

###### Secs. 38.05.855 ,  38.05.856.   Identification of sites for aquatic farms and hatcheries; tideland and land use permits for aquatic farming. [Repealed,§38 ch 91 SLA 1997.]

###### Sec. 38.05.860.   Deposits.

(a) The commissioner may require an applicant seeking the sale, lease, or other disposal of land or an interest in land, other than under an oil and gas lease, gas only lease, or mineral lease, to deposit an amount covering the estimated cost of an appraisal, survey, and other costs necessary to offer the land or interest in land, including advertising. All deposited funds not expended shall be refunded to the applicant. If the land or interest in land is awarded to a person other than the applicant making the deposit, the person awarded the land shall pay the total actual cost incurred by the department in making the disposal, and the deposit shall be returned to the original applicant. In lieu of requiring the deposit under this subsection, the commissioner may enter into an agreement with an applicant seeking land or an interest in land requiring the applicant to reimburse the department for costs incurred in the disposal if the applicant is awarded the land or interest in land.

(b) Except as provided in (c) of this section, if a competitive sale or lease of state land, minerals, timber, or materials is to be made by sealed bid, the director may require each bidder to submit an earnest money deposit with each bid.  If the sale or lease is by public auction, the director may require each person desiring to bid to make an earnest money deposit before bidding.  The earnest money deposit of the highest qualified bidder shall be applied toward the sale or lease price. If the successful bidder defaults in the payment of the amount bid, the deposit shall be forfeited to the state.  All other earnest money deposits shall be returned unless the commissioner decides to award the contract to the second highest qualified bidder upon default by the highest bidder rather than call for new bids, in which case the commissioner may retain the deposit of the second highest qualified bidder until final disposition of the land is made.  A successful bidder for a mineral lease who can prove to the satisfaction of the commissioner within 45 days after notification of the lease award that there is a reasonable doubt as to the ability of the state to grant a valid lease to the land may withdraw the amount bid and have the earnest money deposit returned.

(c) The commissioner shall require each bidder for the competitive leasing of land for oil and gas, or for gas only, to submit with each bid a deposit of money equal to 20 percent of the bonus.

###### Sec. 38.05.870.   Grants of land after natural disaster.

(a) The director may make grants of state land to persons and municipal corporations to replace land which is rendered unusable by a natural disaster for the purposes for which it was used before the natural disaster.  The director shall designate state land which is available to replace land rendered unusable.

(b) Only a person who is the owner of land rendered unusable that was used or leased before the natural disaster for private residential, business, or commercial purposes is eligible for a grant of state land.  A person who incurred a binding obligation to purchase land before the natural disaster shall be considered the owner of the land for the purposes of this section.

(c) An application for a grant of state land shall be filed with the director, and shall contain

(1) the name and address of the applicant;

(2) a legal description of the land rendered unusable;

(3) proof of ownership of the land; and

(4) a statement of the purpose for which the land was used before the natural disaster rendered it unusable.

(d) The director shall, within 30 days of receipt of the application, approve or disapprove the application.  The director's determination of eligibility for a grant of state land is final.  Upon approval of the application or as soon thereafter as possible, the director shall specify the land which shall be granted to an eligible applicant.  In making the designation the director shall consider the value, size and use of the land rendered unusable as a result of the natural disaster, and shall as nearly as possible grant land of equal size, or value or of equal utility.

(e) The applicant shall pay costs, not to exceed the administrative cost of transferring the property and the cost of surveying the land.  In addition, the state may require a quitclaim deed to the unusable land in exchange for the grant of state land.

(f) In this section "natural disaster" means a flood, drought, fire, storm, earthquake, or other catastrophe which, in the determination of the governor, is or threatens to be of sufficient severity to warrant state assistance to persons and municipal corporations to alleviate damage, suffering, and hardship caused by the catastrophe.

###### Sec. 38.05.872.   Disposition of state land and resources for flood control projects.

(a) The department may make conveyances of title or other interests in state land, provide for exchange of land, or make other arrangements with respect to state land, as necessary to meet federally established requirements of flood control projects authorized inside the state by the United States.

(b) The commissioner may convey materials at less than fair market value to municipalities, other state and federal agencies, or other entities, and make other arrangements for land and materials as mitigation of a flooding area where excess material deposition significantly contributes to the flooding, consistent with a site-specific flood mitigation plan approved by the commissioner and determined to be in the best interests of the public.

###### Sec. 38.05.874.   Public access fund created.

(a) The public access fund is established as a special account in the general fund and funds may be deposited into the special account and withdrawn from it as provided in this section. The fund consists of money contributed to it by individuals and corporations and interest derived from those contributions. The fund shall be invested by the commissioner of revenue. The Department of Revenue may be reimbursed for actual administrative costs incurred under this subsection by appropriation from the public access fund.

(b) Except as provided in (a) of this section, the commissioner shall administer the fund. The commissioner, after public hearings and in concurrence with the commissioner of fish and game, may use money in the fund to develop recreational access, including the purchase and lease of land, easements, and rights-of-way to enhance public access to recreational areas.

(c) The title to rights of public access to recreational areas obtained by the commissioner vests in the state. The commissioner shall include in the instrument transferring title to the state a clause requiring that the land be used for public access. If the land ceases to be available for public access, the state shall either

(1) pay to the fund the assessed value of the land at that time; or

(2) if the land was purchased with funds derived under 16 U.S.C. 777§777k (Sport Fish Restoration Act), as amended, reimburse the sport fish restoration program.

(d) The legislature may appropriate to the fund. The interest earned on funds appropriated to the public access fund by the legislature shall be deposited in the general fund. The commissioner of administration shall separately account for the interest deposited in the general fund under this subsection. The annual estimated balance in the account may be appropriated by the legislature to the public access fund.

###### Sec. 38.05.875.   Administration of land acquired under former AS 34.10.

The department may sell, lease, or administer all real property to which the state obtained title under former AS 34.10 in the same manner as it is authorized to sell, lease, or administer other state land. Proceeds derived from the sales, leases, or administration shall be remitted to the Department of Revenue and deposited into the general fund of the state.

###### Sec. 38.05.880.   Departmental review.

#### Article 17. General Provisions.

###### Sec. 38.05.910.   Policy.

It is the policy of the state to encourage the settlement of its land and the development of its resources by making them available for maximum use consistent with the public interest.

###### Sec. 38.05.920.   Assignment.

(a) Except as provided in (b) of this section, all contracts of purchase or lease of land or interest in land may be, on the affirmative approval of the director, assigned or subleased in whole or in part in writing by the contract holder or lessee, and the assignee or sublessee is subject to the provisions of laws and regulations applicable to the contract or lease.

(b) A nonprofit organization that is exempted from paying rent on state land under AS 38.05.097 may not assign or sublease the land or a portion of it on which it has a lease.

###### Sec. 38.05.930.   Bona fide purchasers.

The right, title, or interest of a bona fide purchaser of any lease, interest in a lease, or option to acquire a lease or an interest in it, acquired after the effective date of issuance of the lease and held by a qualified person, association, or corporation in conformity with this chapter may not be canceled or forfeited or otherwise adversely affected by reason of the fact that the holding of the person, association, or corporation from which the lease, interest, or option was acquired, or of a predecessor in title, including the original lessee of the state, may have been canceled or forfeited, or may be or have been subject to cancellation or forfeiture.  If, in any proceeding for cancellation or forfeiture, an underlying lease, interest, or option is canceled or forfeited to the state and there are valid interests therein or valid options to acquire the lease or an interest therein which are not subject to cancellation or forfeiture, the underlying lease, interest, or option shall be sold by the director to the highest responsible qualified bidder by competitive bidding under general competitive leasing regulations subject to all outstanding valid interests therein and valid options pertaining thereto.  Likewise if, in any such proceeding, less than the whole interest in a lease, interest, or option is canceled or forfeited to the state, the partial interests so canceled or forfeited shall be sold by the director to the highest responsible qualified bidder under general competitive leasing regulations.

###### Sec. 38.05.940.   Land purchase price discount for veterans.

(a) An eligible veteran is entitled to a discount of 25 percent on the purchase price of state land sold under this title and classified under AS 38.05.005§38.05.270 for a use other than commercial or industrial use.

###### Sec. 38.20.030.   Designation of zones.

In any land description in which a coordinate system is used a zone of the coordinate system is designated the "Alaska Coordinate System of 1927, Zone ....................," the "Alaska Coordinate System of 1983, Zone ....................,"  or the "Alaska Coordinate System of 2022, Zone ...................."

###### Sec. 38.20.040.   Use of coordinate system.

The plane coordinates of a point on the earth's surface, to be used in expressing the position or location of the point in the appropriate zone of this system, consist of two distances, expressed in U.S. survey feet and decimals of a U.S. survey foot when using the Alaska Coordinate System of 1927, expressed in meters and decimals of a meter when using the Alaska Coordinate System of 1983, and expressed in meters and decimals of a meter or international feet and decimals of an international foot when using the Alaska Coordinate System of 2022. One of these distances, known as the "x-coordinate," gives the position in an east-and-west direction; the other, known as the "y-coordinate," gives the position in a north-and-south direction. These coordinates shall be made to depend on and conform to the coordinates of the National Spatial Reference System as determined by the National Geodetic Survey, National Ocean Service.

###### Sec. 38.20.050.   Land lying in two zones.

When a tract of land to be defined by a single description extends from one coordinate zone into another, the positions of all points on its boundaries may be referred to either of the two zones, the zone which is used being specifically named in the description.

(b) The position of the Alaska Coordinate System of 1983 shall be as marked on the ground by triangulation or traverse stations established in conformity with the standards adopted by the National Geodetic Survey, National Ocean Service whose geodetic positions have been rigidly adjusted on the North American datum of 1983 and whose plane coordinates have been computed on the system defined in this chapter.

###### Sec. 38.20.080.   Limitation.

Coordinates based on the Alaska Coordinate System, purporting to define the position of a point on a land boundary, may not be presented to be recorded in any public land records or deed records unless the point is within two miles of a horizontal control station established in conformity with National Geodetic Survey, National Ocean Service standards and specifications for first-order, second-order, or third-order work.  The two-mile limitation may be modified by a state agency to meet local conditions.

###### Sec. 38.20.090.   Use of system name.

(a) The use of the term "Alaska Coordinate System of 1927" on a map, report of survey, or other document is limited to coordinates based on the Alaska Coordinate System of 1927 as defined in this chapter.

(a) A person or persons desiring to own a pipeline which is proposed to be located in whole or in part on state land, shall apply for a noncompetitive right-of-way lease of the state land.

(b) Applications under (a) of this section shall be made in a form and manner prescribed by regulation, and shall include any and all data, information, plans, and exhibits which the commissioner determines are necessary to prepare the analysis required by AS 38.35.080 and to make a decision under AS 38.35.100.

(c) Any amendment to an application filed under this section that constitutes a substantial change in the application is subject to all provisions of this chapter applying to an original application. For purposes of this subsection,

(1) an amendment constitutes a substantial change in the application only if the amendment proposes

(A) a net increase in the amount of state acreage to be leased for the right-of-way that exceeds by at least 10 percent the amount of the acreage in the applicant's original application;

(B) a change in the design of the pipeline that would use less effective environmental or safety mitigation measures or less advanced technology than proposed in the original application; or

(C) a fundamental change in the general route, which would include the origin or terminus, as set out in the original application;

(2) in calculating the percentage increase in acreage under (1)(A) of this subsection, each of the following must be excluded:

(A) the acreage attributable to an amendment of a right-of-way originally issued by the federal government, whether administered by the state or the federal government; and

(B) land subject to an existing federal right-of-way grant held by the applicant that is transferred to the state for its administration.

(d) All persons owning or planning to own an interest in a pipeline or proposed pipeline subject to a lease must join in the application under (a) of this section.  Any person employed by the lessee in operating the pipeline is bound by the covenants of the lease applicable to functions within the scope of employment as if the person were an applicant under the lease and the state may enforce any breach of a covenant directly against an operator who is not in compliance with the covenant.

###### Sec. 38.35.070.   Notice of application.

Upon receiving an application under AS 38.35.050, the commissioner shall

(1) cause notice of it to appear in a daily newspaper of general circulation published in the vicinity of the location of the proposed pipeline, the notice to include:

(A) a general description of the land involved;

(B) a summary of the substance of the application;

(2) file copies of the application with each coordinate agency;

(3) furnish at cost copies of a notice or application to persons requesting them; and

(4) provide other publication and notice the commissioner considers reasonable and appropriate to inform the public of the application.

###### Sec. 38.35.080.   Analysis and public hearing.

(a) The commissioner shall, within a reasonable time after receiving the application, prepare an analysis of the application or of the matter of which the commissioner was notified, including a proposal for action if feasible; a proposed lease and a general statement of the basis and purpose of the commissioner, if favorable action is proposed; or, when a proposal for action is not feasible before a hearing, a description of the subjects and issues involved.

(b) Upon completion of the analysis but not less than 30 days before the date set for hearing an application or an amendment to an application that, under AS 38.35.050(c), constitutes a substantial change in the application, the commissioner shall publish notice, and make copies available as provided in AS 38.35.070.

(c) The commissioner shall set all applications for public hearing as soon as practicable, if a public hearing on an application is requested by any person within 30 days of publication of notice under AS 38.35.070(1) or if the proposed action being considered involves a substantial public interest. The commissioner shall set the application for public hearing and publish notice of the time and place of the public hearing at least 30 days before the hearing.

(d) The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (AS 44.62) do not apply to hearings held under this section.

###### Sec. 38.35.090.   Multiple applications for same lease.

When the commissioner receives within a 30-day period two or more applications relating to the same or substantially the same subject matter, the commissioner shall consider the applications upon a comparative basis.  The commissioner may extend the time within which a carrier may submit an application for consideration upon a comparative basis with a previously filed application.

###### Sec. 38.35.100.   Decision on application.

(a) The commissioner shall promptly determine, in a written finding, on an application filed under AS 38.35.050, whether the applicant is fit, willing, and able to perform the transportation or other acts proposed in a manner that will be required by the present or future public interest.  In making a determination the commissioner shall consider whether or not

(1) the proposed use of the right-of-way will unreasonably conflict with existing uses of the land involving a superior public interest;

(2) the applicant has the technical and financial capability to protect state and private property interests;

(3) the applicant has the technical and financial capability to take action to the extent reasonably practical to

(A) prevent any significant adverse environmental impact, including but not limited to erosion of the surface of the land and damage to fish and wildlife and their habitat;

(B) undertake any necessary restoration or revegetation; and

(C) protect the interests of individuals living in the general area of the right-of-way who rely on fish, wildlife, and biotic resources of the area for subsistence purposes;

(4) the applicant has the financial capability to pay reasonably foreseeable damages for which the applicant may become liable on claims arising from the construction, operation, maintenance, or termination of the pipeline;

(5) the applicant has agreed that in the construction and operation of a pipeline within the right-of-way the applicant will comply with, and require contractors and their subcontractors to comply with, applicable and valid laws and regulations regarding the hiring of residents of the state then in effect or that take effect subsequently.

(b) If the commissioner makes the determinations under (a) of this section favorably to the applicant, then the commissioner may grant the whole or part of the application.  If the commissioner makes the determinations under (a)(1)§(5) of this section favorably to the applicant but determines that the applicant is not then fit, willing, and able to perform under the application, the commissioner may grant the application under a conditional lease subject to conditions established by the commissioner that will ensure that the applicant will, within a prescribed period of time not exceeding 10 years, establish that the applicant is fit, willing, and able, under (a) of this section, to perform the transportation or other acts that will be required by the present or future public interest. An applicant is not entitled to a notice or authorization to proceed to construction, or its equivalent, under a conditional lease until the commissioner determines in writing that the applicant has satisfactorily established that the applicant is then fit, willing, and able to perform under (a) of this section. Otherwise, the commissioner shall deny the application.

(c) The commissioner may offer the applicant a lease or a conditional lease under this section. If the applicant does not accept a lease offered under this section within 30 days, the lease offered is withdrawn.

(d) The commissioner shall include in a conditional lease each requirement and condition of the covenants established under AS 38.35.120 or 38.35.121, as applicable. The commissioner may also require that the lessee agree to additional conditions that the commissioner finds to be in the public interest. In place of the covenant established under AS 38.35.120(a)(9), the commissioner shall require the lessee to agree that it will not transfer, assign, pledge, or dispose of in any manner, directly or indirectly, its interest in a conditional right-of-way lease or a pipeline subject to the conditional lease, unless the commissioner, after considering the public interest and issuing written findings to substantiate a decision to allow the transfer, authorizes the transfer. The commissioner shall also require the lessee to agree not to allow the transfer of control of the lessee without the approval of the commissioner; as used in this subsection, "transfer of control of the lessee" means the transfer of 30 percent or more, in the aggregate, of ownership interest in the lessee in one or more transactions to one or more persons by one or more persons.

(e) The commissioner shall require a conditional lessee to agree that

(1) in the absence of the approval of the commissioner, a transfer may not relieve the lessee of an obligation assumed under the lease;

(2) a transfer, including the transfer of lessee, that occurs without the approval of the commissioner is ineffective to transfer interests in and obligations under the lease; and

(3) a transfer constitutes a default under the lease.

(f) In an application for the approval under (d) of this section of a transfer of an interest, the commissioner shall consider whether the proposed transferee will be fit, willing, and able to perform the transportation or other acts proposed under the conditions established in the conditional lease and whether the transfer is in the public interest. In approving the transfer of an interest under (d) of this section and this subsection, the commissioner may impose any condition on the transfer that the commissioner considers in the public interest.

(g) If, during the term of a conditional lease, the commissioner determines under (a) of this section that the applicant is fit, willing, and able to perform the transportation or other acts proposed in a manner that will be required by the present or future public interest, the commissioner may amend the conditional right-of-way lease to insert the covenant established in AS 38.35.120(a)(9) in place of the covenant against a transfer established under (d) and (e) of this section.

(h) The issuance of a conditional lease does not prevent the commissioner from issuing other conditional or unconditional leases for the same right-of-way. A conditional lease may be revoked at any time that the commissioner determines that the applicant or conditional lessee will not be fit, willing, and able to perform during the term of the lease or when another applicant or conditional lessee is determined to be fit, willing, and able to perform under an application or lease for all or part of the right-of-way. An applicant or conditional lessee accrues no rights, including preference or priority rights, to a particular right-of-way until the commissioner makes a determination that the applicant or conditional lessee is then fit, willing, and able to perform the transportation or other acts proposed under (a) of this section.

(i) The commissioner shall insert a provision implementing the requirements of (a)(5) of this section into each agreement entered into by the commissioner for the construction and operation of a pipeline within the state.

###### Sec. 38.35.110.   Term of lease; continuation.

(a) Each lease of state land for pipeline right-of-way purposes must contain a provision that the lease shall run for a specified term of not greater than 30 years, and shall be renewable for additional periods of up to 30 years each, so long as the lessee is in commercial operation and is in full compliance with all state law, including but not limited to state law pertaining to regulation and taxation of the pipeline facility, and is in compliance with all terms of the lease. In making this determination, the commissioner shall take into consideration the cost of the proposed pipeline, its useful life, and the probable financing requirement for the proposed pipeline.

(b) If the lessee has timely requested and is pursuing renewal and the determination on the renewal has not been issued before expiration of the existing lease term, the commissioner shall continue the lease subject to the terms and conditions that were applicable to the lease in effect at the time of expiration of the lease's term until the commissioner issues a final determination on the renewal.

###### Sec. 38.35.120.   Covenants required to be included in lease to a pipeline that is not a natural gas pipeline contract carrier.

(a) Except as provided for a natural gas pipeline subject to AS 38.35.121, a noncompetitive lease of state land for a right-of-way for an oil or natural gas pipeline valued at $1,000,000 or more may be granted only upon the condition that the lessee expressly covenants in the lease, in consideration of the rights acquired by it under the lease, that

(1) it assumes the status of and will perform all of its functions undertaken under the lease as a common carrier and will accept, convey, and transport without discrimination crude oil or natural gas, depending on the kind of pipeline involved, delivered to it for transportation from fields in the vicinity of the pipeline subject to the lease throughout its route both on state land obtained under the lease and on the other land; it will accept, convey, and transport crude oil or natural gas without unjust or unreasonable discrimination in favor of one producer or person, including itself, as against another but will take the crude oil or natural gas, depending on the kind of pipeline involved, delivered or offered, without unreasonable discrimination, that the Regulatory Commission of Alaska shall, after a full hearing with due notice to the interested parties and a proper finding of facts, determine to be reasonable in the performance of its duties as a common carrier; however, a lessee that owns or operates a natural gas pipeline

(A) subject to regulation either under 15 U.S.C. 717 et seq. (Natural Gas Act) or by the state or a political subdivision with respect to rates and charges for the sale of natural gas, is, to the extent of that regulation, exempt from the common carrier requirement in this paragraph;

(B) that is a North Slope natural gas pipeline (i) is required to operate as a common carrier only with respect to the intrastate transportation of North Slope natural gas, as that term is defined in AS 42.06.630, and (ii) is not required to operate as a common carrier as to a liquefied natural gas facility or a marine terminal facility associated with the pipeline, and is not otherwise required to perform its functions under the lease as a common carrier; for purposes of this subparagraph, "North Slope natural gas pipeline" means all the facilities of a total system of pipe, whether owned or operated under a contract, agreement, or lease, used by a carrier for transportation of North Slope natural gas, as defined by AS 42.06.630, for delivery, for storage, or for further transportation, and including all pipe, compressor stations, station equipment, tanks, valves, access roads, bridges, airfields, terminals and terminal facilities, including docks and tanker loading facilities, operations control centers for both the upstream part of the pipeline and the terminal, tanker ballast treatment facilities, fire protection system, communication system, and all other facilities used or necessary for an integral line of pipe, taken as a whole, to carry out transportation, including an extension or enlargement of the line;

(2) it will interchange crude oil or natural gas, depending on the kind of pipeline involved, with each like common carrier and provide connections and facilities for the interchange of crude oil or natural gas at every locality reached by both pipelines when the necessity exists, subject to rates and regulations made by the appropriate state or federal regulatory agency;

(3) it will maintain and preserve books, accounts, and records and will make those reports that the state may prescribe by regulation or law as necessary and appropriate for purposes of administration of this chapter;

(4) it will accord at all reasonable times to the state and its authorized agents and auditors the right of access to its property and records, of inspection of its property, and of examination and copying of records;

(5) it will provide connections, as determined by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska under AS 42.06.340, to facilities on the pipeline subject to the lease, both on state land and other land in the state, for the purpose of delivering crude oil or natural gas, depending on the kind of pipeline involved, to persons (including the state and its political subdivisions) contracting for the purchase at wholesale of crude oil or natural gas transported by the pipeline when required by the public interest;

(6) it shall, notwithstanding any other provision, provide connections and interchange facilities at state expense at places the state considers necessary if the state determines to take a portion of its royalty or taxes in oil or natural gas;

(7) it will construct and operate the pipeline in accordance with applicable state laws and lawful regulations and orders of the Regulatory Commission of Alaska;

(8) it will, at its own expense, during the term of the lease,

(A) maintain the leasehold and pipeline in good repair;

(B) promptly repair or remedy damage to the leasehold;

(C) promptly compensate for damage to or destruction of property for which the lessee is liable resulting from damage to or destruction of the leasehold or pipeline;

(9) it will not transfer, assign, or dispose of, in any manner, directly or indirectly, or by transfer of control of the carrier corporation, its interest in a right-of-way lease, or rights under the lease or a pipeline subject to the lease to a person other than another owner of the pipeline (including subsidiaries, parents, and affiliates of the owners), except to the extent that the commissioner, after consideration of the protection of the public interest (including whether the proposed transferee is fit, willing, and able to perform the transportation or other acts proposed in a manner that will reasonably protect the lives, property, and general welfare of the people of Alaska), authorizes; the commissioner shall not unreasonably withhold consent to the transfer, assignment, or disposal;

(10) it will file with the commissioner a written appointment of a named permanent resident of the state to be its registered agent in the state and to receive service of notices, regulations, decisions, and orders of the commissioner; if it fails to appoint an agent for service, service may be made by posting a copy in the office of the commissioner, filing a copy in the office of the lieutenant governor, and mailing a copy to the lessee's last known address;

(11) the applicable law of this state will be used in resolving questions of interpretation of the lease;

(12) the granting of the right-of-way lease is subject to the express condition that the exercise of the rights and privileges granted under the lease will not unduly interfere with the management, administration, or disposal by the state of the land affected by the lease, and that the lessee agrees and consents to the occupancy and use by the state, its grantees, permittees, or other lessees of any part of the right-of-way not actually occupied or required by the pipeline for the full and safe utilization of the pipeline, for necessary operations incident to land management, administration, or disposal;

(13) it will be liable to the state for damages or injury incurred by the state caused by the construction, operation, or maintenance of the pipeline and it will indemnify the state for the liabilities or damages;

(14) it will procure and furnish liability and property damage insurance from a company licensed to do business in the state or furnish other security or undertaking upon the terms and conditions the commissioner considers necessary if the commissioner finds that the net assets of the lessee are insufficient to protect the public from damage for which the lessee may be liable arising out of the construction or operation of the pipeline.

(b) Except as provided for a natural gas pipeline subject to AS 38.35.121, for a right-of-way lease granted under this chapter for an oil or natural gas pipeline valued at $1,000,000 or more to be valid and of legal effect, it must contain the terms required to be inserted under the provisions of AS 38.35.110§38.35.140. An oil or natural gas pipeline right-of-way lease granted under this chapter and subject to this section that does not contain the required terms is null and void and without legal effect and does not vest any interest in state land or any authority in the carrier granted the lease.

(c) The commissioner may insert in any right-of-way lease other reasonable provisions and conditions required by the public interest.

(d) The lease will also contain terms and conditions that are reasonably necessary to obligate the lessee, to the extent reasonably practicable, to

(1) prevent conflicts with other existing uses of the land involving a superior public interest;

(2) protect state and private property interests;

(3) prevent any significant adverse environmental impact, including but not limited to the erosion of the surface of the land, and damage to fish and wildlife and their habitat;

(4) restore and revegetate during the term and at termination of the lease; and

(5) protect the interests of individuals living in the general area of the right of way who rely on the fish, wildlife, and biotic resources of the area for subsistence purposes.

(e) In the event the commissioner proposes to offer a lease or leases to two or more lessees for the same pipeline, the commissioner may include terms in the lease or leases which establish the limit of the obligations and liabilities of each lessee arising under this chapter or under the lease or leases.

###### Sec. 38.35.121.   Covenants required to be in a lease to a natural gas pipeline that is a contract carrier.

(a) For a lease of state land for a right-of-way for which an applicant has applied as a contract carrier under AS 42.08, a noncompetitive lease of state land for a right-of-way for a natural gas pipeline valued at $1,000,000 or more may be granted only on the condition that the lessee expressly covenant in the lease, in consideration of the rights acquired by it under the lease, that

(1) except for the covenants in AS 38.35.120(a)(1), (2), and (5), it will meet the requirements of AS 38.35.120;

(2) it will interchange natural gas and provide connections with each public utility pipeline, common carrier pipeline, or contract carrier pipeline, and facilities for the interchange of natural gas at every locality reached by both pipelines when the necessity exists, as provided in contracts on file with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska;

(3) it assumes the status of and will perform all of its functions undertaken under the lease as a contract carrier and, subject to contracts with shippers, will accept, convey, and transport, without discrimination, natural gas delivered to it for transportation from fields in the vicinity of the pipeline subject to the right-of-way lease throughout the pipeline route, both on state land obtained under the lease and on other land, and that, subject to contracts with shippers, it will accept, convey, and transport natural gas without unjust or unreasonable discrimination in favor of itself or one producer or person against another, but will take the natural gas delivered or offered without unreasonable discrimination;

(4) it will expand the natural gas pipeline on commercially reasonable terms that, when possible, encourage exploration and development of gas resources in this state without increasing transportation costs for a shipper except as provided for in the contract with the shipper; in this paragraph, "commercially reasonable terms" means terms that produce sufficient revenue from transportation contracts to cover the cost of the expansion, including increased fuel costs and a reasonable return on capital, without impairing the ability of the pipeline to recover the costs of existing facilities;

(5) it will not require a shipper to pay a rate in excess of the rates provided for in the contract with that shipper.

(b) A contract carrier may offer to a shipper firm transportation service, interruptible transportation service, or both. In this subsection, "firm transportation service" has the meaning given in AS 42.08.900.

(c) The lessee may not construct or expand or allow the construction or expansion of a natural gas pipeline under (a) of this section to be a competing natural gas pipeline project for purposes of AS 43.90.

###### Sec. 38.35.140.   Payment of rental and costs.

(a) The lease price for a right-of-way lease shall be the annual fair market rental of the state land included in the right-of-way based on the appraised fair market value of the land.  The lease price is payable annually in advance on or before the anniversary of the lease.  The appraised fair market rental value shall be adjusted at five-year intervals and charges or adjustments shall be based on a reappraised annual rental value.  Rental may not be charged for any land acquired by the lessee under AS 38.35.130(b) and conveyed without cost to the state.

(b) The lease applicant or lessee shall reimburse the state for all reasonable costs incurred in processing an application filed under AS 38.35.050 and in monitoring the construction, operation, maintenance, and termination of the pipeline on the right-of-way.

Failure to begin construction of the pipeline facility within a reasonable time of the granting of a right-of-way lease under this chapter for reasons within the control of the lessee or failure of an owner of an interest in the granted right-of-way substantially to comply with the terms of the right-of-way shall be grounds for forfeiture of the right-of-way interest of the lessee or owner in an action brought by the commissioner in the superior court. Before the commencement of any action for forfeiture of an interest in a right-of-way under this section, the commissioner shall give the lessee or owner of the interest notice in writing of the alleged default and shall not commence the proceeding unless the lessee or owner of the interest has failed to initiate good faith efforts to cure the default within 60 days of the notice of the alleged default.

###### Sec. 38.35.180.   Suits to enjoin or recover damages for defaults.
