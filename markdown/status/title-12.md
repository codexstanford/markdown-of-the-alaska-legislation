(2) on its own motion or on the motion of the party presenting the witness or the guardian ad litem of the child, may order that the testimony of the child be taken by closed circuit television or through one-way mirrors if the court determines that the testimony by the child victim or witness under normal court procedures would result in the child's inability to effectively communicate.

(b) In making a determination under (a)(2) of this section, the court shall consider factors it considers relevant, including

(1) the child's chronological age;

(2) the child's level of development;

(3) the child's general physical health;

(4) any physical, emotional, or psychological injury experienced by the child; and

(5) the mental or emotional strain that will be caused by requiring the child to testify under normal courtroom procedures.

(c) If the court determines under (a)(2) of this section that the testimony by the child victim or witness under normal court procedures would result in the child's inability to effectively communicate, the court may order that the testimony of the child be taken in a room other than the courtroom and be televised by closed circuit equipment in the courtroom to be viewed by the defendant, the court, and the finder of fact in the proceeding.

Upon request of the defendant or the defendant's attorney, the court shall permit a recess to allow them to confer. The court shall provide a means of communicating with the attorneys during the questioning of the child. Objections made by the attorneys to questions of a child witness may be resolved in the courtroom if the court finds it necessary.

(e) If the court determines under (a)(2) of this section that the testimony by the child victim or witness under normal court procedures would result in the child's inability to effectively communicate, the court may authorize the use of one-way mirrors in conjunction with the taking of the child's testimony. The attorneys may pose questions to the child and have visual contact with the child during questioning, but the mirrors shall be placed to provide a physical shield so that the child does not have visual contact with the defendant and jurors.

(f) If the court does not find under (a)(2) of this section that the testimony by the child victim or witness under normal court procedures will result in the child's inability to effectively communicate, the court may, after taking into consideration the factors specified in (b) of this section, supervise the spatial arrangements of the courtroom and the location, movement, and deportment of all persons in attendance so as to safeguard the child from emotional harm or stress. In addition to other procedures it finds appropriate, the court may

(1) allow the child to testify while sitting on the floor or on an appropriately sized chair;

(2) schedule the procedure in a room that provides adequate privacy, freedom from distractions, informality, and comfort appropriate to the child's developmental age; and

With the material excised, the court shall then direct delivery of the statement to the defendant for the use of the defendant. If, pursuant to this procedure, any portion of the statement is withheld from the defendant and the defendant objects to the withholding, and the trial is continued to an adjudication of the guilt of the defendant, the entire text of the statement shall be preserved by the state and, in the event the defendant appeals, shall be made available to the appellate court for the purpose of determining the correctness of the ruling of the trial judge.

(a) In a prosecution for a crime, it is an affirmative defense that when the defendant engaged in the criminal conduct, the defendant was unable, as a result of a mental disease or defect, to appreciate the nature and quality of that conduct.

(b) The affirmative defense defined in (a) of this section may not be raised at trial unless the defendant, within 10 days of entering a plea or such later time as the court may for good cause permit, files a written notice of intent to rely on the defense.

(c) Evidence of a mental disease or defect that is manifested only by repeated criminal or other antisocial conduct is not sufficient to establish the affirmative defense under (a) of this section.

(d) The affirmative defense specified in (a) of this section is the affirmative defense of insanity.  A defendant who successfully raises the affirmative defense of insanity shall be found not guilty by reason of insanity and the verdict shall so state.

###### Sec. 12.47.020.   Mental disease or defect negating culpable mental state.

(a) Evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect is admissible whenever it is relevant to prove that the defendant did or did not have a culpable mental state which is an element of the crime.  However, evidence of mental disease or defect that tends to negate a culpable mental state is not admissible unless the defendant, within 10 days of entering a plea, or at such later time as the court may for good cause permit, files a written notice of intent to rely on that defense.

(b) When the trier of fact finds that all other elements of the crime have been proved but, as a result of mental disease or defect, there is a reasonable doubt as to the existence of a culpable mental state that is an element of the crime, it shall enter a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.  A defendant acquitted under this subsection, and not found guilty of a lesser included offense, shall automatically be considered to have established the affirmative defense of insanity under AS 12.47.010. The defendant is then subject to the provisions of AS 12.47.090.

(c) If a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity is reached under (b) of this section, the trier of fact shall also consider whether the defendant is guilty of any lesser included offense.  If the defendant is convicted of a lesser included offense, the defendant shall be sentenced for that offense and shall automatically be considered guilty but mentally ill under AS 12.47.030 and 12.47.050. Upon completion of a sentence for a lesser included offense, a hearing shall be held under AS 12.47.090(c) to determine the necessity of further commitment of the defendant, based on the acquittal for the greater charge under (b) of this section.  If the defendant is committed under AS 12.47.090(c), the defendant is subject to the provisions of AS 12.47.090(d)§(i) and (k).

###### Sec. 12.47.030.   Guilty but mentally ill.

(a) A defendant is guilty but mentally ill if, when the defendant engaged in the criminal conduct, the defendant lacked, as a result of a mental disease or defect, the substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of that conduct or to conform that conduct to the requirements of law.  A defendant found guilty but mentally ill is not relieved of criminal responsibility for criminal conduct and is subject to the provisions of AS 12.47.050.

(b) Evidence of a mental disease or defect that is manifested only by repeated criminal or antisocial conduct is not sufficient to establish that the defendant was guilty but mentally ill under (a) of this section.

###### Sec. 12.47.040.   Form of verdict in certain cases involving insanity or mental disease or defect.

(a) In a prosecution for a crime when the affirmative defense of insanity is raised under AS 12.47.010, or when evidence of a mental disease or defect of the defendant is otherwise admissible at trial under AS 12.47.020, the trier of fact shall find, and the verdict shall state, whether the defendant is

(1) guilty;

(2) not guilty;

(3) not guilty by reason of insanity; or

(4) guilty but mentally ill.

(b) To return a verdict under (a)(4) of this section, the fact finder must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime and that, when the defendant committed the crime, the defendant was guilty but mentally ill as defined in AS 12.47.030.

(c) When the jury is instructed as to the verdicts under (a) of this section, it shall also be instructed on the dispositions available under AS 12.47.050 and 12.47.090.

###### Sec. 12.47.050.   Disposition of defendant found guilty but mentally ill.

(a) If the trier of fact finds that a defendant is guilty but mentally ill, the court shall sentence the defendant as provided by law and shall enter the verdict of guilty but mentally ill as part of the judgment.

(b) The Department of Corrections shall provide mental health treatment to a defendant found guilty but mentally ill. The treatment must continue until the defendant no longer suffers from a mental disease or defect that causes the defendant to be dangerous to the public peace or safety.  Subject to (c) and (d) of this section, the Department of Corrections shall determine the course of treatment.

(c) When treatment terminates under (b) of this section, the defendant shall be required to serve the remainder of the sentence imposed.

(d) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, a defendant receiving treatment under (b) of this section may not be released

(1) on furlough under AS 33.30.101§33.30.131, except for treatment in a secure setting; or

(2) on parole.

(e) Not less than 30 days before the expiration of the sentence of a defendant found guilty but mentally ill, the commissioner of corrections shall file a petition under AS 47.30.700 for a screening investigation to determine the need for further treatment of the defendant if

(1) the defendant is still receiving treatment under (b) of this section; and

(2) the commissioner has good cause to believe that the defendant is suffering from a mental illness that causes the defendant to be dangerous to the public peace or safety; in this paragraph, "mental illness" has the meaning given in AS 47.30.915.

###### Sec. 12.47.055.   Treatment for other defendants not limited.

Nothing in AS 12.47.050 limits the discretion of the court to recommend, or of the Department of Corrections to provide, psychiatrically indicated treatment for a defendant who is not adjudged guilty but mentally ill.

###### Sec. 12.47.060.   Post conviction determination of mental illness.

(a) In a prosecution for a crime when the affirmative defense of insanity is not raised and when evidence of mental disease or defect of the defendant is not admitted at trial under AS 12.47.020, the defendant or the prosecuting attorney may raise the issue of whether the defendant is guilty but mentally ill. A party that seeks a post-conviction determination of guilty but mentally ill must give notice 10 days before trial of intent to do so; however, this deadline is waived if the opposing party presents evidence or argument at trial tending to show that the defendant may be guilty but mentally ill. A hearing must be held on this issue before the same fact finder that returned the verdict of guilty under procedures set by the court. In cases decided by a jury, at the request of the defendant and with the concurrence of the prosecuting attorney, the court may decide the issue. A waiver of consideration by a jury must be in writing and in person before the court. At the hearing, the fact finder shall determine whether the defendant has been shown to be guilty but mentally ill beyond a reasonable doubt, considering evidence presented at the hearing and any evidence relevant to the issue that was presented at trial.

(b) If the fact finder finds that a defendant is guilty but mentally ill, the court shall sentence the defendant as provided by law and shall enter the finding of guilty but mentally ill as part of the judgment.

(c) A defendant determined to be guilty but mentally ill under this section is subject to the provisions of AS 12.47.050.

(d) In this section, "guilty but mentally ill" has the meaning given in AS 12.47.030.

###### Sec. 12.47.070.   Psychiatric examination.

(a) If a defendant has filed a notice of intention to rely on the affirmative defense of insanity under AS 12.47.010 or has filed notice under AS 12.47.020(a), or there is reason to doubt the defendant's fitness to proceed, or there is reason to believe that a mental disease or defect of the defendant will otherwise become an issue in the case, the court shall appoint at least two qualified psychiatrists or two forensic psychologists certified by the American Board of Forensic Psychology to examine and report upon the mental condition of the defendant.  If the court appoints psychiatrists, the psychiatrists may select psychologists to provide assistance. If the defendant has filed notice under AS 12.47.090(a), the report shall consider whether the defendant can still be committed under AS 12.47.090(c).  The court may order the defendant to be committed to a secure facility for the purpose of the examination for not more than 60 days or such longer period as the court determines to be necessary for the purpose and may direct that a qualified psychiatrist retained by the defendant be permitted to witness and participate in the examination.

(b) In an examination under (a) of this section, any method may be employed which is accepted by the medical profession for the examination of those alleged to be suffering from mental disease or defect.

(c) The report of an examination under (a) of this section shall include the following:

(1) a description of the nature of the examination;

(2) a diagnosis of the mental condition of the defendant;

(3) if the defendant suffers from a mental disease or defect, an opinion as to the defendant's capacity to understand the proceedings against the defendant and to assist in the defendant's defense;

(4) if a notice of intention to rely on the affirmative defense of insanity under AS 12.47.010(b) has been filed, an opinion as to the extent, if any, to which the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the nature and quality of the defendant's conduct was impaired at the time of the crime charged; and

(5) if notice has been filed under AS 12.47.020(a), an opinion as to the capacity of the defendant to have a culpable mental state which is an element of the crime charged.

(d) If the examination under (a) of this section cannot be conducted by reason of the unwillingness of the defendant to participate in it, the report shall so state and shall include, if possible, an opinion as to whether the unwillingness of the defendant was the result of mental disease or defect.

(e) The report of the examination under (a) of this section shall be filed with the clerk of the court, who shall cause copies to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for the defendant.

###### Sec. 12.47.080.   Procedure upon verdict of not guilty.

(a) If a defendant is found not guilty under AS 12.47.040(a)(2), the prosecuting attorney shall, within 24 hours, file a petition under AS 47.30.700 for a screening investigation to determine the need for treatment if the prosecuting attorney has good cause to believe that the defendant is suffering from a mental illness and as a result is gravely disabled or likely to cause serious harm to self or others.

(b) In this section, "mental illness" has the meaning given in AS 47.30.915.

###### Sec. 12.47.090.   Procedure after raising defense of insanity.

(a) At the time the defendant files notice to raise the affirmative defense of insanity under AS 12.47.010 or files notice under AS 12.47.020(a), the defendant shall also file notice as to whether, if found not guilty by reason of insanity under AS 12.47.010 or 12.47.020(b), the defendant will assert that the defendant is not presently suffering from any mental illness that causes the defendant to be dangerous to the public peace or safety.

(b) If the defendant is found not guilty by reason of insanity under AS 12.47.010 or 12.47.020(b), and has not filed the notice required under (a) of this section, the court shall immediately commit the defendant to the custody of the commissioner of family and community services.

(c) If the defendant is found not guilty by reason of insanity under AS 12.47.010 or 12.47.020(b), and has filed the notice required under (a) of this section, a hearing shall be held immediately after a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity to determine the necessity of commitment. The hearing shall be held before the same trier of fact as heard the underlying charge. At the hearing, the defendant has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is not presently suffering from any mental illness that causes the defendant to be dangerous to the public. If the court or jury determines that the defendant has failed to meet the burden of proof, the court shall order the defendant committed to the custody of the commissioner of family and community services. If the hearing is before a jury, the verdict must be unanimous.

(d) A defendant committed under (b) or (c) of this section shall be held in custody for a period of time not to exceed the maximum term of imprisonment for the crime for which the defendant was acquitted under AS 12.47.010 or 12.47.020(b) or until the mental illness is cured or corrected as determined at a hearing under (e) of this section.

(e) A defendant committed under (b) or (c) of this section may have the need for continuing commitment under this section reviewed by the court sitting without a jury under a petition filed in the superior court at intervals beginning no sooner than a year from the defendant's initial commitment, and yearly thereafter. The burden and standard of proof at a hearing under this subsection are the same as at a hearing under (c) of this section. A copy of all petitions for release shall be served on the attorney general at Juneau, Alaska. A copy shall also be served upon the attorney of record, if the attorney of record is not the attorney general, who represented the state or a municipality at the time the defendant was first committed.

(f) Continued commitment following expiration of the maximum term of imprisonment for the crime for which the defendant was acquitted under AS 12.47.010 or 12.47.020(b) is governed by the standards pertaining to civil commitments as set out in AS 47.30.735.

(g) A person committed under this section may not be released during the term of commitment except upon court order following a hearing in accordance with (e) of this section. On the grounds that the defendant has been cured of any mental illness that would cause the defendant to be dangerous to the public peace or safety, the state may at any time request the court to hold a hearing to decide if the defendant should be released.

(h) The commissioner of family and community services or the commissioner's authorized representative shall submit periodic written reports to the court on the mental condition of a person committed under this section.

(i) An order entered under (c) or (e) of this section may be reviewed by the court of appeals on appeal brought by either the defendant or the state within 40 days from the entry of the order.

(j) If the court finds that a defendant committed under (b) or (c) of this section can be adequately controlled and treated in the community with proper supervision, the court may order the defendant conditionally released from confinement under AS 12.47.092 for a period of time not to exceed the maximum term of imprisonment for the crime for which the defendant was acquitted under AS 12.47.010 or 12.47.020(b) or until the mental illness is cured or corrected, whichever first occurs, as determined at a hearing under (c) of this section.

(k) In this section,

(1) "dangerous" means a determination involving both the magnitude of the risk that the defendant will commit an act threatening the public peace or safety, as well as the magnitude of the harm that could be expected to result from this conduct; a finding that a defendant is "dangerous" may result from a great risk of relatively slight harm to persons or property, or may result from a relatively slight risk of substantial harm to persons or property;

(2) "mental illness" means any mental condition that increases the propensity of the defendant to be dangerous to the public peace or safety; however, it is not required that the mental illness be sufficient to exclude criminal responsibility under AS 12.47.010, or that the mental illness presently suffered by the defendant be the same one the defendant suffered at the time of the criminal conduct.

###### Sec. 12.47.092.   Procedure for conditional release.

(a) A defendant committed to the custody of the commissioner of family and community services under AS 12.47.090(b) or (c) may be conditionally released from confinement subject to the conditions and requirements for treatment that the court may impose, and placed under the supervision of the Department of Family and Community Services, a local government agency, a private agency, or an adult, who agrees to assume supervision of the defendant.

(b) The commissioner of family and community services or the commissioner's authorized representative shall submit, at a minimum, quarterly written reports to the court describing the defendant's progress in treatment, compliance with conditions of release, and other information required by the court for defendants conditionally released under this section.

(c) A person or agency responsible for supervision or treatment under an order for conditional release shall immediately notify the commissioner of family and community services upon the defendant's failure to appear for required medication or treatment, or for failure to comply with other conditions imposed by the court.

(d) If the court, after petition or on its own motion, reasonably believes that a conditionally released defendant is failing to adhere to the terms and conditions of the conditional release, the court may order that the conditionally released defendant be apprehended and held until a hearing can be scheduled with the court to determine the facts and whether or not the defendant's conditional release should be revoked or modified. Nothing in this subsection is intended to limit procedures available for emergency situations, including emergency detention under AS 47.30.705.

(e) The commissioner of family and community services or the conditionally released defendant may petition the court for modification of an order of conditional release. A petition by the defendant for modification of conditional release may not be filed more often than once every six months.

(f) A defendant conditionally released under AS 12.47.090(j) may petition the court for discharge in accordance with AS 12.47.090(e).

###### Sec. 12.47.095.   Notice to victims.

(a) If an offender has been committed to the custody of the commissioner of family and community services under AS 12.47.090, the victim of that crime is entitled to notice of a pending or actual change in the status of the offender. The commissioner of family and community services shall give notice as required by this section if

(1) the offender has been continued in commitment following expiration of the maximum term of imprisonment under AS 12.47.090(f) and the commissioner gives notice of release of the offender;

(2) the court is to consider modification of an order of conditional release for the offender under AS 12.47.092(e);

(3) a court is to consider conditional release of the offender under AS 12.47.090(j) and 12.47.092(a);

(4) the offender petitions for discharge under AS 12.47.092(f); or

(5) the offender escapes, is released from custody on conditional release, furlough or authorized absence, or is discharged or released from custody for any reason.

(b) If a victim desires notice under this section, the victim shall maintain a current, valid mailing address on file with the commissioner of family and community services. The commissioner shall send the notice required by this section to the victim's last known address. The victim's address may not be disclosed to the offender or offender's attorney.

(c) The commissioner of family and community services is required to give notice of a change in the status of an offender under this section to any victim who has requested notice.

(d) If more than one person who qualifies as a victim under AS 12.55.185 desires notice, the commissioner of family and community services shall designate one person for purposes of receiving any notice required and exercising the rights granted by this section.

(e) A victim who has received notice under (a) of this section that a change in the status of the offender is pending before a court has the right to submit to the court a written statement, or to appear personally at a hearing to present a written statement, and to give sworn testimony or an unsworn oral presentation to the court.

(f) In this section,

(1) "offender" has the meaning given in AS 12.61.020;

(2) "victim" has the meaning given in AS 12.55.185.

###### Sec. 12.47.100.   Incompetency to proceed.

(a) A defendant who, as a result of mental disease or defect, is incompetent because the defendant is unable to understand the proceedings against the defendant or to assist in the defendant's own defense may not be tried, convicted, or sentenced for the commission of a crime so long as the incompetency exists.

(b) If, before imposition of sentence, the prosecuting attorney or the attorney for the defendant has reasonable cause to believe that the defendant is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect that causes the defendant to be unable to understand the proceedings or to assist in the person's own defense, the attorney may file a motion for a judicial determination of the competency of the defendant. Upon that motion, or upon its own motion, the court shall have the defendant examined by at least one qualified psychiatrist or psychologist, who shall report to the court concerning the competency of the defendant. For the purpose of the examination, the court may order the defendant committed for a reasonable period to a suitable hospital or other facility designated by the court. If the report of the psychiatrist or psychologist indicates that the defendant is incompetent, the court shall hold a hearing, upon due notice, at which evidence as to the competency of the defendant may be submitted, including that of the reporting psychiatrist or psychologist, and make appropriate findings. Before the hearing, the court shall, upon request of the prosecuting attorney, order the defendant to submit to an additional evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist designated by the prosecuting attorney.

(c) A defendant is presumed to be competent. The party raising the issue of competency bears the burden of proving the defendant is incompetent by a preponderance of the evidence. When the court raises the issue of competency, the burden of proving the defendant is incompetent shall be on the party who elects to advocate for a finding of incompetency. The court shall then apply the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine whether the defendant is competent.

(d) A statement made by the defendant in the course of an examination into the person's competency under this section, whether the examination is with or without the consent of the defendant, may not be admitted in evidence against the defendant on the issue of guilt in a criminal proceeding unless the defendant later relies on a defense under AS 12.47.010 or 12.47.020. A finding by the judge that the defendant is competent to stand trial in no way prejudices the defendant in a defense based on insanity; the finding may not be introduced in evidence on that issue or otherwise be brought to the notice of the jury.

(e) In determining whether a person has sufficient intellectual functioning to adapt or cope with the ordinary demands of life, the court shall consider whether the person has obtained a driver's license, is able to maintain employment, or is competent to testify as a witness under the Alaska Rules of Evidence.

(f) In determining if the defendant is unable to understand the proceedings against the defendant, the court shall consider, among other factors considered relevant by the court, whether the defendant understands that the defendant has been charged with a criminal offense and that penalties can be imposed; whether the defendant understands what criminal conduct is being alleged; whether the defendant understands the roles of the judge, jury, prosecutor, and defense counsel; whether the defendant understands that the defendant will be expected to tell defense counsel the circumstances, to the best of the defendant's ability, surrounding the defendant's activities at the time of the alleged criminal conduct; and whether the defendant can distinguish between a guilty and not guilty plea.

(g) In determining if the defendant is unable to assist in the defendant's own defense, the court shall consider, among other factors considered relevant by the court, whether the defendant's mental disease or defect affects the defendant's ability to recall and relate facts pertaining to the defendant's actions at times relevant to the charges and whether the defendant can respond coherently to counsel's questions. A defendant is able to assist in the defense even though the defendant's memory may be impaired, the defendant refuses to accept a course of action that counsel or the court believes is in the defendant's best interest, or the defendant is unable to suggest a particular strategy or to choose among alternative defenses.

(h) In a hearing to determine competency under this section, the court may, at the court's discretion, allow a witness, including a psychiatrist or psychologist who examined the defendant, to testify concerning the competency of the defendant by contemporaneous two-way video conference if the witness is in a place from which people customarily travel by air to the court, and the procedure allows the parties a fair opportunity to examine the witness. The video conference technician shall be the only person in the presence of the witness unless the court, at the court's discretion, determines that another person may be present. Any person present with the witness must be identified on the record. In this subsection, "contemporaneous two-way video conference"

(1) means a conference among people at different places by means of transmitted audio and video signals;

(2) includes all communication technologies that allow people at two or more places to interact by two-way video and audio transmissions simultaneously.

###### Sec. 12.47.110.   Commitment on finding of incompetency.

(a) When the trial court determines by a preponderance of the evidence, in accordance with AS 12.47.100, that a defendant is so incompetent that the defendant is unable to understand the proceedings against the defendant or to assist in the defendant's own defense, the court shall order the proceedings stayed, except as provided in (d) of this section, and shall commit a defendant charged with a felony, and may commit a defendant charged with any other crime, to the custody of the commissioner of family and community services or the commissioner's authorized representative for further evaluation and treatment until the defendant is mentally competent to stand trial, or until the pending charges against the defendant are disposed of according to law, but in no event longer than 90 days.

(b) On or before the expiration of the initial 90-day period of commitment, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether or not the defendant remains incompetent. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant remains incompetent, the court may recommit the defendant for a second period of 90 days. The court shall determine at the expiration of the second 90-day period whether the defendant has become competent. If, at the expiration of the second 90-day period, the court determines that the defendant continues to be incompetent to stand trial, the charges against the defendant shall be dismissed without prejudice, and continued commitment of the defendant shall be governed by the provisions relating to civil commitments under AS 47.30.700§47.30.915 unless the defendant is charged with a crime involving force against a person and the court finds that the defendant presents a substantial danger of physical injury to other persons and that there is a substantial probability that the defendant will regain competency within a reasonable period of time, in which case the court may extend the period of commitment for an additional six months. If the defendant remains incompetent at the expiration of the additional six-month period, the charges shall be dismissed without prejudice, and continued commitment proceedings shall be governed by the provisions relating to civil commitment under AS 47.30.700§47.30.915. If the defendant remains incompetent for five years after the charges have been dismissed under this subsection, the defendant may not be charged again for an offense arising out of the facts alleged in the original charges, except if the original charge is a class A felony or unclassified felony.

(c) The defendant is not responsible for the expenses of hospitalization or transportation incurred as a result of the defendant's commitment under this section. Liability for payment under AS 47.30.910 does not apply to commitments under this section.

(d) A defendant receiving medication for either a physical or a mental condition may not be prohibited from standing trial, if the medication either enables the defendant to understand the proceedings and to properly assist in the defendant's defense or does not disable the defendant from understanding the proceedings and assisting in the defendant's own defense.

(e) A defendant charged with a felony and found to be incompetent to proceed under this section is rebuttably presumed to be mentally ill and to present a likelihood of serious harm to self or others in proceedings under AS 47.30.700§47.30.915. In evaluating whether a defendant is likely to cause serious harm, the court may consider as recent behavior the conduct with which the defendant was originally charged.

###### Sec. 12.47.120.   Determination of sanity after commitment.

(a) When, in the medical judgment of the custodian of an accused person committed under AS 12.47.110, the accused is considered to be mentally competent to stand trial, the committing court shall hold a hearing, after due notice, as soon as conveniently possible.  At the hearing, evidence as to the mental condition of the accused may be submitted including reports by the custodian to whom the accused was committed for care.

(b) If at the hearing the court determines that the accused is presently mentally competent to understand the nature of the proceedings against the accused and to assist in the accused's own defense, appropriate criminal proceedings may be commenced against the accused.

(c) If at the hearing the court determines that the accused is still presently mentally incompetent, the court shall recommit the accused in accordance with AS 12.47.110.

(d) A finding by the court that the accused is mentally competent to stand trial in no way prejudices the accused in a defense based on mental disease or defect excluding responsibility. This finding may not be introduced in evidence on that issue or otherwise brought to the notice of the jury.

## Chapter 50. Witnesses.

###### Sec. 12.50.010.   Witness subpoenaed in this state to testify in another state.

(a) If a judge of a court of record in any state which by its laws has made provision for commanding persons within the state to attend and testify in this state certifies under the seal of the court that there is a criminal prosecution pending in the court, or that a grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence, that a person within this state is a material witness in that prosecution or grand jury investigation, and that the presence of that person will be required for a specified number of days, then, upon presentation of the certificate to a judge of a court of record in the judicial district in which the person is, the judge shall fix a time and place for a hearing and shall make an order directing the witness to appear at a time and place certain for the hearing.

(b) If at a hearing the judge determines that the witness is material and necessary, that it will not cause undue hardship to the witness to be compelled to attend and testify in the prosecution or grand jury investigation in the other state, and that the laws of the state in which the prosecution is pending or grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence will give to the witness protection from arrest and the service of civil and criminal process, the judge shall issue a subpoena, with a copy of the certificate attached, directing the witness to attend and testify in the court where the prosecution is pending or where a grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence at a time and place specified in the subpoena.  In any such hearing the certificate shall be prima facie evidence of all of the facts stated therein.

(c) If the certificate recommends that the witness be taken into immediate custody and delivered to an officer of the requesting state to assure attendance in the requesting state, the judge may, in lieu of notification of the hearing, direct that the witness be immediately brought before the judge for said hearing; and if the judge at the hearing is satisfied of the desirability of the custody and delivery, for which determination the certificate shall be prima facie proof of this desirability, the judge may, in lieu of issuing subpoena, order that the witness be immediately taken into custody and delivered to an officer of the requesting state.

#### Article 2. Witness Immunity.

###### Sec. 12.50.101.   Immunity of witnesses.

(a) If a witness refuses, on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or provide other information in a criminal proceeding before or ancillary to a court or grand jury of this state, and a judge issues an order under (b) of this section, the witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination. If the witness fully complies with the order, the witness may not be prosecuted for an offense about which the witness is compelled to testify, except in a prosecution based on perjury, giving a false statement or otherwise knowingly providing false information, or hindering prosecution.

(b) In the case of an individual who has been or may be called to testify or provide other information in a criminal proceeding before or ancillary to a court or a grand jury of this state, a superior or district court for the judicial district in which the proceeding is or may be held shall issue, upon the application of the attorney general or the attorney general's designee in accordance with (d) of this section, an order requiring the individual to give testimony or provide other information that the individual refuses to give or provide based on the privilege against self-incrimination.

(c) An order issued under (b) of this section is effective when communicated to the individual specified in the order.

(d) The attorney general or the attorney general's designee may apply for an order under (b) of this section when, in the judgment of the attorney general or the attorney general's designee,

(1) the testimony or other information may be necessary to the administration of criminal justice; and

(2) the individual who is the subject of the application has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or to provide other information on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination.

(e) If a witness refuses, or there is reason to believe the witness will refuse, to testify or provide other information based on the privilege against self-incrimination, and if the attorney general or the attorney general's designee has not applied for an order under (b) of this section, the court shall inform the witness of the right to be represented by an attorney, and that an attorney will be appointed for the witness if the witness qualifies for counsel under AS 18.85. The court shall recess the proceeding to allow the witness to consult with the attorney for the witness.

(f) If the attorney general or the attorney general's designee declines to seek an order under (b) of this section after the witness has had an opportunity to consult with an attorney, and the witness continues to refuse to testify or provide other information, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the validity of the claim of privilege by the witness. The hearing shall be in camera.

(g) At the hearing under (f) of this section, the attorney for the witness, in the form of a proffer, shall describe the testimony or other information that the witness claims is privileged. The proffer must include a description of how the testimony or other information could connect the witness with a crime. The proffer is privileged and inadmissible for any other purpose. If the proffer establishes a factual basis that there is a real or substantial danger that the testimony or other information to be compelled would support a conviction or would furnish a link in the chain of evidence leading to conviction for a crime, the court may find that the witness has a valid claim of privilege.

(h) If the court finds that the witness has a valid claim of privilege, it shall advise an attorney designated by the attorney general of that finding and inform the attorney of the category or categories of offense to which the privilege applies: a higher-level felony, a lower-level felony, or a misdemeanor. If the designated attorney decides that granting immunity to the witness is appropriate, the designated attorney shall inform the prosecution of that decision, and shall deliver or cause to be delivered a letter to the witness, or an attorney for the witness, granting immunity to the witness. The designated attorney may not disclose the category of offense to anyone.

(i) In this section,

(1) the person witnessed or was at or near the scene of the commission of a felony crime against a person under AS 11.41, arson under AS 11.46.400 or 11.46.410, criminal mischief under AS 11.46.475 or 11.46.480, or misconduct involving weapons under AS 11.61.190 or 11.61.195(a)(3);

(2) the person has information of material aid in the investigation of that crime; and

(3) the temporary detention of the person is reasonably necessary to obtain or verify the identification of the person, to obtain an account of the crime, to protect a crime victim from imminent harm, or for other exigent circumstances.

(b) A peace officer who temporarily detains a person under (a) of this section may

(1) detain the person only as long as reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes of that subsection;

(2) take one or more photographs of the person, if photographs can be taken without unreasonably delaying the person or removing the person from the vicinity; and

(3) if the person does not provide valid government-issued photographic identification or other valid identification that the officer finds to be reliable to identify the person, or the officer has reasonable suspicion that the identification is not valid,

(A) serve a subpoena on the person to appear before the grand jury where the crime was committed; and

(B) take the person's fingerprint impressions if

(i) the crime under investigation is murder, attempted murder, or misconduct involving weapons under AS 11.61.190 or 11.61.195(a)(3); and

(ii) fingerprint impressions can be taken without unreasonably delaying the person or removing the person from the vicinity.

(c) A peace officer electing to serve a subpoena under (b) of this section may not require the person to sign the subpoena or another document. The officer or the subpoena must advise the person that failure to honor the subpoena may be punishable as criminal contempt of court under AS 09.50.010. A person receiving a subpoena to testify under (b) of this section may request the district attorney to withdraw the subpoena if, before the grand jury proceeding for which the person has been served a subpoena to appear, the person provides the peace officer who served the subpoena or the lead investigator with valid government-issued photographic identification or other valid identification that the officer or lead investigator finds to be reliable to identify the person.

(d) Photographs or fingerprints taken under (b) of this section

(1) may be used for identification purposes only, and not for criminal investigative purposes unless it is determined that the person is suspected of committing a crime within the scope of the investigation; and

(2) must be destroyed upon the earlier of the following occurrences unless it is determined that the person is suspected of committing a crime within the scope of the investigation:

(A) the person has testified in a grand jury or court proceeding in connection with the matter under investigation; or

(B) completion of the prosecution of the crime being investigated.

(e) This section does not limit the authority of peace officers to investigate crimes, to collect evidence, to photograph crime scenes, evidence, or bystanders, to issue lawful court process, or to ensure the welfare of crime victims or other persons.

## Chapter 55. Sentencing and Probation.

###### Sec. 12.55.005.   Declaration of purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide the means for determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon conviction of an offense. The legislature finds that the elimination of unjustified disparity in sentences and the attainment of reasonable uniformity in sentences can best be achieved through a sentencing framework fixed by statute as provided in this chapter. In imposing sentence, the court shall consider

(1) the seriousness of the defendant's present offense in relation to other offenses;

(2) the prior criminal history of the defendant and the likelihood of rehabilitation;

(3) the need to confine the defendant to prevent further harm to the public;

(4) the circumstances of the offense and the extent to which the offense harmed the victim or endangered the public safety or order;

(5) the effect of the sentence to be imposed in deterring the defendant or other members of society from future criminal conduct;

(6) the effect of the sentence to be imposed as a community condemnation of the criminal act and as a reaffirmation of societal norms; and

(7) the restoration of the victim and the community.

###### Sec. 12.55.010.   Imprisonment on judgment for payment of fine. [Repealed,§21 ch 166 SLA 1978. For present provisions, see AS 12.55.035(a).]

###### Sec. 12.55.011.   Victim and community involvement in sentencing.

(a) A court, when considering the sentence to be imposed under this chapter for an offense other than a violation of AS 11.41, AS 11.46.400, or a crime involving domestic violence, may permit the victim and the offender to submit a sentence for the court's review based upon a negotiated agreement between the victim and the offender, or between the offender and the community if there is no victim. The court may, with the consent of the victim and the offender, impose the sentence that has been determined by the negotiated agreement between the offender and the victim, or between the offender and the community if there is no victim, if that sentence otherwise complies with this chapter and accomplishes the goals of restoration of the victim and the community and rehabilitation of the offender. Before accepting a negotiated agreement, the court shall determine that the victim has not been intimidated or coerced in reaching the agreement. In this section, "community" has the meaning determined by the court.

(b) At the time of sentencing, the court shall, if practicable, provide the victim with a form that

(1) provides information on

(A) whom the victim should contact if the victim has questions about the sentence or release of the offender;

(B) the potential for release of the offender on furlough, probation, or parole or for good time credit; and

(2) allows the victim to update the victim's contact information with the court, the Victim Information and Notification Everyday service, and the Department of Corrections.

###### Sec. 12.55.015.   Authorized sentences; forfeiture.

(a) Except as limited by AS 12.55.125§12.55.175, the court, in imposing sentence on a defendant convicted of an offense, may singly or in combination

(1) impose a fine when authorized by law and as provided in AS 12.55.035;

(2) order the defendant to be placed on probation under conditions specified by the court that may include provision for active supervision;

(3) impose a definite term of periodic imprisonment, but only if an employment obligation of the defendant preexisted sentencing and the defendant receives a composite sentence of not more than two years to serve;

(4) impose a definite term of continuous imprisonment;

(5) order the defendant to make restitution under AS 12.55.045;

(6) order the defendant to carry out a continuous or periodic program of community work under AS 12.55.055;

(7) suspend execution of all or a portion of the sentence imposed under AS 12.55.080;

(8) suspend entry of judgment under AS 12.55.078 or suspend imposition of sentence under AS 12.55.085;

(9) order the forfeiture to the commissioner of public safety or a municipal law enforcement agency of a deadly weapon that was in the actual possession of or used by the defendant during the commission of an offense described in AS 11.41, AS 11.46, AS 11.56, or AS 11.61;

(10) order the defendant, while incarcerated, to participate in or comply with the treatment plan of a rehabilitation program that is related to the defendant's offense or to the defendant's rehabilitation if the program is made available to the defendant by the Department of Corrections;

(11) order the forfeiture to the state of a motor vehicle, weapon, electronic communication device, or money or other valuables, used in or obtained through an offense that was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang;

(12) order the defendant to have no contact, either directly or indirectly, with a victim or witness of the offense until the defendant is unconditionally discharged;

(13) order the defendant to refrain from consuming alcoholic beverages for a period of time.

(b) The court, in exercising sentencing discretion as provided in this chapter, shall impose a sentence involving imprisonment when

(1) the defendant deserves to be imprisoned, considering the seriousness of the present offense and the defendant's prior criminal history, and imprisonment is equitable considering sentences imposed for other offenses and other defendants under similar circumstances;

(2) imprisonment is necessary to protect the public from further harm by the defendant; or

(3) sentences of lesser severity have been repeatedly imposed for substantially similar offenses in the past and have proven ineffective in deterring the defendant from further criminal conduct.

(c) In addition to the penalties authorized by this section, the court may invoke any authority conferred by law to order a forfeiture of property, suspend or revoke a license, remove a person from office, or impose any other civil penalty. When forfeiting property under this subsection, a court may award to a municipal law enforcement agency that participated in the arrest or conviction of the defendant, the seizure of property, or the identification of property for seizure, (1) the property if the property is worth $5,000 or less and is not money or some other thing that is divisible, or (2) up to 75 percent of the property or the value of the property if the property is worth more than $5,000 or is money or some other thing that is divisible. In determining the percentage a municipal law enforcement agency may receive under this subsection, the court shall consider the municipal law enforcement agency's total involvement in the case relative to the involvement of the state.

(d) [Repealed,§1 ch 188 SLA 1990.]

(e) If the defendant is ordered to serve a definite term of imprisonment, the court may recommend that the defendant serve all or part of the term

(1) in a correctional restitution center;

(2) by electronic monitoring.

(f) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, the court shall order the forfeiture to the commissioner of public safety or a municipal law enforcement agency of a deadly weapon that was in the actual possession of or used by the defendant during the commission of a crime involving domestic violence.

(g) Unless a defendant is ineligible for a deduction under AS 33.20, when a defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years or more, the sentence consists of two parts: (1) a minimum term of imprisonment that is equal to not less than two-thirds of the total term of imprisonment; and (2) a maximum term of supervised release on mandatory parole that is equal to not more than one-third of the total term of imprisonment; the amount of time that the inmate actually serves in imprisonment and on supervised release is subject to the provisions of AS 33.20.010§33.20.060.

(h) In addition to penalties authorized by this section, the court shall order a person convicted of an offense requiring the state to collect a blood sample, oral sample, or both, for the deoxyribonucleic acid identification registration system under AS 44.41.035 to submit to the collection of

(1) the sample or samples when requested by a health care professional acting on behalf of the state to provide the sample or samples; or

(2) an oral sample when requested by a juvenile or adult correctional, probation, or parole officer, or a peace officer.

(i) In addition to penalties authorized by this section, the court may order a defendant convicted of a violation of AS 11.41.410 or 11.41.434 where the victim of the offense was under 13 years of age to be subject to electronic monitoring up to the maximum length of probation on the person's release from a correctional facility.

(j) Nothing in (a)(13) of this section limits or restricts the authority of a court to order a person to refrain from the consumption of alcohol as a condition of sentence or probation.

(k) In making a determination under (a)(12) of this section for a defendant convicted of a crime involving a sex offense as defined in AS 12.63.100 or a crime involving domestic violence as defined in AS 18.66.990, there is a presumption that, unless the court finds on the record that contact between a defendant and the victim of the offense is necessary, the court shall order the defendant to have no contact, either directly or indirectly, with the victim until the defendant is unconditionally discharged.

(l) In this section "deadly weapon" has the meaning given in AS 11.81.900.

###### Sec. 12.55.020.   Enforcing judgment to pay money. [Repealed,§21 ch 166 SLA 1978.  For present provisions, see AS 12.55.025(f), AS 12.55.035(a), (d) and AS 12.55.051.]

###### Sec. 12.55.022.   Victim impact statement.

As part of the presentence report prepared on each felony offender, the probation officer shall prepare a victim impact statement reporting the following information:

(1) the financial, emotional, and medical effects of the offense on the victim;

(2) the need of the victim for restitution; and

(3) any other information required by the court.

###### Sec. 12.55.023.   Participation by victim in sentencing.

(a) If a victim requests, the prosecuting attorney shall provide the victim, before the sentencing hearing, with a copy of the following portions of the presentence report:

(1) the summary of the offense prepared by the Department of Corrections;

(2) the defendant's version of the offense;

(3) all statements and summaries of statements of the victim;

(4) the sentence recommendation of the Department of Corrections; and

(5) letters of support submitted to the court for consideration.

(b) A victim may submit to the sentencing court a written statement that the victim believes is relevant to the sentencing decision and may give sworn testimony or make an unsworn oral presentation to the court at the sentencing hearing. If there are numerous victims, the court may reasonably limit the number of victims who may give sworn testimony or make an unsworn oral presentation during the hearing. When requested by the victim of a felony or a class A misdemeanor, if the class A misdemeanor is a crime involving domestic violence or a crime against a person under AS 11.41, when the victim does not submit a statement, give testimony, or make an oral presentation, the victims' advocate may submit a written statement or make an unsworn oral presentation at the sentencing hearing on behalf of the victim.

###### Sec. 12.55.025.   Sentencing procedures.

(a) When imposing a sentence for conviction of a felony offense or a sentence of imprisonment exceeding 90 days or upon a conviction of a violation of AS 04, a regulation adopted under AS 04, or an ordinance adopted in conformity with AS 04.21.010, the court shall prepare, as a part of the record, a sentencing report that includes the following:

(1) a verbatim record of the sentencing hearing and any other in-court sentencing procedures;

(2) findings on material issues of fact and on factual questions required to be determined as a prerequisite to the selection of the sentence imposed;

(3) a clear statement of the terms of the sentence imposed; if a term of imprisonment is imposed, the statement must include

(A) the approximate minimum term the defendant is expected to serve before being released or placed on mandatory parole if the defendant is eligible for and does not forfeit good conduct deductions under AS 33.20.010; and

(B) if applicable, the approximate minimum term of imprisonment the defendant must serve before becoming eligible for release on discretionary parole;

(4) any recommendations as to the place of confinement or the manner of treatment; and

(5) in the case of a conviction for a felony offense, information assessing

(A) the financial, emotional, and medical effects of the offense on the victim;

(B) the need of the victim for restitution; and

(C) any other information required by the court.

(b) The sentencing report required under (a) of this section shall be furnished within 30 days after imposition of sentence to the Department of Law, the defendant, the Department of Corrections, the state Board of Parole if the defendant will be eligible for parole, and to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board if the defendant is to be sentenced for a conviction of a violation of AS 04, a regulation adopted under AS 04, or an ordinance adopted under AS 04.21.010.

(c) Except as provided in (d) of this section, when a defendant is sentenced to imprisonment, the term of confinement commences on the date of imposition of sentence unless the court specifically provides that the defendant must report to serve the sentence on another date. If the court provides another date to begin the term of confinement, the court shall provide the defendant with written notice of the date, time, and location of the correctional facility to which the defendant must report. A defendant shall receive credit for time spent in custody pending trial, sentencing, or appeal, if the detention was in connection with the offense for which the sentence was imposed. A defendant may not receive credit for more than the actual time spent in custody pending trial, sentencing, or appeal. The time during which a defendant is voluntarily absent from official detention after the defendant has been sentenced may not be credited toward service of the sentence.

(d) A sentence of imprisonment shall be stayed if an appeal is taken and the defendant is admitted to bail. If an appeal is taken and the defendant is not admitted to bail, the Department of Corrections shall designate the facility in which the defendant shall be detained pending appeal or admission to bail.

(e) [Repealed,§7 ch 125 SLA 2004.]

(f) A sentence that the defendant pay money, either as a fine or in restitution or both, constitutes a lien in the same manner as a judgment for money entered in a civil action. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the court to otherwise enforce payment of a fine or restitution.

(g) [Repealed,§7 ch 125 SLA 2004.]

(h) [Repealed,§7 ch 125 SLA 2004.]

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof applies to sentencing proceedings.

(j) The approximate minimum terms provided under (a)(3) of this section in the sentencing report are for information purposes only. The approximate minimum terms are not part of the sentence imposed and do not form a basis for review or appeal of the sentence imposed or provide a defendant with a right to any specific term of imprisonment or supervised release on mandatory parole.

(k) If a defendant intends to claim credit under AS 12.55.027 toward a sentence of imprisonment for time spent in a treatment program as a condition of bail in connection with an offense for which the defendant is being sentenced, the defendant shall file notice with the court and the prosecutor 10 days before the sentencing hearing. The notice shall include the number of days the defendant is claiming. The defendant must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the requirements of AS 12.55.027 are met before credit may be awarded. Except as provided in (l) of this section, except for good cause, a court may not consider a request for credit made under this subsection more than 90 days after the sentencing hearing.

(l) If a defendant intends to claim credit under AS 12.55.027 toward a sentence of imprisonment for time spent in a treatment program as a condition of bail while pending appeal, the defendant shall file notice with the court and the prosecutor not later than 90 days after return of the case to the trial court following appeal. The notice shall include the number of days the defendant is claiming. The defendant must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the requirements of AS 12.55.027 are met before credit may be awarded. Except for good cause, the court may not consider a request for credit made under this subsection after the deadline.

(m) When imposing a sentence for conviction of a felony offense or a sentence of imprisonment exceeding 90 days or, upon a conviction of a violation of AS 04, a regulation adopted under AS 04, or an ordinance adopted in conformity with AS 04.21.010, the court shall orally state on the record the terms of the sentence of imprisonment imposed and the approximate minimum sentence that must be served before the defendant may be eligible for mandatory parole and that the period of active incarceration may be reduced under other provisions of law.

###### Sec. 12.55.027.   Credit for time spent toward service of a sentence of imprisonment.

(a) A court may grant a defendant credit toward a sentence of imprisonment for time spent in a treatment program that furthers the reformation and rehabilitation of the defendant if the court finds that the program places a substantial restriction on the defendant's freedom of movement and behavior and is consistent with this section.

(b) A court may only grant credit under this section

(1) in the amount of one day of credit toward a sentence of imprisonment for each full day the defendant spent in a treatment program; and

(2) if the court ordered the defendant to participate in and comply with the conditions of the treatment program before the defendant entered the program.

(c) In granting credit toward a sentence of imprisonment for time spent in a treatment program, a court shall consider the following factors:

(1) the restrictions on the defendant's freedom of movement and behavior;

(2)  the circumstances under which the defendant was enrolled in the program;

(3) the residency requirements of the program;

(4) the physical custody and supervision of the defendant at the program;

(5) the circumstances under which the defendant is permitted to leave the program's facility;

(6) the rules of the program and the requirement that the defendant obey the orders of persons who have immediate custody or control over the defendant;

(7) the sanctions on the defendant for violating the program's rules or orders;

(8) whether the defendant is subject to arrest for leaving the program's facility without permission;

(9) the use of an electronic monitoring device;

(10) whether the program provides substance abuse treatment;

(11) the use of other technology that monitors or restricts the defendant's movement and behavior;

(12) other factors that support the court's finding that the program places a substantial restriction on the defendant's freedom of movement and behavior;

(13) other factors that support the court's finding that the program furthers the reformation and rehabilitation of the defendant.

(d) A court may grant credit against a sentence of imprisonment for time spent under electronic monitoring if the person has not committed a criminal offense while under electronic monitoring and the court imposes restrictions on the person's freedom of movement and behavior while under the electronic monitoring program, including requiring the person to be confined to a residence except for a

(1) court appearance;

(2) meeting with counsel; or

(3) period during which the person is at a location ordered by the court for the purposes of employment, attending educational or vocational training, performing community volunteer work, or attending a rehabilitative activity or medical appointment.

(e) If a defendant intends to claim credit toward a sentence of imprisonment for time spent in a treatment program or under electronic monitoring either as a condition of probation or as a condition of bail release after a petition to revoke probation has been filed, the defendant shall file notice with the court and the prosecutor 10 days before the disposition hearing. The notice shall include the amount of time the defendant is claiming. The defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the credit claimed meets the requirements of this section. A court may not consider, except for good cause, a request for credit made under this subsection more than 90 days after the disposition hearing.

(f) To qualify as a treatment program under this section, a program must

(1) be intended to address criminogenic traits or behaviors;

(3) require notification to the prosecuting authority, pretrial services officer, or probation officer if the person is discharged from the program for noncompliance.

(g) Unless the defendant participated in a residential treatment program under (c) and (f) of this section while under electronic monitoring, a court may not grant credit against a sentence of imprisonment under (d) of this section if the sentence is for

(1) a felony crime against a person under AS 11.41;

(2) a crime involving domestic violence as defined in AS 18.66.990;

(3) an offense under AS 11.71 involving the delivery of a controlled substance to a person under 19 years of age;

(4) burglary in the first degree under AS 11.46.300; or

(5) arson in the first degree under AS 11.46.400.

(h) Nothing in this section authorizes the release of a person on electronic monitoring after conviction and while awaiting sentencing if the person is ineligible for release under AS 12.30.040(b).

(i) A court may not grant credit under this section for time spent in a treatment program or under electronic monitoring for a sex offense as defined in AS 12.63.100.

(j) A court may grant credit under this section for time spent in a treatment program or under electronic monitoring if the court finds that the sentence, including credit toward the sentence of imprisonment, meets the requirements of AS 12.55.005.

(k) When a court grants credit toward a sentence of imprisonment under this section, if a defendant spends time in a treatment program while under electronic monitoring, the court may grant credit for either the time spent in the treatment program or for the time spent under electronic monitoring, but not for both.

(l) A court granting credit against a sentence of imprisonment under (a) of this section may grant credit of not more than 365 days against the total term of imprisonment imposed.

###### Sec. 12.55.039.   Surcharge.

(a) In addition to any fine or other penalty prescribed by law, a defendant who pleads guilty or nolo contendere to, forfeits bail for, or is convicted of a

(1) felony shall be assessed a surcharge of $200;

(2) violation of a misdemeanor offense under AS 28.33.030, 28.33.031, AS 28.35.030, or 28.35.032, or a violation of a municipal ordinance comparable to a misdemeanor offense under AS 28.33.030, 28.33.031, AS 28.35.030, or 28.35.032 and adopted under AS 28.01.010, shall be assessed a surcharge of $150;

(4) misdemeanor for which a sentence of incarceration may not be imposed, a violation or an infraction under state law, or a violation of a municipal ordinance imposing a penalty authorized by AS 29.25.070(a) if a sentence of incarceration may not be imposed for the ordinance violation, shall be assessed a surcharge of $20 if the fine or bail forfeiture amount for the offense is $30 or more.

(b) A court may not fail to impose the surcharge required under this section. The surcharge may not be waived, deferred, or suspended. A court may allow a defendant who is unable to pay the surcharge required to be imposed under this section to perform community work under AS 12.55.055(c) in lieu of the surcharge.

(c) The surcharge shall be paid within 10 days of imposition or such shorter period of time as ordered by the court. Failure to pay the surcharge is punishable as contempt of court. Proceedings to collect the surcharge may be instituted by the state, the municipality, or by the court on its own motion.

(d) Money collected under this section shall be deposited into the general fund and accounted for under AS 37.05.142.

###### Sec. 12.55.041.   Correctional facility surcharge.

(a) In addition to any fine or other penalty prescribed by law, a defendant who pleads guilty or nolo contendere to, or is convicted of, a crime under state law shall pay a correctional facility surcharge if, in connection with the crime, the defendant

(1) was arrested and taken to a correctional facility, regardless of whether the defendant was released or admitted to the facility; or

(2) is sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment.

(b) The court shall impose a single surcharge under (a) of this section on a defendant being sentenced for one or more crimes in a single judgment. The surcharge is

(1) $100 if the judgment includes a sentence for a felony;

(2) $50 if the judgment does not include a sentence for a felony.

(c) If the court places the defendant on probation, the court shall order that the defendant pay an additional correctional facility surcharge of $100. The additional surcharge shall be suspended but later imposed if the defendant's probation is revoked and, in connection with the probation revocation, the defendant

(1) was arrested and taken to a correctional facility, regardless of whether the defendant was released or admitted to the facility; or

(2) is ordered to serve a term of imprisonment for the probation revocation.

(d) The court shall include a surcharge imposed under (a) of this section in the judgment of conviction. The court shall include the imposition of a surcharge under (c) of this section in the order revoking probation. For a surcharge that is not paid by the person as required by this section, the state shall seek reimbursement from the person's permanent fund dividend as provided under AS 43.23.140. For purposes of collection and priority of attachment under AS 43.23.140, a surcharge imposed under this section is accounted for in the same manner as a cost of imprisonment under AS 28.35.030(k) and 28.35.032(o). The state may enforce payment of a surcharge under this section under AS 09.35 as if it were a civil judgment enforceable by execution. This subsection does not limit the authority of the court to enforce surcharges.

(e) In this section, "correctional facility" has the meaning given in AS 33.30.901.

###### Sec. 12.55.045.   Restitution and compensation.

(a) The court shall, when presented with credible evidence, unless the victim or other person expressly declines restitution, order a defendant convicted of an offense to make restitution as provided in this section, including restitution to the victim or other person injured by the offense, to a public, private, or private nonprofit organization that has provided or is or will be providing counseling, medical, or shelter services to the victim or other person injured by the offense, or as otherwise authorized by law. The court shall, when presented with credible evidence, unless the victim expressly declines restitution, also order a defendant convicted of an offense to compensate a victim that is a nonprofit organization for the value of labor or goods provided by volunteers if the labor or goods were necessary to alleviate or mitigate the effects of the defendant's crime. In determining the amount and method of payment of restitution or compensation, the court shall take into account the

(1) public policy that favors requiring criminals to compensate for damages and injury, including loss of income, to their victims; and

(2) financial burden placed on the victim and those who provide services to the victim and other persons injured by the offense as a result of the criminal conduct of the defendant.

(b) An order of restitution under this section does not limit any civil liability of the defendant arising from the defendant's conduct.

(c) If a defendant is sentenced to pay restitution, the court may grant permission for the payment to be made within a specified period of time or in specified installments. If the defendant fails to make one or more payments required under this section, the victim or the state on the victim's behalf may enforce the total amount remaining under the order of restitution as provided in (l) of this section.

(d) In any case, including a case in which the defendant is convicted of a violation of AS 11.46.120§11.46.150 and the property is commercial fishing gear as defined in AS 16.43.990, the court shall consider the victim's loss, and the order of restitution may include compensation for loss of income.

(e)  [Repealed,§7 ch 17 SLA 2004.]

(f)  [Repealed,§7 ch 17 SLA 2004.]

(g) The court may not, in ordering the amount of restitution, consider the defendant's ability to pay restitution.

(h) In imposing restitution under this section, the court may require the defendant to make restitution by means other than the payment of money.

(i) An order of restitution made under this section is a condition of the defendant's sentence and, in cases in which the court suspends all or a portion of the defendant's sentence, the order of restitution is a condition of the suspended sentence. If the court suspends imposition of sentence under AS 12.55.085, the order of restitution is a condition of the suspended imposition of sentence.

(j) A defendant who is convicted of an offense for which restitution may be ordered shall submit financial information as ordered by the court. The Alaska Court System shall prepare a form, in consultation with the Department of Law, for the submission of the information; the form must include a warning that submission of incomplete or inaccurate information is punishable as unsworn falsification in the second degree under AS 11.56.210. A defendant who is convicted of (1) a felony shall submit the form to the probation office within 30 days after conviction, and the probation officer shall attach the form to the presentence report, or (2) a misdemeanor shall file the form with the defendant's response or opposition to the restitution amount. The defendant shall provide a copy of the completed form to the prosecuting authority.

(k) The court, on its own motion or at the request of the prosecuting authority or probation officer, may order a defendant on probation who has been ordered to pay restitution to submit financial information to the court using the form specified in (j) of this section. The defendant shall file the completed form with the court within five days after the court's order. The defendant shall provide a copy of the completed form to the prosecuting authority and the person's probation officer, if any.

(l) An order by the court that the defendant pay restitution is a civil judgment for the amount of the restitution. An order by the court that the defendant pay restitution when the court suspends entry of judgment under AS 12.55.078 or suspends imposition of sentence under AS 12.55.085 is a civil judgment for the amount of the restitution and remains enforceable and is not discharged when the proceeding is dismissed under AS 12.55.078 or a conviction is set aside under AS 12.55.085. The victim or the state on behalf of the victim may enforce the judgment through any procedure authorized by law for the enforcement of a civil judgment. If the victim enforces or collects restitution through civil process, collection costs and full reasonable attorney fees shall be awarded. If the state on the victim's behalf enforces or collects restitution through civil process, collection costs and full reasonable attorney fees shall be awarded, up to a maximum of twice the amount of restitution owing at the time the civil process was initiated. This section does not limit the authority of the court to enforce orders of restitution.

(m) Notwithstanding another provision of law, the court shall accept

(1) payments of restitution from a defendant at any time; and

(2) prepayments of restitution or payments in anticipation of an order of restitution.

(n) In determining the amount of actual damages or loss for restitution under this section, the court shall value property as the market value of the property at the time and place of the crime or, if the market value cannot reasonably be ascertained, the cost of replacement of the property within a reasonable time after the crime.

(o) In this section,

(1) "conviction" means that the defendant has entered a plea of guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere, or has been found guilty or guilty but mentally ill by a court or jury;

(2) "loss of income" includes the total loss of income a business or person suffers as a result of not having stolen property available during the time it takes to obtain a replacement.

###### Sec. 12.55.050.   Increased punishment for persons convicted of more than one felony. [Repealed,§21 ch 166 SLA 1978. For sentences of imprisonment for felonies, see AS 12.55.125.]

###### Sec. 12.55.051.   Enforcement of fines and restitution.

(a) If the defendant defaults in the payment of a fine or any installment or of restitution or any installment, the court may order the defendant to show cause why the defendant should not be sentenced to imprisonment for nonpayment and, if the payment was made a condition of the defendant's probation, may revoke the probation of the defendant. In a contempt or probation revocation proceeding brought as a result of failure to pay a fine or restitution, it is an affirmative defense that the defendant was unable to pay despite having made continuing good faith efforts to pay the fine or restitution. If the court finds that the defendant was unable to pay despite having made continuing good faith efforts, the defendant may not be imprisoned solely because of the inability to pay. If the court does not find that the default was attributable to the defendant's inability to pay despite having made continuing good faith efforts to pay the fine or restitution, the court may order the defendant imprisoned until the order of the court is satisfied. A term of imprisonment imposed under this section may not exceed one day for each $50 of the unpaid portion of the fine or restitution or one year, whichever is shorter. Credit shall be given toward satisfaction of the order of the court for every day a person is incarcerated for nonpayment of a fine or restitution.

(b) When a fine or restitution is imposed on an organization, the person authorized to make disbursements from the assets of the organization shall pay the fine or restitution from those assets.  A person required to pay a fine or restitution under this subsection who intentionally refuses or fails to make a good faith effort to pay is punishable under (a) of this section.

(c) A defendant who has been sentenced to pay a fine or restitution may request a hearing regarding the defendant's ability to pay the fine or restitution at any time that the defendant is required to pay all or a portion of the fine or restitution. The court may deny the request if it has previously considered the defendant's ability to pay and the defendant's request does not allege changed circumstances. If, at a hearing under this subsection, the defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant will be unable through good faith efforts to satisfy the order requiring payment of the fine or restitution, the court shall modify the order so that the defendant can pay the fine or restitution through good faith efforts. The court may reduce the fine ordered, change the payment schedule, or otherwise modify the order. The court may not reduce an order of restitution but may change the payment schedule.

(d) The state may enforce payment of a fine against a defendant under AS 09.35 as if the order were a civil judgment enforceable by execution. This subsection does not limit the authority of the court to enforce fines.

(e) The Department of Law is authorized to collect restitution on behalf of the recipient unless

(1) the recipient elects as provided in (f) of this section to enforce the order of restitution without the assistance of the Department of Law; or

(2) the order requires restitution to be made in a form other than payment of a specific dollar amount.

(f) The court shall forward a copy of an order of restitution to the Department of Law and the office of victims' rights when the judgment is entered. Along with the copy of the order, the court shall provide the name, date of birth, social security number, and current address of the recipient of the restitution and the defendant, to the extent that the court has that information in its possession. Upon receipt of the order and other information from the court, the Department of Law shall send a notice to the recipient regarding the recipient's rights under this section, including the right to elect to enforce the order of restitution without the assistance of the Department of Law and of the possibility of, and procedure for, receiving payment from the restorative justice account. The information provided to the Department of Law and the office of victims' rights under this subsection is confidential and is not open to inspection as a public record under AS 40.25.110. The Department of Law, the office of victims' rights, or agents for the Department of Law or office of victims' rights may not disclose the information except as necessary to collect on the restitution.

(g) The Department of Law may not begin collection procedures on the order of restitution until the recipient has been given notice and has been given 90days after receipt of notice to elect to collect the restitution without the assistance of the Department of Law. If the Department of Law receives a response to the notice before the 90-day period, the Department of Law may begin collection on the restitution. A recipient may inform the Department of Law at a later time of the recipient's election to collect the restitution without the assistance of the Department of Law; upon receipt of that information, the Department of Law may no longer proceed with collection efforts on behalf of the recipient. A recipient who has elected under this section to collect restitution without the assistance of the Department of Law may not later request the services of that department to collect the restitution.

(h) If the Department of Law or its agents proceed to collect restitution on behalf of a recipient under (g) of this section, the actions of the Department of Law or an agent of the Department of Law on behalf of the recipient do not create an attorney-client relationship between the Department of Law and the recipient. The Department of Law or its agents may not settle a judgment for restitution without the consent of the recipient of the restitution.

(i) An action for damages may not be brought against the state or any of its agents, officers, or employees based on an action or omission under this section.

(j) The Department of Law may enter into contracts on behalf of the state to carry out the collection procedures of this section. The Department of Law may adopt regulations necessary to carry out the collection procedures of this section, including the reimbursement of attorney fees and costs in appropriate cases.

###### Sec. 12.55.055.   Community work.

(a) The court may order a defendant convicted of an offense to perform community work as a condition of probation, a suspended sentence, suspended imposition of sentence, or suspended entry of judgment, or in addition to any fine or restitution ordered. If the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment, the court may recommend to the Department of Corrections that the defendant perform community work.

(b) Community work includes work on projects designed to reduce or eliminate environmental damage, protect the public health, or improve public lands, forests, parks, roads, highways, facilities, or education.  Community work may not confer a private benefit on a person except as may be incidental to the public benefit.

(c) The court may offer a defendant convicted of an offense the option of performing community work in lieu of a fine, surcharge, or portion of a fine or surcharge if the court finds the defendant is unable to pay the fine. The value of community work in lieu of a fine is the state's minimum wage for each hour.

(d) The court may offer a defendant convicted of an offense the option of performing community work in lieu of a sentence of imprisonment. Substitution of community work shall be at a rate of eight hours for each day of imprisonment. A court may not offer substitution of community work for any mandatory minimum period of imprisonment or for any period within the presumptive range of imprisonment for the offense.

(e) Medical benefits for an individual injured while performing community work at the direction of the state shall be assumed by the state to the extent not covered by collateral sources. When the state pays medical benefits under this subsection, a claim for medical expenses by the injured individual against a third party is subrogated to the state.

(f)  [Repealed,§11 ch 71 SLA 1996.]

(g) The court may not

(1) offer a defendant convicted of an offense the option of serving jail time in lieu of performing uncompleted community work previously ordered by the court; or

(2) convert uncompleted community work hours into a sentence of imprisonment.

(h) If a court orders community work as part of the defendant's sentence under this section, the court shall provide notice to the defendant at sentencing and include as a provision of the judgment that if the defendant fails to provide proof of community work within 20 days after the date set by the court, the court shall convert those community work hours to a fine equal to the number of uncompleted work hours multiplied by the state's minimum hourly wage and issue a judgment against the defendant for that amount.

###### Sec. 12.55.078.   Suspending entry of judgment.

(a) Except as provided in (f) of this section, if a person is found guilty or pleads guilty to a crime, the court may, with the consent of the defendant and the prosecution and without imposing or entering a judgment of guilt, defer further proceedings and place the person on probation. The period of probation may not exceed the applicable terms set out in AS 12.55.090(c). The court may not impose a sentence of imprisonment under this subsection.

(b) The court shall impose conditions of probation for a person on probation as provided in (a) of this section, which may include that the person

(1) abide by all local, state, and federal laws;

(2) not leave the state without prior consent of the court;

(3) pay restitution as ordered by the court; and

(4) obey any other conditions of probation set by the court.

(c) At any time during the probationary term of the person released on probation, a probation officer may, without warrant or other process, rearrest the person so placed in the officer's care and bring the person before the court, or the court may, in its discretion, issue a warrant for the rearrest of the person. The court may revoke and terminate the probation if the court finds that the person placed on probation is

(1) violating the conditions of probation;

(2) engaging in criminal practices; or

(3) violating an order of the court to participate in or comply with the treatment plan of a rehabilitation program under AS 12.55.015(a)(10).

(d) If the court finds that the person has successfully completed probation, the court shall, at the end of the probationary period set by the court, or at any time after the expiration of one year from the date the original probation was imposed, discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person. A person who is discharged under this subsection is not convicted of a crime.

(e) If the court finds that the person has violated the conditions of probation ordered by the court, the court may revoke and terminate the person's probation, enter judgment on the person's previous plea or finding of guilt, and pronounce sentence at any time within the maximum probation period authorized by this section.

(f) The court may not suspend the imposition or entry of judgment and may not defer prosecution under this section of a person who

(1) is charged with a violation of AS 11.41.100§11.41.220, 11.41.260§11.41.320, 11.41.360§11.41.370, 11.41.410§11.41.530, AS 11.46.400, AS 11.61.125§11.61.128, or AS 11.66.110§11.66.135;

(2) uses a firearm in the commission of the offense for which the person is charged;

(3) has previously been granted a suspension of judgment under this section or a similar statute in another jurisdiction, unless the court enters written findings that by clear and convincing evidence the person's prospects for rehabilitation are high and suspending judgment under this section adequately protects the victim of the offense, if any, and the community;

(4) is charged with a violation of AS 11.41.230, 11.41.250, or a felony and the person has one or more prior convictions for a misdemeanor violation of AS 11.41 or for a felony or for a violation of a law in this or another jurisdiction having similar elements to an offense defined as a misdemeanor in AS 11.41 or as a felony in this state; for the purposes of this paragraph, a person shall be considered to have a prior conviction even if

(A) the charges were dismissed under this section;

(B) the conviction has been set aside under AS 12.55.085; or

(C) the charge or conviction was dismissed or set aside under an equivalent provision of the laws of another jurisdiction; or

(5) is charged with a crime involving domestic violence, as defined in AS 18.66.990.

###### Sec. 12.55.080.   Suspension of sentence and probation.

Upon entering a judgment of conviction of a crime, or at any time within 60 days from the date of entry of that judgment of conviction, a court, when satisfied that the ends of justice and the best interest of the public as well as the defendant will be served thereby, may suspend the imposition or execution or balance of the sentence or a portion thereof, and place the defendant on probation for a period and upon the terms and conditions as the court considers best.

###### Sec. 12.55.085.   Suspending imposition of sentence.

(a) Except as provided in (f) of this section, if it appears that there are circumstances in mitigation of the punishment, or that the ends of justice will be served, the court may, in its discretion, suspend the imposition of sentence and may direct that the suspension continue for a period of time, not exceeding the maximum term of sentence that may be imposed or a period of one year, whichever is greater, and upon the terms and conditions that the court determines, and shall place the person on probation, under the charge and supervision of the probation officer of the court during the suspension.

(b) At any time during the probationary term of the person released on probation, a probation officer may, without warrant or other process, rearrest the person so placed in the officer's care and bring the person before the court, or the court may, in its discretion, issue a warrant for the rearrest of the person.  The court may revoke and terminate the probation if the interests of justice require, and if the court, in its judgment, has reason to believe that the person placed upon probation is

(1) violating the conditions of probation;

(2) engaging in criminal practices; or

(3) violating an order of the court to participate in or comply with the treatment plan of a rehabilitation program under  AS 12.55.015(a)(10).

(c) Upon the revocation and termination of the probation, the court may pronounce sentence at any time within the maximum probation period authorized by this section, subject to the limitation specified in  AS 12.55.086(c).

(d) The court may at any time during the period of probation revoke or modify its order of suspension of imposition of sentence.  It may at any time, when the ends of justice will be served, and when the good conduct and reform of the person held on probation warrant it, terminate the period of probation and discharge the person held.  If the court has not revoked the order of probation and pronounced sentence, the defendant shall, at the end of the term of probation, be discharged by the court.

(e) Upon the discharge by the court without imposition of sentence, the court may set aside the conviction and issue to the person a certificate to that effect.

(f) The court may not suspend the imposition of sentence of a person who

(1) is convicted of a violation of  AS 11.41.100§ 11.41.220,  11.41.260§ 11.41.320,  11.41.360§ 11.41.370,  11.41.410§ 11.41.530,  AS 11.46.400,  AS 11.61.125§ 11.61.128, or  AS 11.66.110§ 11.66.135;

(2) uses a firearm in the commission of the offense for which the person is convicted; or

(3) is convicted of a violation of  AS 11.41.230§ 11.41.250 or a felony and the person has one or more prior convictions for a misdemeanor violation of  AS 11.41 or for a felony or for a violation of a law in this or another jurisdiction having similar elements to an offense defined as a misdemeanor in  AS 11.41 or as a felony in this state; for the purposes of this paragraph, a person shall be considered to have a prior conviction even if that conviction has been set aside under (e) of this section or under the equivalent provision of the laws of another jurisdiction.

###### Sec. 12.55.086.   Imprisonment as a condition of suspended imposition of sentence.

(a) When the imposition of sentence is suspended under AS 12.55.085, the court may require, as a special condition of probation, that the defendant serve a definite term of continuous or periodic imprisonment, not to exceed the maximum term of imprisonment that could have been imposed. The court may recommend that the defendant serve all or part of the term in a correctional restitution center.

(a) A sentence of imprisonment lawfully imposed by the superior court for a term or for aggregate terms exceeding two years of unsuspended incarceration for a felony offense or exceeding 120 days for a misdemeanor offense may be appealed to the court of appeals by the defendant on the ground that the sentence is excessive, unless the sentence was imposed in accordance with a plea agreement under the applicable Alaska Rules of Criminal Procedure and that agreement provided for imposition of a specific sentence or a sentence equal to or less than a specified maximum sentence. If the superior court imposed a sentence in accordance with a plea agreement that provided for a minimum sentence, the defendant may appeal only that portion of the sentence that exceeds the minimum sentence provided for in the plea agreement and that exceeds two years of unsuspended incarceration for a felony offense or 120 days of unsuspended incarceration for a misdemeanor offense. By appealing a sentence under this section, the defendant waives the right to plead that by a revision of the sentence resulting from the appeal the defendant has been twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense.

(b) A sentence of imprisonment lawfully imposed by the superior court may be appealed to the court of appeals by the state on the ground that the sentence is too lenient; however, when a sentence is appealed by the state and the defendant has not appealed the sentence, the court is not authorized to increase the sentence but may express its approval or disapproval of the sentence and its reasons in a written opinion.

(c) A sentence appeal under this section does not confer or enlarge the right to bail pending appeal. When the defendant, in the prosecution of a regular appeal, urges excessiveness of the sentence as an additional ground for appeal, the defendant's right to bail pending appeal is governed by the relevant statutes and the rules of the court.

(d) A sentence of imprisonment lawfully imposed by the district court for a term or for aggregate terms exceeding 120 days of unsuspended incarceration may be appealed to the superior court by the defendant on the ground that the sentence is excessive, unless the sentence was imposed in accordance with a plea agreement under the applicable Alaska Rules of Criminal Procedure and that agreement provided for imposition of a specific sentence or a sentence equal to or less than a specified maximum sentence. If the district court imposed a sentence in accordance with a plea agreement that provided for a minimum sentence, the defendant may appeal only that portion of the sentence that exceeds the minimum sentence provided for in the plea agreement and that exceeds 120 days of unsuspended incarceration. By appealing a sentence under this section, the defendant waives the right to plead that by a revision of the sentence resulting from the appeal the defendant has been twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense. A sentence of imprisonment lawfully imposed by the district court may be appealed to the superior court by the state on the ground that the sentence is too lenient; however, when a sentence is appealed by the state, the court may not increase the sentence but may express its approval or disapproval of the sentence and its reasons in a written opinion.

(e) A sentence within an applicable presumptive range set out in AS 12.55.125 or a consecutive or partially consecutive sentence imposed in accordance with the minimum sentences set out in AS 12.55.127 may not be appealed to the court of appeals under this section or AS 22.07.020 on the ground that the sentence is excessive. However, the sentence may be reviewed by an appellate court on the ground that it is excessive through a petition filed under rules adopted by the supreme court.

(f) The victim of the crime for which a defendant has been convicted and sentenced may file a petition for review in an appellate court of a sentence that is below the sentencing range for the crime.

(2) a history free of unprosecuted, undocumented, or undetected sexual offenses.

(d) A court may not refer a case to a three-judge panel under (a) of this section if the request for referral is based, in whole or in part, on the claim that a sentence within the presumptive range may result in the classification of the defendant as deportable under federal immigration law.

(e) If the three-judge panel determines under (b) of this section that manifest injustice would result from imposition of a sentence within the presumptive range and the panel also finds that the defendant has an exceptional potential for rehabilitation and that a sentence of less than the presumptive range should be imposed because of the defendant's exceptional potential for rehabilitation, the panel

The system must also allow crime victims to initiate telephone calls to the system to receive the latest status report for their offender. An automated victim notification system established under this section satisfies the duty of a state agency to notify a crime victim of the change in status of an offender. The failure of a system to provide notice to a crime victim does not give rise to a separate cause of action by the crime victim against the state, an agency of the state, or a municipality, or the officers, employees, or contractors of the state, agency of the state, or municipality.

(b) Each department and each municipality shall cooperate with the Department of Corrections in establishing and maintaining an automated victim notification system required under this section.

(a) The prosecution in a criminal case may not be required to furnish to the defendant personally the address or telephone number of a victim or witness absent a showing of good cause as determined by the court. Except as provided in (b) of this section, good cause exists when the defendant is proceeding without counsel. When a defendant is represented by counsel, the address and telephone number of a victim or witness may be disclosed to the defendant's counsel, but the court shall order the defendant's counsel to not disclose the information to the defendant.

(b) If the defendant is proceeding without counsel in a case involving a charged violation of AS 11.41, AS 11.46.300§11.46.330, AS 11.56.740, 11.56.807, 11.56.810, AS 11.61.190§11.61.210, or a crime involving domestic violence and the court finds that the defendant may pose a continuing threat to the victim of or witness to the offense charged, the court shall protect the address and telephone number of the victim or witness by providing the information only to a person specified by the court or by imposing other restrictions that the court considers necessary. When an address or telephone number is released to a person specified by the court under this subsection, that person, who shall be ordered not to disclose the information to the defendant, shall contact the victim or witness on behalf of the defendant, and the defendant shall meet or speak with the victim or witness only in the presence of that person.

(1) of the person's identity and specific association with the defendant;

(2) that the victim does not have to talk to the person unless the victim wishes; and

(3) that the victim may have a prosecuting attorney or other person present during an interview.

(d) If a defendant or a person acting on behalf of a defendant wishes to make a recording of statements of the victim of an offense with which the defendant is or could be charged in this or another jurisdiction, or of a witness, the person shall, before recording begins, obtain the consent of the victim or witness to record the statement by clearly informing the victim or witness (1) of the information set out in (c) of this section, (2) that the statement will be recorded if the victim or witness consents, and (3) that the victim or witness may obtain a transcript or other copy of the recorded statement upon request. When recording begins, the person making the recording shall indicate in the recording that the victim or witness has been informed as required by this subsection, and the victim or witness shall state in the recording that consent of the victim or witness to the recording has been given.

(1) notwithstanding AS 12.61.120, contact the victim of the offense or a witness to the offense if the victim or witness, or the parent or guardian of the victim or witness if the victim or witness is a minor, has informed the defendant or the defendant's counsel in writing or in person that the victim or witness does not wish to be contacted by the defense; a victim or witness who has not informed the defendant or the defendant's counsel in writing or in person that the victim does not wish to be contacted by the defense is entitled to rights as provided in AS 12.61.120;

(2) obtain a statement from the victim of the offense or a witness to the offense, unless,

(A) if the statement is taken as a recording, the recording is taken in compliance with AS 12.61.120, and written authorization is first obtained from the victim or witness, or from the parent or guardian of the victim or witness if the victim or witness is a minor; the written authorization must state that the victim or witness is aware that there is no legal requirement that the victim or witness talk to the defense; or

(B) if the statement is not taken as a recording, written authorization is first obtained from the victim or witness, or from the parent or guardian of the victim or witness if the victim or witness is a minor; the written authorization must state that the victim or witness is aware that there is no legal requirement that the victim or witness talk to the defense; a victim or witness making a statement under this subparagraph remains entitled to rights as provided in AS 12.61.120.

A statement obtained from a victim or witness in violation of AS 12.61.120 or 12.61.125 is presumed inadmissible in a prosecution of the defendant. To overcome the presumption of inadmissibility, the defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence that

(1) the statement is reliable;

(2) similar evidence is unavailable from any other source; and

(3) failure to introduce the statement would substantially undermine the reliability of the fact-finding process and result in manifest injustice.

###### Sec. 12.61.130.   Disclosure during court proceedings.

(a) During a trial or hearing related to a criminal prosecution, the residence and business addresses and telephone numbers of a victim of or witness to the charged offense may not be disclosed in open court, and a victim or witness may not be required to provide the addresses or telephone numbers in response to questioning, unless the court determines that the information is necessary and relevant to the facts of the case. The burden to establish the need and relevance for disclosure is on the party seeking disclosure. Before ordering disclosure, the court shall take appropriate measures to minimize the risk of personal harm to the victim or witness that would result from the disclosure.

(b) The address or telephone number of a victim of or witness to a charged offense may not be placed in the court file or court documents relating to that offense except when

Instead, the victim's initials shall be used. However, a sealed record containing the victim's name shall be kept by the court in order to ensure that a defendant is not charged twice for the same offense.

###### Sec. 12.61.150.   Public and media access.

AS 12.61.100§12.61.150 may not be construed to require the court to exclude the public from any stage of the criminal proceeding or to interfere with the right of news media to report information lawfully obtained.

## Chapter 72. Post-Conviction Relief Procedures for Persons Convicted of Criminal Offenses.

###### Sec. 12.72.010.   Scope of post-conviction relief.

A person who has been convicted of, or sentenced for, a crime may institute a proceeding for post-conviction relief if the person claims

(1) that the conviction or the sentence was in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the constitution or laws of this state;

(2) that the court was without jurisdiction to impose sentence;

(3) that a prior conviction has been set aside and the prior conviction was used as a statutorily required enhancement of the sentence imposed;

(4) that there exists evidence of material facts, not previously presented and heard by the court, that requires vacation of the conviction or sentence in the interest of justice; if the person seeks post-conviction DNA testing to support a claim under this paragraph, the person's exclusive method for obtaining that testing is an application under AS 12.73;

(5) that the person's sentence has expired, or the person's probation, parole, or conditional release has been unlawfully revoked, or the person is otherwise unlawfully held in custody or other restraint;

(6) that the conviction or sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack upon any ground or alleged error previously available under the common law, statutory law, or other writ, motion, petition, proceeding, or remedy;

(7) that

(A) there has been a significant change in law, whether substantive or procedural, applied in the process leading to the person's conviction or sentence;

(B) the change in the law was not reasonably foreseeable by a judge or a competent attorney;

(C) it is appropriate to retroactively apply the change in law because the change requires observance of procedures without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished; and

(D) the failure to retroactively apply the change in law would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice, which is established by demonstrating that, had the changed law been in effect at the time of the applicant's trial, a reasonable trier of fact would have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the applicant;

(8) that, after the imposition of sentence, the applicant seeks to withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere in order to correct manifest injustice under the Alaska Rules of Criminal Procedure; or

(9) that the applicant was not afforded effective assistance of counsel at trial or on direct appeal.

###### Sec. 12.72.020.   Limitations on applications for post-conviction relief.

(a) A claim may not be brought under AS 12.72.010 or the Alaska Rules of Criminal Procedure if

(1) the claim is based on the admission or exclusion of evidence at trial or on the ground that the sentence is excessive;

(2) the claim was, or could have been but was not, raised in a direct appeal from the proceeding that resulted in the conviction;

(3) the later of the following dates has passed, except that if the applicant claims that the sentence was illegal there is no time limit on the claim:

If the court orders additional testing by another laboratory at the request of the applicant, the laboratory operated or approved by the Department of Public Safety shall preserve a portion of the evidence for later testing. A laboratory selected by the applicant to perform testing under this section must comply with the quality assurance standards for DNA adopted by the United States Department of Justice and be accredited by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors Laboratory Accreditation Board or accepted as equivalent by the Department of Public Safety.

(d) Except as provided in (b) of this section, the results of testing ordered under this section shall be entered into the DNA identification registration system under AS 44.41.035 and into any other law enforcement database available to the Department of Public Safety.

###### Sec. 12.73.060.   Post-conviction testing by stipulation.

A person imprisoned or otherwise restrained of liberty under any pretense whatsoever, except in the cases specified in AS 12.75.020, may prosecute a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of the imprisonment or restraint, and, if illegal, to be released from custody or to be granted another remedy as law and justice require.  Procedure may be as prescribed in the Rules of Civil Procedure.

###### Sec. 12.75.020.   Persons not entitled to prosecute writ.

A person properly imprisoned or restrained by virtue of the legal judgment of a competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction, or by virtue of an execution regularly and lawfully issued upon that judgment or decree shall not be allowed to prosecute the writ.

###### Sec. 12.75.030.   Offense not bailable.

When it appears that the cause or offense for which the person prosecuting the writ is imprisoned or restrained is not bailable, the production of the party may be dispensed with and the writ issued accordingly.

###### Sec. 12.75.040.   Production of body.

The person on whom a writ is served shall bring the body of the person in custody or under restraint, according to the command of the writ, except in the cases provided in AS 12.75.050.

###### Sec. 12.75.050.   Hearing without production of person.

When, from the sickness or infirmity of the person directed to be produced, that person cannot without danger be brought before the court, the person in whose custody or power that person is may state that fact in the return to the writ.  If the court is satisfied of the truth of the return and the return is otherwise sufficient, the court shall proceed to decide on the return and to dispose of the matter as if the party had been produced.

###### Sec. 12.75.060.   Proceedings on disobedience of writ.

If the person upon whom the writ is served refuses or neglects to obey it within the time required, and no sufficient excuse is shown, it is the duty of the court before whom the writ is returnable, upon due proof of service, to immediately issue a warrant against that person, directed to a peace officer commanding the officer to immediately apprehend and bring the person before the court. Upon that person being brought before the court, the court shall commit that person to custody until the person makes return to the writ and complies with any order that may be made.

###### Sec. 12.75.070.   Precept to peace officer.

A court that issues a writ without requiring the production of the person or that issues a warrant may also, at any time before final decision, issue a precept to the peace officer to whom the writ or warrant is directed commanding the officer to immediately bring the person for whose benefit the writ was allowed before the court.  That person shall remain in the custody of the peace officer until discharged, remanded, or the matter is otherwise disposed of as law and justice require.

###### Sec. 12.75.080.   Discharge of party.

If no legal cause is shown for the imprisonment or restraint, or for its continuation, the court shall discharge the party from the custody or restraint under which the party is held or grant any other appropriate remedy.

###### Sec. 12.75.090.   Remand of party legally detained.

The court shall remand the party if it appears that the party is legally detained in custody.

###### Sec. 12.75.100.   Remedy of person in custody by virtue of civil process.

(1) when the jurisdiction of the court or officer has been exceeded, either as to matter, place, sum, or person;

(2) when, though the original imprisonment was lawful, yet by some act, omission, or event that has taken place afterwards, the party has become entitled to a discharge or other remedy;

(3) when the order or process is defective in some matter of substance required by law, rendering the process void;

(4) when the order or process, though in proper form, has been issued in a case not allowed by law;

(5) when the person having the custody of the prisoner under the order or process is not the person empowered by law to detain the prisoner; or

(6) when the order or process is not authorized by a judgment of a court or by a provision of law.

###### Sec. 12.75.110.   Limitation on scope of court's inquiry.

No court or judge, on the return of a writ of habeas corpus, may inquire into the legality or justice of any order, judgment, or process specified in AS 12.75.020 or into the justice, propriety, or legality of a commitment for a contempt made by a court, officer, or body, according to law, and charged in the commitment, as provided by law.

###### Sec. 12.75.120.   Proceedings where commitment irregular.

If it appears by the testimony offered with the return, or upon the hearing that the party is probably guilty of a criminal offense, the court, although the commitment is irregular, shall immediately remand the party to the custody of the proper person.

###### Sec. 12.75.130.   Custody of party pending judgment.

Until judgment is given upon the return, the party may either be committed to the custody of a peace officer or placed in the officer's care or under such custody as the party's age or circumstances require.

###### Sec. 12.75.140.   Admission to bail.

A person prosecuting a writ of habeas corpus may, at any time after the writ is allowed, be admitted to bail by the court allowing the writ, or by another judge or magistrate designated by that court or judge, pending the hearing upon the writ and the final order of the court and, in case of appeal, during the pendency of the appeal and until the final order of the appellate court.  The bail shall be by written undertaking and executed as bail upon arrest, and the undertaking shall be conditioned that the person so admitted to bail shall appear in the designated court or before the designated judge or magistrate whenever required, and shall at all times be amenable to the order or process of that court, judge, or magistrate, and that if the person fails to perform either of those conditions, the surety or sureties on the undertaking will pay to the state the sum in which that person is so admitted to bail.

###### Sec. 12.75.150.   Effect of admitting to bail.

The admitting to bail of a person prosecuting a writ of habeas corpus does not in any manner affect the writ or other proceedings or the full right of that person to have the cause and legality of the person's imprisonment inquired into and determined both in the trial court and upon appeal.

###### Sec. 12.75.160.   Enforcing judgment of discharge.

Obedience to a judgment for the discharge of a person imprisoned or restrained, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be enforced by the court by proceedings for a contempt.  A peace officer or other person is not liable to an action or proceeding for obeying the judgment of discharge.

###### Sec. 12.75.170.   Discharge as bar to subsequent restraint.

No person who has been discharged by the order of a court upon habeas corpus shall again be imprisoned, restrained, or kept in custody for the same cause except in the following cases:

(1) if the party has been discharged from a commitment on a criminal charge and is afterwards committed for the same offense by legal order or process;

(2) if, after a judgment or discharge for a defect of evidence, or for a material defect in the commitment, in a criminal case, the party is again arrested on sufficient evidence and committed by legal process for the same offense;

(3) if, after a civil action, the party has been discharged for any illegality in the judgment, decree, or process specified in AS 12.75.100, and is afterwards imprisoned for the same cause of action;

(4) if, in a civil action, the party has been discharged from commitment on an order of arrest, and is afterwards committed on execution, in the same action, or on order of arrest in another action, after the dismissal of the first action.

###### Sec. 12.75.180.   Grounds for warrant in lieu of writ.

When it appears to a court authorized to issue the writ of habeas corpus that a person is illegally imprisoned or restrained, and that there is good reason to believe that the person will be carried out of the state or suffer some irreparable injury before the person can be relieved by the issuing of a writ of habeas corpus, a court or judge authorized to issue the writ may issue a warrant reciting the facts, and directed to a peace officer commanding the officer to immediately bring the person before the court to be dealt with according to law.

###### Sec. 12.75.190.   Warrant may include command for arrest of defendant.

When the proof mentioned in AS 12.75.180 is also sufficient to justify the arrest of the person having the party in custody, as for a criminal offense, committed in the taking or detaining of the party, the warrant may also contain an order for the arrest of the person for that offense.

###### Sec. 12.75.200.   Warrant in lieu of writ.

The peace officer to whom the warrant is directed shall execute it by bringing the party named and the person who detains the party, if so commanded by the warrant, before the judge issuing the warrant.  The person detaining the party shall make a return to the warrant as in the case of a writ of habeas corpus, and a proceeding shall be had as if a writ of habeas corpus had been issued in the first instance.

###### Sec. 12.75.210.   Proceedings as to person having party in custody.

If the person having the party in custody is brought before the court as for a criminal offense, the person shall be examined, committed, bailed, or discharged by the court in like manner as in other criminal cases of the same nature.

###### Sec. 12.75.220.   Penalty for refusing to deliver copy of or obey authority to detain party.

If a peace officer or other person refuses to deliver a copy of an order, warrant, process, or other authority by which the officer or other person detains a person to anyone who demands a copy and tenders the fees therefor, the officer or other person shall forfeit and pay to the person detained a sum of not more than $200.

###### Sec. 12.75.230.   Appeal.

A party to a proceeding by habeas corpus may appeal from the judgment of the court refusing to allow the writ or a final judgment therein in like manner and with like effect as in an action.  No question once finally determined upon a proceeding by habeas corpus shall be re-examined upon another or subsequent proceeding of the same kind.

## Chapter 80. Miscellaneous Provisions.

(b) At the initial court appearance or arraignment of a person for an offense, the court shall determine if the person's fingerprints have been taken in connection with the offense. If the court is unable to conclusively determine that the person's fingerprints have been taken, the court shall order the person to submit to fingerprinting within 24 hours at the appropriate correctional facility or another place for taking fingerprints that is more appropriate.

(c) When a defendant is sentenced or otherwise adjudicated for an offense, the court shall determine if legible fingerprints have been taken in connection with the proceedings.

If the Department of Public Safety finds that the person fingerprinted has criminal history record information under a name other than the name submitted with the fingerprints, the Department of Public Safety shall promptly notify the officer, agency, or facility that took the fingerprints.

(f) If the arresting officer, the law enforcement agency that employs the officer, or the correctional facility where fingerprints were taken is notified by the Department of Public Safety that fingerprints taken under this section are not legible, the officer, agency, or facility shall make a reasonable effort to obtain a legible set of fingerprints. If legible fingerprints cannot be obtained within a reasonable period of time, and if the illegible fingerprints were taken under a court order, the officer or agency shall inform the court, which shall order the defendant to submit to fingerprinting again.
