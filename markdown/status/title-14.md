If the census is five years old or older, then other reliable population data, including population estimates based on public school enrollments, public utility connections, registered voters, or certified employment payrolls, shall be used as the basis for the division of the area into sections. Each section within a regional educational attendance area shall consist of compact, contiguous territory and, as far as practicable, each section shall contain an integrated socio-economic, linguistically and culturally homogeneous area. In the division of the regional school and attendance area into sections, consideration shall be given to the transportation and communication network to facilitate the administration of education and communication between communities that comprise the area. Whenever possible, municipalities, other governmental or regional corporate entities, drainage basins, and other identifiable geographic features shall be used in describing the boundaries of the sections.

A petition under this section shall be filed with the director of elections and must contain signatures of qualified voters in the area equal to eight percent of the total vote cast in the most recent regional school board election. The division of the area into sections, election of each regional school board member from a section by the voters of that section, or subsequent recasting of section boundaries is subject to approval by a majority of the qualified voters voting on the question in the regional educational attendance area at the next regular school board election or a special election called for that purpose, and takes effect at the next regular school board election.

(c) If a regional educational attendance area has been divided into sections, the commissioner shall recast the boundaries of the sections within 90 days following the official reporting of the decennial federal census in accordance with (a) of this section. If the census is five years old or older and other reliable population data acceptable to the department that establishes that board members do not represent as nearly as practicable equal numbers of people under the allocation of seats to a multi-member section under (d) of this section, the commissioner may reallocate the seats among the sections if reallocation will achieve as nearly as practicable equal representation. Reallocation of seats takes effect at the next regular board election after the reallocation.

(d) Multi-member sections may be created.  However,

(1) each seat on the regional board shall be designated by letter or number and when the declaration of candidacy or other nomination papers of a candidate for the regional school board are filed those papers must indicate the seat that the candidate seeks; and

(2) except as provided in (f) of this section, a section may not be represented by more than

(A) three members, if a board consists of five members;

(B) four members, if a board consists of seven members;

(C) five members, if a board consists of nine members; or

(D) six members, if a board consists of 11 members.

(e) If a regional educational attendance area has been divided into sections, board members shall be residents of the section from which they are elected.  Board members shall be elected by the qualified voters of the entire regional educational attendance area, unless the voters have approved election of members by the voters of the section under (b) of this section.

(f) Upon the request of a regional school board, the commissioner may permit a section that contains more than one community to be represented by more board members than the number set out in (d)(2) of this section if the commissioner determines that

(1) the regional educational attendance area has had a pattern of substantial population fluctuations between geographic areas within the regional educational attendance area; and

(2) compliance with the requirements of (d)(2) of this section could result in continuous underrepresentation and overrepresentation of sections.

(g) In a regional educational attendance area section subject to (f) of this section, no more than two members may be elected from the same community unless the population distribution requires otherwise.

(i) for the first fiscal year after the base fiscal year determined under this subparagraph, the school district's ADM adjusted for school size determined under (A) of this paragraph is calculated as the district's ADM adjusted for school size, plus 75 percent of the difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size between the base fiscal year and the first fiscal year after the base fiscal year;

(ii) for the second fiscal year after the base fiscal year determined under this subparagraph, the school district's ADM adjusted for school size determined under (A) of this paragraph is calculated as the district's ADM adjusted for school size, plus 50 percent of the difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size between the base fiscal year and the second fiscal year after the base fiscal year;

(iii) for the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year determined under this subparagraph, the school district's ADM adjusted for school size determined under (A) of this paragraph is calculated as the district's ADM adjusted for school size, plus 25 percent of the difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size between the base fiscal year and the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year;

(F) the method established in (E) of this paragraph is available to a school district for the three fiscal years following the base fiscal year determined under (E) of this paragraph only if the district's ADM adjusted for school size determined under (A) of this paragraph for each fiscal year is less than the district's ADM adjusted for school size in the base fiscal year;

(G) the method established in (E) of this paragraph does not apply to a decrease in the district's ADM adjusted for school size resulting from a loss of enrollment that occurs as a result of a boundary change under AS 29;

(H)  notwithstanding (A)§(C) of this paragraph, if one or more schools close and consolidate with one or more other schools in the same community and district and, as a result of the consolidation, basic need generated by the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph decreases, the district may use the last fiscal year before the consolidation as the base fiscal year to offset that decrease for the first four fiscal years following consolidation according to the following method:

(i)  for the first two fiscal years after the base fiscal year, the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph is calculated by dividing the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph for the base fiscal year by the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without adjustment, and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph by the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, and adding that number to the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph;

(ii)  for the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year, the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph is calculated by dividing the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph for the base fiscal year by the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without adjustment, and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph by the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year, multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, multiplying that number by 66 percent, and adding that number to the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph;

(iii)  for the fourth fiscal year after the base fiscal year, the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph is calculated by dividing the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph for the base fiscal year by the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without adjustment, and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph by the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year, multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, multiplying that number by 33 percent, and adding that number to the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under (A)§(C) of this paragraph;

(iv)  to calculate the district's basic need for each fiscal year, the number obtained through the calculation in (i), (ii), or (iii) of this subparagraph is added to the number obtained under (C) of this paragraph for the remainder of the district;

(I)  if the basic need calculated under (H)(i)§(iii) of this paragraph for one of the first four fiscal years after consolidation is less than the basic need calculated under (A)§(C) of this paragraph for that fiscal year, the basic need may not be adjusted under (H) of this paragraph for that fiscal year;

(J)  a district may not offset a decrease under (H) of this paragraph if

(i)  a new facility is constructed in the district for the consolidation; or

(ii)  the district offset a decrease under (E) of this paragraph in the same fiscal year;

(K)  a district that offsets a decrease under (H) of this paragraph may not reopen a school that was closed for consolidation in the district until

(i)  seven or more years have passed since the school closure; and

(ii)  the district provides evidence satisfactory to the department that the schools affected by the consolidation are over capacity;

(L)  a district may not reopen and reconsolidate a school that was consolidated in the district more than once every seven years for purposes of the calculations made under (H) of this paragraph;

(M)  a district offsetting a decrease under (H) of this paragraph shall provide the department with the list of schools participating in the consolidation and the corresponding ADM;

(2) the required local contribution of a city or borough school district is the equivalent of a 2.65 mill tax levy on the full and true value of the taxable real and personal property in the district as of January 1 of the second preceding fiscal year, as determined by the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development under AS 14.17.510 and AS 29.45.110, not to exceed 45 percent of a district's basic need for the preceding fiscal year as determined under (1) of this subsection.

(c) In addition to the local contribution required under (b)(2) of this section, a city or borough school district in a fiscal year may make a local contribution of not more than the greater of

(1) the equivalent of a two mill tax levy on the full and true value of the taxable real and personal property in the district as of January 1 of the second preceding fiscal year, as determined by the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development under AS 14.17.510 and AS 29.45.110; or

(2) 23 percent of the total of the district's basic need for the fiscal year under (b)(1) of this section and any additional funding distributed to the district in a fiscal year according to (b) of this section.

(d) State aid may not be provided to a city or borough school district if the local contributions required under (b)(2) of this section have not been made.

(e) If a city or borough school district is established after July 1, 1998, for the first three fiscal years in which the city or borough school district operates schools, local contributions may be less than the amount that would otherwise be required under (b)(2) of this section, except that

(1) in the second fiscal year of operations, local contributions must be at least the greater of

(A) the local contributions, excluding federal impact aid, for the previous fiscal year; or

(B) the sum of 10 percent of the district's eligible federal impact aid for that year and the equivalent of a one mill tax levy on the full and true value of the taxable real and personal property in the city or borough school district as of January 1 of the second preceding fiscal year, as determined by the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development under AS 14.17.510 and AS 29.45.110; and

(2) in the third year of operation, local contributions must be at least the greater of

(A) the local contributions, excluding federal impact aid, for the previous fiscal year; or

(B) the sum of 10 percent of the district's eligible federal impact aid for that year and the equivalent of a two mill tax levy on the full and true value of the taxable real and personal property in the district as of January 1 of the second preceding fiscal year, as determined by the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development under AS 14.17.510 and AS 29.45.110.

(f) A school district is eligible for additional state aid in the amount by which the local contributions that would otherwise have been required under (b)(2) of this section exceed the district's actual local contributions under (e) of this section.

###### Sec. 14.17.420.   Funding for special needs, secondary school vocational and technical instruction, and intensive services.

(a) As a component of public school funding, a district is eligible for special needs and secondary school vocational and technical instruction funding and may be eligible for intensive services funding as follows:

(1) special needs funding is available to a district to assist the district in providing special education, gifted and talented education, vocational education, and bilingual education services to its students; a special needs funding factor of 1.20 shall be applied as set out in AS 14.17.410(b)(1);

(2) in addition to the special needs funding for which a district is eligible under (1) of this subsection, a district is eligible for intensive services funding for each special education student who needs and receives intensive services and is enrolled on the last day of the count period; for each such student, intensive services funding is equal to the intensive student count multiplied by 13;

(3) in addition to the special needs and intensive services funding available under (1) and (2) of this subsection, secondary school vocational and technical instruction funding is available to assist districts in providing vocational and technical instruction to students who are enrolled in a secondary school; a secondary school vocational and technical instruction funding factor of 1.015 shall be applied as set out in AS 14.17.410(b)(1); in this paragraph, "vocational and technical instruction" excludes costs associated with

(A) administrative expenses; and

(B) instruction in general literacy, mathematics, and job readiness skills.

(b) If a district offers special education, gifted and talented education, vocational education, or bilingual education services, in order to receive funding under (a)(1) of this section, the district must file with the department a plan that indicates the services that will be provided to students who receive these services.

(c) In this section, "intensive services" has the meaning given by the department by regulation adopted under AS 14.30.180§14.30.350.

###### Sec. 14.17.430.   State funding for correspondence study.

Except as provided in AS 14.17.400(b), funding for the state centralized correspondence study program or a district correspondence program, including a district that offers a statewide correspondence study program, includes an allocation from the public education fund in an amount calculated by multiplying the ADM of the correspondence program by 90 percent.

###### Sec. 14.17.440.   State funding for state boarding schools.

(a) Except as provided in AS 14.17.400(b), funding for state boarding schools established under AS 14.16.010 includes an allocation from the public education fund in an amount calculated by

(1) determining the ADM of state boarding schools by applying the school size factor to the student count as described in AS 14.17.450;

(2) multiplying the number obtained under (1) of this subsection by the special needs factor in AS 14.17.420(a)(1) and the secondary school vocational and technical instruction funding factor set out in AS 14.17.420(a)(3) and multiplying that product by the base student allocation; and

(3) multiplying the product determined under (2) of this subsection by the district cost factor that is applicable to calculation of the state aid for the adjacent school district under AS 14.17.460.

(b) State boarding schools are also eligible for intensive services funding under AS 14.17.420(a)(2).

###### Sec. 14.17.450.   School size factor.

(a) For purposes of calculating a school's ADM to determine state aid, the ADM of each school in a district shall be computed by applying the following formula:

If the student count in a school isThe adjusted student count is

At leastBut less thanBaseMultiplierThe number of students in excess of

10-2039.6

20-3039.6+(1.62x20)

30-7555.8+(1.49x30)

75-150122.85+(1.27x75)

150-250218.1+(1.08x150)

250-400326.1+(0.97x250)

400-750471.6+(0.92x400)

750 or over793.6+(0.84x750).

(b) If the ADM in a school is less than 10, those students shall be included in the ADM of the school in that district with the lowest ADM as determined by the most recent student count data for that district.

(c) Except as provided in (d) of this section, if the student count in a charter school is less than 150, the adjusted student count for the school shall be calculated by multiplying the student count by the student rate for a school that has a student count of 400.

(d) If a charter school has a student count of at least 75 but less than 150 for the current year and is in the first three years of operation or had a student count of at least 75 in the previous year of operation,

(1) the adjusted student count for the school shall be calculated by multiplying the student count by the student rate for a school that has a student count of 150; and

(2) not later than February 15, the charter school shall submit for approval of the governing board of the district a plan for the following school year that includes a statement about whether the school will continue to operate if the student count remains the same that year and, if so, a projection of the funding anticipated from the state and other sources, a proposed budget, and a description of anticipated changes to the school staff, program, and curriculum; if the school intends to close if the student count remains the same the following year, the plan must describe transfer plans for students, staff, facilities, and materials.

(e) If an alternative school has a student count of more than 120 but less than 175 for the current year and is in the first year of operation or had a student count of 175 or more in the previous year of operation, the adjusted student count for the school shall be calculated by multiplying the student count by 95 percent of the student rate for a school that has a student count of 175.

(f) In (c)§(e) of this section, "student rate" is calculated by adding the base and the multiplier provided under (a) of this section and dividing the sum by the student count.

###### Sec. 14.17.460.   District cost factors.

(a) For purposes of calculating a district's adjusted ADM under AS 14.17.410(b)(1), the district cost factor for a school district is (1) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, the factor set out under column (A) of this subsection, (2) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, the factor set out under column (B) of this subsection, (3) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, the factor set out under column (C) of this subsection, (4) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, the factor set out under column (D) of this subsection, and (5) for fiscal years ending on or after June 30, 2013, the factor set out under column (E) of this subsection:

###### Sec. 14.17.470.   Base student allocation.

[See delayed amendment note.]  The base student allocation is $5,930.

###### Sec. 14.17.480.   Quality school funding.

(a) As a component of public school funding, a district is eligible to receive a quality school funding grant not to exceed the district's adjusted ADM multiplied by $16. The department shall by regulation establish a grant process to implement this section.

(b) For purposes of the reduction required under AS 14.17.400(b), funding authorized under (a) of this section is treated the same as the state share of public school funding under AS 14.17.410.

###### Sec. 14.17.490.   Public school funding adjustments.

(a) Except as provided in (b)§(e) of this section, if, in fiscal year 1999, a city or borough school district or a regional educational attendance area would receive less public school funding under AS 14.17.410 than the district or area would have received as state aid, the district or area is, in each fiscal year, eligible to receive additional public school funding equal to the difference between the public school funding the district or area was eligible to receive under AS 14.17.410 in fiscal year 1999 and the state aid the district or area would have received in fiscal year 1999.

(b) A city or borough school district is not eligible for additional funding authorized under (a) of this section unless, during the fiscal year in which the district receives funding under (a) of this section, the district received a local contribution equal to at least the equivalent of a 2.65 mill tax levy on the full and true value of the taxable real and personal property in the district as of January 1 of the second preceding fiscal year as determined by the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development under AS 14.17.510 and AS 29.45.110.

(c) For the purposes of the reduction required under AS 14.17.400(b), funding authorized under (a) of this section is treated the same as the state share of public school funding under AS 14.17.410.

(d) Beginning in fiscal year 2000, if a district receives more public school funding under AS 14.17.410 than the district received in the preceding fiscal year, any amount received by the district under this section shall be reduced. The amount of the reduction required under this subsection is equal to the amount of increase from the preceding fiscal year in public school funding multiplied by 40 percent. In this subsection, "public school funding" does not include funding under this section.

(e) Beginning in fiscal year 2000, in each fiscal year, the department shall compare each district's ADM with the district's ADM in fiscal year 1999. If the current fiscal year ADM is less than 95 percent of the district's ADM in fiscal year 1999, the department shall reduce the district's public school funding calculated under (a) of this section by a percentage equal to the percentage of decrease in the district's ADM.

(f) For purposes of this section, "state aid" means state aid distributed under the provisions of AS 14.17, as those provisions read on January 1, 1998, and additional district support appropriated by the legislature for fiscal year 1998.

#### Article 2. Preparation of Public School Funding Budget.

###### Sec. 14.17.500.   Student count estimate.

(a) A district shall prepare and submit to the department by November 5 of each fiscal year, in the manner and on forms prescribed by the department, an estimate of its ADM and other student count data, including per school student count data, for the succeeding fiscal year upon which computations can be made to estimate the amount of state aid for which the district may be eligible under AS 14.17.400 in the succeeding fiscal year. In making its report, the district shall consider its ADM, other student count data, the pattern of growth or decline of the student population in preceding years, and other pertinent information available to the district.

(b) Part-time students shall be included in the student count data in accordance with regulations adopted by the department.

(c) When reporting a district's ADM, a part-time student who is a correspondence student may not be counted as more than one full-time equivalent student.

(d) [Effective July 1, 2023. See delayed amendment note.]  Except as provided in (e)§(g) of this section, a student in a district-wide early education program provided by a school district and approved by the department under AS 14.07.020(a)(8) is counted as one-half of a full-time equivalent student.

(e) [Effective July 1, 2023. See delayed repeal note.]  A school district may not include in a school's ADM students who are four and five years of age if the students are enrolled in an early education program that receives state or federal funding other than funding under this chapter.

(f) [Effective July 1, 2023. See delayed repeal note.]  A school district may not include in a school's ADM students who are four and five years of age if inclusion of the students would result in an increase of total state aid attributable to district-wide early education programs approved under AS 14.03.410 of more than $3,000,000 from the previous fiscal year. The department shall prioritize the funding of district-wide early education programs, giving priority to school districts with lower performance, based on the department's ranking of districts under AS 14.03.410(c). When the number of students in a district-wide early education program will result in an increase of total state aid attributable to district-wide early education programs approved under AS 14.03.410 of more than $3,000,000 from the previous fiscal year, the department may identify the amount, up to $3,000,000, available for the district's district-wide early education program.

(g) [Effective July 1, 2023. See delayed repeal note.]  For purposes of AS 14.09.010, a student in a district-wide early education program provided by a school district and approved by the department under AS 14.07.020(a)(8) is counted as a full-time equivalent student.

###### Sec. 14.17.505.   Fund balance in school operating fund.

(a) A district may not accumulate in a fiscal year an unreserved portion of its year-end fund balance in its school operating fund, as defined by department regulations, that is greater than 10 percent of its expenditures for that fiscal year.

(b) The department shall review each district's annual audit under AS 14.14.050 for the preceding fiscal year to ascertain its year-end operating fund balance. The amount by which the unreserved portion of that balance exceeds the amount permitted in (a) of this section shall be deducted from the state aid that would otherwise be paid to the district in the current fiscal year.

###### Sec. 14.17.510.   Determination of full and true value by Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development.

(a) To determine the amount of required local contribution under AS 14.17.410(b)(2) and to aid the department and the legislature in planning, the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development, in consultation with the assessor for each district in a city or borough, shall determine the full and true value of the taxable real and personal property in each district in a city or borough. If there is no local assessor or current local assessment for a city or borough school district, then the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development shall make the determination of full and true value guided by AS 29.45.110 and based on a determination of full and true value made by the state assessor at least every two years using the best information available, including on-site inspections made by the state assessor in each of those districts at least once every four years. For purposes of this subsection, the full and true value of taxable real and personal property in any area detached shall be excluded from the determination of the full and true value of the municipality from which the property was detached for the two years immediately preceding the effective date of the detachment. Also, in making the determination for a municipality that is a school district, or for a city that is within a borough school district, the assessed value of property taxable under AS 43.56 shall be excluded if a tax is not levied under AS 29.45.080 by the municipality that is the school district. The determination of full and true value shall be made by October 1 and sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, on or before that date to the president of the school board in each city or borough school district. Duplicate copies shall be sent to the commissioner. The governing body of a city or borough that is a school district may obtain judicial review of the determination. The superior court may modify the determination of the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development only upon a finding of abuse of discretion or upon a finding that there is no substantial evidence to support the determination.

(b) Motor vehicles subject to the motor vehicle registration tax under AS 28.10.431 shall be treated as taxable property under this section.

The evaluating administrator shall consult with the tenured teacher in setting clear, specific performance expectations to be included in the plan of improvement. The plan of improvement must address ways in which the tenured teacher's performance can be improved and shall last for not less than 90 workdays and not more than 180 workdays unless the minimum time is shortened by agreement between the evaluating administrator and the teacher. The plan of improvement shall be based on the professional performance standards outlined in the locally adopted school district evaluation procedure.

###### Sec. 14.20.177.   Reductions in force.

(a) A school district may implement a layoff plan under this section if it is necessary for the district to reduce the number of tenured teachers because

(1) school attendance in the district has decreased; or

(2) the basic need of the school district determined under AS 14.17.410(b)(1) decreases by three percent or more from the previous year.

(b) Before a school district lays off any tenured teacher, the school board shall adopt a layoff plan. The plan must identify academic and other programs that the district intends to maintain in implementing the layoff plan. The plan must also include procedures for layoff and recall of tenured teachers consistent with this section.

(c) Except as provided in this subsection, a school district may place a tenured teacher on layoff status only after the district has given notice of nonretention to all nontenured teachers. However, a school district may retain a nontenured teacher and place on layoff status a tenured teacher if there is no tenured teacher in the district who is qualified to replace the nontenured teacher. The school district shall comply with the notice requirements set out in AS 14.20.140 in placing a tenured or nontenured teacher on layoff status.

(e) For a period of three years after layoff, a teacher is on layoff status and is entitled to a hiring preference in the district where the teacher had been employed. The hiring preference applies only to vacant teaching positions for which the teacher is qualified. If a teacher is offered a teaching position under this subsection and the teacher declines the offer or fails to accept it within 30 days, the teacher is no longer considered to be on layoff status and is no longer entitled to a hiring preference under this section unless the teacher declines the offer because the teacher is contractually obligated to provide professional services to another private or public educational program.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of AS 23.40, the terms of a collective bargaining agreement entered into between a school district and a bargaining organization representing teachers on or after August 16, 1996, may not be in conflict with the provisions of this section.

The dismissal is effective when the notice is delivered to the teacher.

(d) Upon receipt of a request for a hearing, the employer shall immediately schedule a hearing and notify the teacher in writing of the date, time, and place of the hearing.

The teacher has the right to subpoena a person who has made statements that are used as a basis for the employer's decision to dismiss or nonretain. A written transcript, tape, or similar recording of the proceedings shall be kept. A copy of the recording shall be furnished to the teacher, for cost, upon request of the teacher. A decision of the school board requires a majority vote of the membership, by roll call. The board's decision shall be in writing and must contain specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. A copy of the decision shall be furnished to the teacher within 10 days after the date of the decision. If the school board sustains the dismissal or nonretention, the teacher may appeal the decision to the superior court for judicial review based on the administrative record.

(e) Upon receipt of a notice invoking the grievance procedures, the school board shall immediately schedule an informal hearing and notify the teacher in writing of the date, time, and place of the hearing. The hearing is for the purpose of reviewing the statement of cause and bill of particulars and not for the purpose of taking evidence. The teacher may choose whether the informal hearing is held in public or in private. A decision of the school board requires a majority vote of the membership, by roll call. The board's decision shall be in writing. The board shall promptly furnish a copy of the decision to the teacher. If the board sustains the dismissal or nonretention, the teacher may, within 15 days after receipt of the decision, give written notice to the school board and submit the matter to arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The decision of the arbitrator is final and binding on the school board, the teacher, and the bargaining organization representing the teacher, if any. If the school board and the teacher agree, they may waive the informal hearing under this subsection and submit the matter directly to arbitration.

(a) Unless it is otherwise agreed, a teacher returning from sabbatical leave shall return to the position occupied by that teacher when the sabbatical leave began.

(b) A sabbatical leave is not an interruption of the continuous service necessary to attain or retain tenure under AS 14.20.150, 14.20.155, or 14.20.160. However, the time spent on sabbatical leave may not be counted in determining when a teacher has sufficient service to enable the teacher to acquire tenure rights.

(c) The leave of absence is not a break in service for retirement purposes.

(d) The governing body of the district may agree to continue the teacher's retirement contributions if the teacher agrees to pay the percent required under AS 14.25.050 of the salary the teacher would have received during the leave of absence and reimburse the district for the district's required retirement contribution. Each year of leave of absence then would count as a year of retirement service.

(e) The governing body of the district may advance the teacher on the district salary schedule when the teacher returns to employment if the governing body determines that the teacher's leave of absence was educationally or professionally beneficial to the teacher or the district.

(f) A teacher may make contributions to the retirement fund for each year or portion of a year of leave of absence taken.  The contribution shall include the required percent of the salary the teacher would have received had the leave of absence not been taken, plus the required employer and state contributions that would have been made.

#### Article 6. Interstate Agreement on Qualification of Educational Personnel.

###### Sec. 14.20.620.   Entry into agreement.

The interstate Agreement on Qualification of Educational Personnel is enacted into law and entered into in behalf of the State of Alaska with all other states and jurisdictions legally joining in it in a form substantially as contained in AS 14.20.630.

###### Sec. 14.20.630.   Terms and provisions of agreement.

The terms and provisions of the agreement referred to in AS 14.20.620 are as follows:

INTERSTATE AGREEMENT ON QUALIFICATION OF EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL.

(1) The states party to this agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession. It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.

(2) The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations. Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states. As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their states of origin, can increase the available educational resources.  Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.

As used in this agreement and contracts made pursuant to it, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

(1) "Educational personnel" means persons who must meet requirements pursuant to state law as a condition of employment in educational programs.

(2) "Designated state official" means the education official of a state selected by that state to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of the state, contracts pursuant to this agreement.

(3) "Accept," or any variant thereof, means to recognize and give effect to one or more determinations of another state relating to the qualifications of educational personnel in lieu of making or requiring a like determination that would otherwise be required by or pursuant to the laws of a receiving state.

(4) "State" means a state, territory, or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

(5) "Originating state" means a state (and the subdivisions thereof, if any) whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acceptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.

(6) "Receiving state" means a state (and the subdivisions thereof) which accept educational personnel in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.

(1) The designated state official of a party state may make one or more contracts on behalf of that state with one or more other party states providing for the acceptance of educational personnel. Any such contract for the period of its duration shall be applicable to and binding on the states whose designated state officials enter into it, and the subdivisions of those states, with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this agreement. A designated state official may enter into a contract pursuant to this article only with states in which the state official finds that there are programs of education, certification standards or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or qualification of educational personnel on a basis sufficiently comparable, even though not identical to that prevailing in the official's state.

(2) Any such contract shall provide for:

(a) Its duration.

(b) The criteria to be applied by an originating state in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving state.

(c) Such waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptances as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards.

(d) Any other necessary matters.

(3) No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall be for a term longer than five years but any such contract may be renewed for like or lesser periods.

(4) Any contract dealing with acceptance of educational personnel on the basis of their having completed an educational program shall specify the earliest date or dates on which originating state approval of the program or programs involved can have occurred. No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall require acceptance by a receiving state of any persons qualified because of successful completion of a program prior to January 1, 1954.

(5) The certification or other acceptance of a person who has been accepted pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or been terminated. However, any certificate or other qualifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a certificate or other qualifying document initially granted or approved in the receiving state.

(6) A contract committee composed of the designated state officials of the contracting states or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of improving its administration, and report no less frequently than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting states.

(1) Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to repeal or otherwise modify any law or regulation of a party state relating to the approval of programs of educational preparation having effect solely on the qualification of educational personnel within that state.

(2) To the extent that contracts made pursuant to this agreement deal with the educational requirements for the proper qualification of educational personnel, acceptance of a program of educational preparation shall be in accordance with such procedures and requirements as may be provided in the applicable contract.

The party states agree that:

(1) They will, so far as practicable, prefer the making of multilateral contracts pursuant to Article III of this agreement.

(2) They will facilitate and strengthen cooperation in interstate certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification and for this purpose shall cooperate with agencies, organizations, and associations interested in certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification.

The designated state officials of any party states may meet from time to time as a group to evaluate progress under the agreement, and to formulate recommendations for changes.

Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent or inhibit other arrangements or practices of any party state or states to facilitate the interchange of educational personnel.

(1) This agreement shall become effective when enacted into law by two states. Thereafter it shall become effective as to any state upon its enactment of this agreement.

(2) Any party state may withdraw from this agreement by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.

(3) No withdrawal shall relieve the withdrawing state of any obligation imposed upon it by a contract to which it is a party. The duration of contracts and the methods and conditions of withdrawal therefrom shall be those specified in their terms.

This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States, or the application thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

###### Sec. 14.20.640.   Designated state official to make contracts.

The designated state official to make contracts on behalf of the state under Article III of the agreement shall be the commissioner.

###### Sec. 14.20.650.   Filing and publishing of contracts.

True copies of all contracts made on behalf of this state under the agreement shall be kept on file in the office of the commissioner and in the office of the lieutenant governor. The department shall publish all the contracts in convenient form.

###### Sec. 14.20.680.   Required alcohol and drug related disabilities training.

(a) A school district or regional educational attendance area shall train each teacher, administrator, counselor, and specialist on the needs of individual students who have alcohol or drug related disabilities.  The training must utilize the best available educational technology and include an overview of medical and psychological characteristics associated with alcohol or drug related disabilities, family issues, and the specific educational needs of students with alcohol or drug related disabilities.

###### Sec. 14.25.040.   Membership; credited service.

(b) A state legislator who was an active member of this plan under other sections of AS 14.25.009§14.25.220 within the 12 months immediately preceding election to office may elect to be an active member of this plan for as long as the state legislator serves continuously as a state legislator subject to the requirements of (c) of this section, if, within 90 days after taking the oath of office,

(1) the state legislator directs the employer in writing to

(A) pay into this plan the employer contributions required for a member under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220; and

(B) deduct from the state legislator's salary and pay into this plan

(i) the employee contributions required for a member under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220; and

(ii) an amount equal to the difference between the total employer and state contributions required for a member under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220 and the employer contributions which would be required under the public employees' retirement system (AS 39.35) if the legislator were covered under that system; and

(2) notice is given the administrator in writing.

(c) A state legislator is not entitled to elect membership under (b) of this section if the state legislator is covered for the same period of service under the public employees' retirement system (AS 39.35). An election of membership under (b) of this section is retroactive to the date the state legislator took the oath of office. A state legislator may not receive membership credit under (b) of this section for legislative service performed before the legislative session during which the state legislator elected membership under (b) of this section. In order to continue in membership service under (b) of this section, the state legislator must earn at least 0.3 years of membership service under other sections of AS 14.25.009§14.25.220 during each five-year period.

However, the amount of credited service a person receives under the public employees' retirement plan during a school year may not exceed the amount necessary, when added to the amount of credited service earned during the school year under the plan, to equal one year of credited service. A person who was employed at least half-time in a position in the public employees' retirement plan under AS 39.35.095§39.35.680 in the same period that the person was employed at least half-time in a position in this plan may claim credited service in both plans for employment before May 31, 1989. To obtain this credited service, the person shall claim the service and verify the period of half-time employment. When eligibility for half-time service credit has been established, an indebtedness shall be determined to the retirement plan in which the person did not participate. The amount of the indebtedness is the full actuarial cost of providing benefits for the credited service claimed. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on that indebtedness beginning on the later of July 1, 1989, or the date on which the member is first eligible to claim the service. Any outstanding indebtedness existing at the time the person retires will require an actuarial adjustment to the benefits payable based on that service.

(e) A teacher who is assaulted while on the job, who files for benefits under AS 23.30, and who, as a result of a physical injury from the assault, is placed on leave without pay, whether or not the teacher is receiving benefits under AS 23.30 for the injury, is entitled to accrue credited service while the teacher, because of the injury, is on leave-without-pay status or is receiving workers' compensation benefits under AS 23.30. Entitlement to earn credited service under this subsection ends when the teacher is eligible to receive benefits under AS 14.25.110(a) or 14.25.130(a).

###### Sec. 14.25.043.   Reemployment of retired members.

(a) Except as provided in (f) of this section, if a retired member again becomes an active member, benefit payments may not be made during the period of reemployment. During the period of reemployment, deductions from the member's salary will be made in accordance with AS 14.25.050.

(b) [Repealed,§12 ch 57 SLA 2001 as amended by§6 ch 15 SLA 2003 and§10 ch 50 SLA 2005.]

(c) Except as provided in (f) of this section, upon subsequent retirement, the retired member is entitled to receive an additional benefit based on the credited service and the average base salary during the period of reemployment in accordance with AS 14.25.110. If the initial benefit payments to which the retired member is eligible have been actuarially reduced because the member retired early under AS 14.25.110(b), the member shall also receive an incremental benefit based on the amount of the actuarial reduction imposed by AS 14.25.110(j) on the first benefit and the length of time that the employee was reemployed and not receiving retirement benefits. The amount of the incremental benefit is equal to the difference between the normal retirement benefit to which the member would have been entitled had the member taken a normal retirement and the early retirement benefit that the member has been receiving based on the member's initial period of employment multiplied by the total number of months that the member did not receive retirement benefits because of reemployment and that amount actuarially adjusted to be paid over the expected lifetime of the member.

(d) A member who retired under AS 14.25.110(a) and participated in a retirement incentive program under ch. 26, SLA 1986; ch. 89, SLA 1989; ch. 65, SLA 1996; ch. 4, FSSLA 1996; or ch. 92, SLA 1997, who is subsequently reemployed as a commissioner may become an active member without losing the incentive credit provided under the applicable retirement incentive plan and is not subject to any related reemployment indebtedness.

(e) [Repealed,§6 ch 15 SLA 2003 as amended by§10 ch 50 SLA 2005.]

(f) If a member who retired under AS 14.25.110(a) is reemployed by a school district under AS 14.20.136,

(1) the member does not become an active member;

(2) the member shall continue to receive retirement benefits from the plan as though the member were not reemployed by the school district;

(3) deductions from the member's salary may not be made under AS 14.25.050; and

(4) the member may not receive credited service in the plan during the period of reemployment.

(g) Notwithstanding (f) of this section, a member who is retired under AS 14.25.110(a) and reemployed by a school district under AS 14.20.136 is eligible to receive the group health plan coverage provided to active members employed by that school district.

###### Sec. 14.25.047.   Participation by Special Education Service Agency employees.

An employee of the Special Education Service Agency may participate in the plan under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220 if

(1) the employee possesses or is eligible to possess a teacher certificate under AS 14.20.020; and

(2) the employee pays all retroactive contributions required to be made under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220.

###### Sec. 14.25.048.   Teachers of Alaska Native language and culture.

(a) Except as provided in (d) of this section, an employee employed by a participating employer on or after June 5, 1988, shall participate in the plan under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220 if the employee

(1) teaches Alaska Native language or culture in a permanent full-time or permanent part-time position;

(2) learned about the subject to be taught by living in the culture or using the language in daily life; and

(3) is qualified to teach the subject to elementary or secondary students as required by regulations adopted by the Department of Education and Early Development.

(b) An employee or former employee may receive credit for retroactive membership service for employment before June 5, 1988 if the employee or former employee met the requirements listed in (a) of this section at the time of the employment. To receive credit for the retroactive membership service, the employee or former employee shall claim the service and pay the retroactive contributions required under AS 14.25.061. However, an employee or former employee may not receive retroactive credit under this subsection if the employee received credited service under AS 39.35 for the employment.

(c) An employee or former employee who received credit under AS 39.35 for service that qualifies under (a) of this section may elect to transfer those periods of employment to the plan. To receive credit for retroactive membership service under this subsection, the employee or former employee shall claim the service and pay the retroactive contributions required under AS 14.25.061.

(d) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, an employee employed as a teacher of Alaska Native language and culture and participating in the Public Employees' Retirement System under AS 39.35 on the day before June 5, 1988 shall remain a member under AS 39.35 unless the employee elects to become a member of the Teachers' Retirement System on or before September 3, 1988.

###### Sec. 14.25.050.   Contributions by members.

(a) Except as provided in (c) of this section, beginning January 1, 1991, each member shall contribute to the plan an amount equal to 8.65 percent of the member's base salary accrued from July 1 to the following June 30. The employer shall deduct the contribution from the member's salary at the end of each payroll period, and the contribution shall be credited by the plan to the member contribution account. The contributions shall be deducted from employee compensation before the computation of applicable federal taxes and shall be treated as employer contributions under 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A member may not have the option of making the payroll deduction directly in cash instead of having the contribution picked up by the employer.

(b) Each teacher is entitled to receive credit for unrefunded contributions paid into the retirement fund of 1945.

(c) The employer of a teacher who, because of a physical injury caused by an on-the-job assault, is on unpaid leave of absence or is receiving benefits under AS 23.30 shall pay the teacher's contributions required by this section while the teacher is on unpaid leave or receiving the workers' compensation benefits.

(d) A teacher who is placed on leave of absence without pay because the teacher is unable to work due to an on-the-job injury or occupational illness for which the teacher is receiving benefits under AS 23.30 and for which the teacher is not entitled to credited service under AS 14.25.040(e) may elect to receive credited service for the time on leave of absence without pay status. When a teacher elects to receive credited service under this subsection, an indebtedness is established. The amount of the indebtedness is equal to the contributions that the teacher would have made if the teacher had been working. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues on the indebtedness beginning on the date that the teacher returns to work or terminates employment. If there is an outstanding indebtedness at the time the teacher is appointed to retirement, benefits shall be actuarially adjusted.

###### Sec. 14.25.055.   Supplemental contributions by teachers.

If a teacher first joined the plan before July 1, 1982, and is married or has a minor child and wishes to make a spouse or minor child eligible for a spouse's pension or a survivor's allowance, the teacher may elect to make a supplemental contribution of an additional one percent of the teacher's base salary within 90 days of the teacher's entry into participation in the plan, or within 90 days of marriage, or within 90 days of the birth or adoption of a child dependent upon the teacher.  Once an election is made under this section, supplemental contributions must be made whenever contributions are required under AS 14.25.050 unless the teacher executes a written waiver with the administrator.  The execution of a waiver relinquishes all rights and benefits previously accrued under AS 14.25.162 and 14.25.164.

###### Sec. 14.25.060.   Arrearage indebtedness.

(a) If a member first joined the plan before July 1, 1990, and has military service or Alaska Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) service, or if a member joined the plan before July 1, 1978, and has creditable outside service, the member may claim this service. If the member claims the service, the member is indebted to the plan as follows:

(1) at the time of first becoming a member of the plan, the arrearage indebtedness is seven percent of the base salary multiplied by the total number of years of creditable outside, military, and Alaska BIA service; the administrator shall add compound interest at the rate prescribed by regulation to the arrearage indebtedness beginning July 1, 1963, or at the time the member first becomes eligible to claim the service, whichever is later, to the date of payment or the date of retirement, whichever occurs first;

(2) if a member terminates from the plan and is subsequently reemployed as a member, the arrearage indebtedness to the plan for outside, military, or Alaska BIA service accumulated in the interim is seven percent of the base salary upon reentering membership service, multiplied by the number of years of interim outside, military, and Alaska BIA service; compound interest at the rate prescribed by regulation shall be added to the arrearage indebtedness beginning July 1, 1963, or the date of reemployment as a member, whichever is later, to the date of payment or the date of retirement, whichever occurs first.

(b) If a member joins the plan on or after July 1, 1978, and has creditable outside service, the member may claim this service.  If claimed, the member is indebted to the plan as follows:

(1) The arrearage indebtedness is the full actuarial cost of providing benefits for the service being claimed.  Compound interest at the rate prescribed by regulation shall be added to the arrearage indebtedness beginning the date the actuarial cost is established to the date of payment or the date of retirement, whichever occurs first.

(2) If a member terminates from the plan and is subsequently reemployed as a member, the arrearage indebtedness for outside service during the interim is the full actuarial cost of providing benefits for the interim service being claimed. Compound interest at the rate prescribed by regulation shall be added to the arrearage indebtedness beginning the date the actuarial cost is established to the date of payment or the date of retirement, whichever occurs first.

(c) The total military service claimed may not exceed five years. The combined total of outside and military service may not exceed 10 years, except that, if entry into the armed forces is immediately preceded by membership service and within one year after discharge is continued by membership service, that service may not be counted for purposes of determining the applicability of the 10-year limitation on the combined total of outside and military service.

(d) If a member first joined the plan on or after July 1, 1990, and has military service or Alaska BIA service, the member's indebtedness shall be determined under (a) of this section except that the percentage multiplier is 8.65 percent.

###### Sec. 14.25.061.   Retroactive indebtedness.

(a) A member who was not subject to the provisions of AS 14.25.009§14.25.220, but who becomes subject to them because of a legislative change, may elect to receive credit for retroactive membership service by contributing to the plan an amount equal to the contributions the member would have made had the member been subject to the provisions of AS 14.25.009§14.25.220 for those years of retroactive service after June 30, 1955.  Retroactive contributions are not required for retroactive membership service before July 1, 1955. Compound interest at the rate prescribed by regulation shall be added to the retroactive indebtedness from July 1, 1966, or the time of first becoming eligible under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220, whichever is later, to the date of payment or the date of retirement, whichever occurs first.

(b) If retroactive indebtedness contributions have been made for retroactive service before July 1, 1955, the member is entitled to a refund of those retroactive membership indebtedness contributions.

(c)  [Repealed,§133 ch 9 FSSLA 2005.]

###### Sec. 14.25.062.   Reinstatement indebtedness. [Repealed,§133, ch 9 FSSLA 2005.]

###### Sec. 14.25.063.   Payment of indebtedness.

(a) In AS 14.25.009§14.25.220, a member does not have to be reemployed under this plan in order to make indebtedness payments.  However, except as provided in (d) of this section, a former member must be reemployed under this plan in order to make indebtedness payments.  Payments apply first to accrued interest and then to principal.

(b) Any outstanding indebtedness that exists at the time a member is appointed to retirement will necessitate an actuarial adjustment to the benefits payable based on the member's corresponding service.

(c) If, as a result of service credit claimed for which there is a corresponding indebtedness existing at retirement, the member's retirement benefit is actuarially reduced and the resulting benefit is less than it would have been if the service credit had not been claimed, the retirement benefit shall be equal to the amount it would have been had the service credit never been claimed.

(d) A former member who received a total refund of the member's contribution account balance because of a levy under AS 09.38.065 or a federal tax levy may make indebtedness payments under this section.

###### Sec. 14.25.065.   Transmittal of contributions; claims against funds of an employer.

(a) All contributions deducted in accordance with AS 14.25.050 and 14.25.055 shall be transmitted to the plan for deposit in the retirement fund no later than 15 days following the close of the payroll period, with the final contributions due for any school year transmitted no later than July 15.

(b) The contributions of employers under AS 14.25.070 must be transmitted to the plan for deposit in the retirement fund and the Alaska retiree health care trust at the close of each pay period. If the contributions are not submitted within the prescribed time limit, interest must be assessed on the outstanding contributions at one and one-half times the most recent actuarially determined rate of earnings for the plan from the date that contributions were originally due. Amounts due from an employer and interest as prescribed in this section may be claimed by the administrator from any agency of the state or political subdivision that has in its possession funds of the employer or that is authorized to disburse funds to the employer that are not restricted by statute or appropriation to a specific purpose. The amount claimed shall be certified by the administrator as sufficient to pay the contributions and interest due from the employer. The amount claimed shall be submitted to the administrator for deposit in the retirement fund and the Alaska retiree health care trust.

###### Sec. 14.25.070.   Contributions by employers.

(a) Each employer shall contribute to the system every payroll period an amount calculated by applying a rate of 12.56 percent to the total of all base salaries paid by the employer to active members of the system and to members who are retired from the plan and reemployed under AS 14.20.136, including any adjustments to contributions required by AS 14.25.173(a).

(b) The employer shall transmit the contributions calculated in (a) of this section to the administrator in accordance with AS 14.25.065. The administrator shall allocate contributions received for full payment of

(1) the actuarially determined employer normal cost for the plan; and

(2) all contributions required by AS 14.25.350 and AS 39.30.370 for the fiscal year.

(c) If, after allocation of contributions under (b) of this section, a portion of the employer contributions remains, the administrator shall apply that remaining portion toward payment of the past service liability of the plan.

(d) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, the annual employer contribution rate may not be less than the rate sufficient to allow payment of the employer normal cost and the employer contributions required under AS 14.25.350 and AS 39.30.370.

(e) [Repealed, "" 83, 84, and 86, ch. 41, SLA 2009.]

(f) All or a portion of the employer's share of any accrued actuarial liability to the plan may be prepaid in a lump sum. The commissioner of administration may, by regulation, establish a minimum amount for the lump sum payment of a portion. The administrator shall charge to the employer appropriate and reasonable administrative costs to the plan attributable to a lump sum payment that are not greater than administrative costs applied to other employer contributions. If an employer is grouped with any other employer in accounting for contributions, the lump sum payment for the employer shall be accounted for separately in accordance with regulations adopted by the commissioner. The regulations must provide for crediting to each lump sum payment account all earnings and losses received from investment of that payment. The lump sum payment shall be used solely to offset contributions under this section required of the employer for which the payment was made, taking into account earnings and losses from its investment. A lump sum payment made by or on behalf of an employer under this subsection, together with all earnings and losses from investment of that payment, may not be considered in calculating that employer's share of any discretionary payment authorized by the state that benefits multiple employers.

(g) If all or a portion of an employer's share of any accrued actuarial liability to the plan is prepaid in a lump sum under (f) of this section, the administrator shall calculate a revised employer contribution rate for that employer in recognition of that prepayment not more than 30 days following the prepayment.

(h) In this section, "normal cost" means the cost of providing the benefits expected to be credited, with respect to service, to all active members of the plan during the year beginning after the last valuation date.

###### Sec. 14.25.075.   Purchase of credited service.

(a) An employee who is eligible to purchase credited service under AS 14.25.047 or 14.25.048, a member who is eligible to purchase credited service under AS 14.25.048, 14.25.050, 14.25.060, 14.25.061, 14.25.100, or 14.25.107, or a teacher who is eligible to purchase credited service under AS 14.20.345, AS 14.25.050, or 14.25.105, in lieu of making payments directly to the plan, may elect to have the member's employer make payments as provided in this section.

(b) A member may elect to have the employer make payments for all or any portion of the amounts payable for the member's purchase of credited service through a salary reduction program as follows:

(1) the amounts paid under a salary reduction program are in lieu of contributions by the member making the election; the electing member's salary or other compensation shall be reduced by the amount paid by the employer under this subsection;

(2) the member shall make an irrevocable election under this subsection to purchase credited service as permitted in AS 14.20.345, AS 14.25.047, 14.25.048, 14.25.050, 14.25.060, 14.25.061, 14.25.100, 14.25.105, or 14.25.107 before the member's termination of employment; the irrevocable election must specify the number of payroll periods that deductions will be made from the member's compensation and the dollar amount of deductions for each payroll period during the specified number of payroll periods; the deductions made under this paragraph cease upon the earlier of the member's termination of employment with the employer or the member's death; amounts paid by an employer under (f) of this section may not be applied toward the payment of the dollar amount of the deductions representing the portion of the credited service that is being purchased by the member through payroll deduction in accordance with the member's irrevocable election under this paragraph;

(3) amounts paid by an employer under this subsection shall be treated as employer contributions for the purpose of determining tax treatment under 26 U.S.C. (Internal Revenue Code); the amounts paid by the employer under this section may not be included in the member's gross income for income tax purposes until those amounts are distributed by refund or retirement benefit payments.

(c) Unless otherwise provided, member contributions paid by the employer under this section are treated for all other purposes under the plan in the same manner and to the same extent as member contributions that are not paid by an employer under this section and AS 14.25.050. The plan may assess interest or administrative charges attributable to any salary reduction election made under this section. The interest or administrative charges shall be added to the contribution that is made to the plan by the member each payroll period, and that is paid by the employer. The interest or administrative charges may not be treated as member contributions for any purposes under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220, and a member or a member's beneficiary does not have a right to the return of the interest or administrative charges under any other provision of this section. Interest assessed under this section shall be at the rate specified by regulations adopted by the administrator.

(d) For plan fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2001, the requirements of AS 14.25.110(k) may not be applied to reduce the amount of credited service that may be purchased under this section by a member who first becomes an employee of the plan before July 1, 2001, to an amount that is less than the amount of credited service allowed to be purchased with the application of any of the limits prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 415.

(e) Contributions to the plan to purchase credited service under this section do not qualify for treatment under this section if recognition of that service would cause a member to receive a retirement benefit for the same service from the plan and from one or more other retirement plans or systems of the state.

(f) The administrator may accept rollover contributions from a member. Contributions made under this subsection may not be applied to purchase service being paid under (b) of this section. A rollover contribution as described in this subsection shall be treated as employer contributions for the purpose of determining tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code and may be made by any one or a combination of the following methods:

(1) subject to the limitations prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 402(c), accepting eligible rollover distributions directly from one or more eligible retirement plans as defined by 26 U.S.C. 402(c)(8)(B);

(2) subject to the limitations prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 403(b)(13), accepting direct trustee-to-trustee transfers of all or a portion of the accounts of the member, on or after January 1, 2002, from a tax sheltered annuity described in 26 U.S.C. 403(b);

(3) subject to the limitations prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 457(e)(17), accepting direct trustee-to-trustee transfers of all or a portion of the accounts of the member, on or after January 1, 2002, from an eligible deferred compensation plan of a tax-exempt organization or a state or local government described in 26 U.S.C. 457(b);

(4) accepting direct trustee-to-trustee transfer from an account established for the benefit of the member in AS 39.30.150§39.30.180 (Alaska Supplemental Annuity Plan).

(g) Payments made under this section shall be applied to reduce the member's outstanding indebtedness described in AS 14.25.063 at the time that the contributions are received by the plan.

(h) If a member retires before all payments are made under this section, the plan shall calculate the member's benefits based only on the payments actually made with respect to the credited service purchased.

(i) On satisfaction of the eligibility requirements of AS 14.20.345, AS 14.25.047, 14.25.048, 14.25.050, 14.25.060, 14.25.061, 14.25.100, 14.25.105, or 14.25.107, the requirements of this section, and the administrative filing requirements specified by the administrator, the plan shall adjust the member's credited service history and add any additional service credits acquired.

(j) After an election is made under this section, the election is binding on and irrevocable for the member and the member's employer during the member's remaining period of current employment. After a member makes an irrevocable election under this section, the member does not have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly in cash.

###### Sec. 14.25.080.   Contributions by the state. [Repealed,§25 ch 91 SLA 1987.]

###### Sec. 14.25.085.   Additional state contributions.

In addition to the contributions that the state is required to make under AS 14.25.070 as an employer, the state shall contribute to the plan each July 1 or, if funds are not available on July 1, as soon after July 1 as funds become available, an amount for the ensuing fiscal year that, when combined with the total employer contributions that the administrator estimates will be allocated under AS 14.25.070(c), is sufficient to pay the plan's past service liability at the contribution rate adopted by the board under AS 37.10.220 for that fiscal year.

###### Sec. 14.25.087.   Contributions for medical benefits.

Contributions made by an employer under AS 14.25.070 and 14.25.085 shall be separately computed for benefits provided by AS 14.25.168 and shall be deposited in the Alaska retiree health care trust established under AS 39.30.097(a).

(a) A member who served as an active member of the armed forces of the United States may receive credited service under this plan up to a maximum of five years if the member received a discharge under other than dishonorable conditions and is not entitled to receive retirement benefits from the United States government for the same service.  Each 12 months of military service equals one school year, and lesser military periods will be determined for credit purposes in a proportionate ratio to a year.   Credit for service in the armed forces shall be granted only if the member makes contributions for the service in the same manner as required for outside service under  AS 14.25.060.  The military service credited under this section shall be included in the 10-year limitation of outside service as specified in  AS 14.25.060, except if entry into the armed forces is immediately preceded by Alaska membership service and following discharge is continued by Alaska membership service within one year thereafter, service may not be counted for purposes of determining the applicability of the 10-year limitation on outside service.

(b) Where a member is unable to resume teaching in a public school within one year following discharge because of hospitalization, rehabilitation training, a disability derived while in the armed forces, or other like circumstances, the administrator shall determine the allowance or disallowance of any service in the armed forces.

If there is no surviving spouse, the administrator shall pay the monthly survivor's pension in equal parts to the dependent children of the member.  On the date the normal retirement of the member would have occurred if the member had lived, monthly payments must equal the monthly amount of the normal retirement benefit to which the member, had the member lived and continued employment until the member's normal retirement date, would have been entitled with an average base salary as existed at the member's death and the credited service to which the member would have been entitled.  If the member does not have a spouse or dependent children at the time of death or if the member designates as beneficiary under AS 14.25.166 someone other than the surviving spouse or dependent children, the administrator shall pay the member's designated beneficiary those benefits available to a beneficiary under AS 14.25.160(b) and (c) and may not pay a benefit to the surviving spouse or dependent children.

(c) Benefits are not payable under this section if benefits are payable under AS 14.25.155, 14.25.160, 14.25.162, 14.25.164, or 14.25.167.

(d) If a member's death is caused by an act of assault, assassination, or terrorism directly related to the person's status as a member, whether the act occurs on or off the member's job site, the death shall be considered to have occurred in the performance of and within the scope of the member's duties for purposes of (a)(2) of this section. If the expressed or apparent motive and intent of the perpetrator of the harm inflicted upon the member was due to the performance of the member's job duties or employment as a member, the death shall be considered to be directly related to the member's status as a member. A member's job duties are those performed within the course and scope of the member's employment with an employer.

###### Sec. 14.25.160.   Death benefits.

(a) A death benefit shall be paid and any supplemental contributions shall be refunded to the designated beneficiary, upon receipt of a valid claim and proof of the death of a member who

If a retired member or deferred vested member dies, a pension is payable to the member's spouse if the member made supplemental contributions under AS 14.25.055 for at least five years of credited service. Application for the spouse's pension must be made in writing to the administrator.

(b) A spouse's pension is payable under this section as follows:

(1) a spouse's pension is equal to 50 percent of the retirement benefit that the deceased member was receiving; if the member was not receiving a retirement benefit, the spouse's pension is equal to 50 percent of the amount the member would have received, based on the member's average base salary and credited service to the date of the member's death and assuming that the member would have been eligible for a normal retirement benefit as of that date;

If payment is delayed, a retroactive payment must be made for the month in which a benefit is payable under this section.  The last payment is for the month in which the spouse dies.

###### Sec. 14.25.165.   Distribution requirements.

(a) The entire interest of a member must be distributed or must begin to be distributed not later than the member's required beginning date.

(b) If a member dies after the distribution of the member's interest has begun but before the distribution has been completed, the remaining portion of the interest shall continue to be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used before the member's death.

(c) If a member has made a distribution election and dies before the distribution of the member's interest begins, distribution of the member's entire interest shall be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. However, if any portion of the member's interest is payable to a designated beneficiary, distributions may be made over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not greater than the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, commencing on or before December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, and, if the designated beneficiary is the member's surviving spouse, the date distributions are required to begin may not be earlier than the later of December 31 of the calendar year (1) immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or (2) in which the member would have attained 70 1/2 years of age, whichever is earlier. If the surviving spouse dies after the member but before payments to the spouse have begun, the provisions of this subsection apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. An amount paid to a child of the member will be treated as if it were paid to the surviving spouse if the amount becomes payable to the surviving spouse when the child reaches the age of majority.

(d) If a member has not made a distribution election before the member's death, the member's designated beneficiary must elect the method of distribution not later than December 31 of the calendar year (1) in which distributions would be required to begin under this section, or (2) that contains the fifth anniversary of the date of death of the member, whichever is earlier. If the member does not have a designated beneficiary or if the designated beneficiary does not elect a method of distribution, distribution of the member's entire interest must be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death.

(e) For purposes of (c) of this section, distribution of a member's interest is considered to begin (1) on the member's required beginning date, or (2) if the designated beneficiary is the member's surviving spouse and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before payments to the spouse have begun, on the date distribution is required to begin to the surviving spouse. If distribution in the form of an annuity irrevocably commences to the member before the required beginning date, the date distribution is considered to begin is the date that the distribution actually commences.

(f) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of AS 14.25.009§14.25.220, the requirements of this section apply to all distributions of a member's interest and take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of AS 14.25.009§14.25.220.

###### Sec. 14.25.166.   Designation of beneficiary.

(a) Each member shall designate the beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the administrator shall distribute benefits payable under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220 as a consequence of the member's death. Notwithstanding a previous designation of beneficiary, a person who is the spouse of a member at the time of the member's death automatically becomes the designated beneficiary if the spouse was married to the member during part of the member's employment for an employer

(1) except to the extent a qualified domestic relations order filed with the administrator provides for payment to a former spouse or other dependent of the member; or

(2) unless the member filed a revocation of beneficiary accompanied by a written consent to the revocation from the present spouse and each person entitled under the order; however, consent of the present spouse is not required if the member and the present spouse had been married for less than two years on the date of the member's death and if the member established when filing the revocation that the member and the present spouse were not cohabiting.

(b) Except as provided in (a) of this section, the member may change or revoke the designation without notice to the beneficiary or beneficiaries at any time.  If a member designates more than one beneficiary, each shares equally unless the member specifies a different allocation or preference.  The designation of a beneficiary, a change or revocation of a beneficiary, and a consent to revocation of a beneficiary shall be made on a form provided by the administrator and is not effective until filed with the administrator.

(c) If a member fails to designate a beneficiary, or if no designated beneficiary survives the member, the death benefit shall be paid

(1) to the surviving spouse or, if there is none surviving,

(2) to the surviving children in equal parts or, if there are none surviving,

(3) to the surviving parents in equal parts or, if there are none surviving,

(4) to the estate.

(d) A person claiming entitlement to benefits payable under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220 as a consequence of a member's death shall provide the administrator with a marriage certificate, divorce or dissolution judgment, or other evidence of entitlement. Documents establishing entitlement may be filed with the administrator immediately after a change in the member's marital status.  If the administrator does not receive notification of a claim before the date 10 days after the member's death, the person claiming entitlement is not entitled to receive from the division of retirement and benefits any benefit already paid by the administrator.

###### Sec. 14.25.167.   Joint and survivor option.

(a) Benefits payable under this section are in place of benefits payable under AS 14.25.110, 14.25.125, 14.25.155, 14.25.157, 14.25.160, 14.25.162, or 14.25.164. Upon filing an application for retirement with the administrator, or when a disabled member becomes eligible for normal retirement under AS 14.25.130(e), the member shall designate the person who is the member's spouse at the time of appointment to retirement as the contingent beneficiary. However, if the designation of the spouse is revoked under (c) of this section, the member may designate a dependent approved by the administrator as the contingent beneficiary or may take normal or early retirement under AS 14.25.110 or 14.25.125. The administrator shall pay benefits under the option elected by the member. The member may elect an option that provides that

(1) the member is entitled to receive a reduced benefit payable for life, and, after the member's death, the contingent beneficiary is entitled to receive payments in the amount of 75 percent of the reduced benefit for life;

(2) the member is entitled to receive a reduced benefit payable for life, and, after the member's death, the contingent beneficiary is entitled to receive payments in the amount of 50 percent of the reduced benefit for life; or

(3) the member is entitled to receive a reduced benefit payable during the joint lifetime of the member and the contingent beneficiary, and, after the death of either the member or the contingent beneficiary, the survivor is entitled to receive payments in the amount of 66-2/3 percent of the reduced benefit for life.

(b) The aggregate of the pension payments expected to be paid to a member and the member's contingent beneficiary under the options set out in (a) of this section shall be the actuarial equivalent of the pension that the member is otherwise entitled to receive upon retirement.

(c) A member may elect or change an option without the approval of the administrator if the member's election or change is filed in writing with the administrator before the effective date of the member's retirement. A member may revoke a joint and survivor option if the member files with the administrator before the effective date of the member's retirement a revocation and a consent to the revocation signed by the member's present spouse and each person entitled to benefits under a qualified domestic relations order on forms provided by the administrator. The administrator may waive the requirement for written consent from

(1) a person entitled under the order if the person cannot be located or for another reason established by regulation; or

(2) the spouse if

(A) the member is not married;

(B) the member was not married to the spouse during any period of the member's employment with an employer;

(C) the spouse has no rights to the option because of the terms of a qualified domestic relations order;

(D) the spouse cannot be located;

(E) the member and spouse have been married for less than two years and the member establishes that they are not cohabiting; or

(F) another reason is established under regulations of the administrator.

(d) A member, including a deferred vested member, may, regardless of age, elect a joint and survivor option any time before appointment to receive a retirement benefit.

(e) If either the member or contingent beneficiary dies before the member is appointed to retirement, the election becomes inoperative.  Once the member is appointed to retirement, the election is irrevocable, even if the retired member is reemployed.  Any additional retirement benefit to which the reemployed member may become entitled will be paid in accordance with the initial election made under this section, unless the contingent beneficiary is deceased.  If the contingent beneficiary is deceased, the benefits earned during the period of reemployment are subject to AS 14.25.110, or this section if another contingent beneficiary was designated during the period of reemployment.  All other benefits earned during previous periods of employment are subject to the election at the time the member was appointed to retirement. If death occurs during the period of reemployment and the proximate cause of death is not a bodily injury sustained or hazard undergone while in the performance and within the scope of the member's duties of employment, those benefits earned while reemployed are subject to AS 14.25.155(c).  All other benefits earned during previous periods of employment are subject to the election at the time the member was appointed to retirement.  If death occurs during the period of reemployment and the proximate cause of death is a bodily injury sustained or hazard undergone while in the performance and within the scope of the member's duties of employment and the injury or hazard is not the proximate result of wilful negligence on the part of the member, all benefits earned during all periods of employment are subject to AS 14.25.157.

(f) The member and any person claiming to be a contingent beneficiary shall file with the administrator a marriage certificate, divorce or dissolution judgment, or other evidence necessary to determine the applicability of this section and the identity of any contingent beneficiary.

(g) If the administrator determines, based on the affidavit of the member and other evidence, that a member is eligible to elect a form of payment other than a joint and survivor option under this section, and no contrary evidence is presented to the administrator within 60 days after the effective date of the member's retirement, no claim under this section, made by a spouse or former spouse of the member, may be paid if payment would result in an increase in actuarial liability to the plan.

(h) If a member fails to elect an option under (a) of this section and no effective revocation is filed with the administrator, the member is considered to have elected the option provided in (a)(2) of this section.

###### Sec. 14.25.168.   Medical benefits.

(a) Except as provided in (c) of this section, the following persons are entitled to major medical insurance coverage under this section:

(1) for teachers first hired before July 1, 1990,

(A) a teacher who is receiving a monthly benefit from the plan and who has elected coverage;

(B) the spouse and dependent children of the teacher described in (A) of this paragraph;

(C) the surviving spouse of a deceased teacher who is receiving a monthly benefit from the plan and who has elected coverage;

(D) the dependent children of a deceased teacher who are dependent on the surviving spouse described in (C) of this paragraph;

(2) for teachers first hired on or after July 1, 1990,

(A) a teacher who is receiving a monthly benefit from the plan and who has elected coverage for the teacher;

(B) the spouse of the teacher described in (A) of this paragraph if the teacher elected coverage for the spouse;

(D) the surviving spouse of a deceased teacher who is receiving a monthly benefit from the plan and who has elected coverage;

(E) the dependent children of a deceased teacher who are dependent on the surviving spouse described in (D) of this paragraph if the surviving spouse has elected coverage for the dependent children.

(b) After an election of coverage under this section, major medical insurance coverage takes effect on the same date as retirement benefits begin and stops when the member or survivor is no longer eligible to receive a monthly benefit. The coverage for persons age 65 or older is the same as that available for persons under age 65. The benefits payable to those persons age 65 or older supplement any benefits provided under the federal old age, survivors and disability insurance program. The medical premium and optional insurance premiums owed by a member or survivor shall be deducted from the benefit owed to the member or survivor before payment of the benefit.

(c) Receipt under a qualified domestic relations order of a monthly benefit from the plan does not entitle a person or the person's spouse or child to insurance coverage under (a) of this section. However, a member's former spouse who receives a monthly benefit under a qualified domestic relations order is entitled to receive major medical insurance coverage if the former spouse

(1) elects the coverage within 60 days after the first monthly benefit paid under the order is mailed first class or otherwise delivered; and

(2) pays the premium established by the administrator for the coverage.

(d) A benefit recipient may elect major medical insurance coverage in accordance with regulations and under the following conditions:

(1) a person who has less than 25 years of membership service and who is younger than 60 years of age must pay an amount equal to the full monthly group premium for retiree major medical insurance coverage;

(2) a disabled member, a disabled member who is appointed to normal retirement, a person 60 years of age or older, or a person who has at least 25 years of membership service is not required to make premium payments.

(e) The administrator shall inform members who have requested appointment to retirement that the health insurance coverage available to retired members may be different from the health insurance coverage provided to employees. The administrator shall also notify those members of time limits for selecting optional health insurance coverage and whether the election is irrevocable. A member who has requested appointment to retirement shall indicate in writing on a form provided by the administrator that the member has received the information required by this subsection and whether the member has chosen to receive optional health insurance coverage.

(f) On and after July 1, 2007, benefits under this section shall be provided in part by the Alaska retiree health care trust established under AS 39.30.097(a).

###### Sec. 14.25.169.   Duplicate benefits.

If payments from this retirement plan are due to a teacher or to the teacher's spouse under more than one provision of this plan, the teacher or spouse shall elect under which provision and which benefit the teacher or spouse wishes to receive and no payments may be made under any other provision. However, benefits under AS 14.25.155, 14.25.157, 14.25.160, 14.25.162, 14.25.164, and 14.25.167 shall be paid in addition to those benefits or that service credit a person is entitled to receive because of the person's own membership in the retirement plan.  A teacher may not receive (1) duplicate credit under this plan for the same period of service, (2) more than one year of service credit in the course of a school year, or (3) a benefit while accruing service credit under this plan, except as provided in this section.

###### Sec. 14.25.173.   Adjustments.

(a) When a change or error is made in the records maintained by the plan or in the contributions made on behalf of an employee or an error is made in computing a benefit, and, as a result, a teacher or member or beneficiary is entitled to receive from the plan more or less than the teacher or member or beneficiary would have been entitled to receive had the records or contributions been correct or had the error not been made, (1) the records, contributions, or error shall be corrected, and (2) as far as practicable, future payments or benefit entitlement shall be adjusted so that the actuarial equivalent of the pension or benefit to which the teacher or member or beneficiary was correctly entitled will be paid. An adjustment to contributions shall be picked up by the employer in accordance with AS 14.25.050 or treated as an adjustment to the employer's contributions in accordance with this section, depending upon the nature of the adjustment. If no future benefit payments are due, a person who was paid any amount to which the person was not entitled is liable for repayment of that amount, and a person who was not paid the full amount to which the person was entitled shall be paid that amount.

(b) An adjustment that requires the recovery of benefits may not be made under this section if

(1) the incorrect benefit was first paid two years or more before the member or beneficiary was notified of the error;

(2) the error was not the result of erroneous information supplied by the member or beneficiary; and

(3) the member or beneficiary did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the amount of the benefit was in error.

(c) At least quarterly, the administrator shall report to the commissioner of administration on all situations since the administrator's last report in which an adjustment has been prohibited under (b) of this section. If the commissioner of administration finds that there is reason to believe that one or more of the conditions set out in (b) of this section have not been met, the administrator shall notify the member or beneficiary that an adjustment will be made to recover the overpayment. A member or beneficiary who receives notice of adjustment under this subsection may file a request with the commissioner of administration for a waiver of the adjustment under AS 14.25.175. An adjustment that requires the repayment of benefits may not be required while the waiver request is pending.

(d) The plan shall pay interest on amounts owed to a member or beneficiary. Interest shall be charged on amounts owed to the plan by a member or beneficiary if the amount owed is the result of erroneous information supplied by the member or beneficiary, or the member or beneficiary had reasonable grounds to believe the amount of the benefit was in error. The interest paid under this subsection is at the rate established by regulation for indebtedness contributions owed. Interest accrues from the date on which the correct payment was due and continues until an actuarial adjustment to the benefit is effective or the amount owed is paid. Accrued interest for periods less than 60 days or in amounts less than the limit established in regulation for writing off small indebtedness and refund balances may not be collected or paid under this subsection.

###### Sec. 14.25.175.   Waiver of adjustments.

(a) Upon request by an affected member or beneficiary under (b) of this section, the commissioner of administration may waive an adjustment or a portion of an adjustment made under AS 14.25.173 if, in the opinion of the commissioner of administration,

(1) the adjustment or portion of the adjustment will cause undue hardship to the member or beneficiary;

(2) the adjustment was not the result of erroneous information supplied by the member or beneficiary;

(3) before the adjustment was made, the member or beneficiary received confirmation from the administrator that the member's or beneficiary's records were correct; and

(4) the member or beneficiary had no reasonable grounds to believe the records were incorrect before the adjustment was made.

(b) In order to obtain consideration of a waiver under this section, the affected member or beneficiary shall file a request with the commissioner of administration in writing within 30 days after receipt of notice that the records have been adjusted. The ruling of the commissioner of administration shall be in writing.

(c) A ruling of the commissioner of administration to deny a waiver under (b) of this section may be appealed to the office of administrative hearings.

(d) The office of administrative hearings may reverse the commissioner of administration's decision to deny a waiver and may impose conditions on granting a waiver that it considers equitable. These conditions may include requiring the member or beneficiary to make additional contributions to the plan.

###### Sec. 14.25.177.   Effect of amendments; determination of benefits upon termination.

(a) An amendment to AS 14.25.009§14.25.220 is not retroactive unless its retroactivity is expressly stated in the amendment.

(b) The monthly amount of a benefit payable under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220 shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of AS 14.25.009§14.25.220 in effect on the date of termination of the member's last segment of employment.

(a) The corpus or income of the assets held in trust as required by the plan may not be diverted to or used for other than the exclusive benefit of the members or their beneficiaries.

(b) If, upon termination of the plan, all liabilities are satisfied, any excess assets shall be deposited in the general fund, subject to the approval of the termination by the Internal Revenue Service.

(c) The administrator shall use forfeitures that arise for any reason, including from termination of employment or death, to reduce employer contributions. Forfeitures may not be applied to increase the benefits of any member.

(d) The administrator shall determine the amount of any benefit that is determined on the basis of actuarial tables using assumptions approved by the commissioner of administration. The amount of benefits is not subject to employer discretion.

(e) Employee contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the plan may not exceed the annual limits on contributions and benefits, respectively, allowed by 26 U.S.C. 415. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, the administrator may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the plan if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in 26 U.S.C. 415 by using the following methods:

(1) if the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the administrator may establish a periodic payment plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under 26 U.S.C. 415(c) or (n);

(2) if a periodic payment plan under (1) of this subsection will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by 26 U.S.C. 415(c), the administrator may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution.

(b) To the extent required by 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(37), if a member dies while performing qualified military service, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 43, the survivors of the member are entitled to any additional benefits that would have been provided to the survivors under the plan had the member resumed employment and then terminated employment on account of death. For purposes of this subsection, periods of qualified military service are not included in calculations of credited service.

(c) Consistent with and to the extent required by 26 U.S.C. 414(u)(12), a member receiving differential wage payments from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under 26 U.S.C. 415(b). For purposes of this subsection, "differential wage payment" means any payment that

(1) is made by an employer to an individual with respect to any period during which the individual is performing service in the uniformed services, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 43, while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days; and

(2) represents all or a portion of the wages the individual would have received from the employer if the individual were performing service for the employer.

(a) Except as provided in AS 29.45.030(a)(1) or in (c) of this section, member contributions and other amounts held in the plan on behalf of a member or other person who is or may become eligible for benefits under the plan are exempt from Alaska state and municipal taxes and are not subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, before they are received by the person entitled to the amount under the terms of the plan.

However, a member's right to receive benefits or the member contribution account may be assigned

(1) under a qualified domestic relations order;

###### Sec. 14.25.205.   Time limit for application.

If an application for benefits or for refund has not been filed with the administrator by July 1 following the date on which an inactive member (except a member on leave of absence without pay) would attain age 75, or if an application for benefits or for refund has not been filed with the administrator within the 50 years following the most recent date on which the person was an active member, benefits or refunds may not be paid under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220 and the member's records may be destroyed.

(1) a member meets the requirements of AS 14.25.410 and has made a complete application for payment under AS 14.25.430;

(2) a participant has elected to defer receipt of the account to a date specified, the date has been attained, and the participant has made a complete application for payment;

(3) a member attains normal retirement age and has not made an application for payment or elected to defer receipt of the account to a date later than normal retirement age;

(4) a member's beneficiary does not make an application for benefits, and five years have elapsed since the member's death;

(5) notwithstanding (1)§(4) of this subsection, a participant whose account has a balance of $1,000 or less meets the requirements of AS 14.25.410, at which time the participant must take payment of the participant's account.

(b) The entire interest of a participant must be distributed or must begin to be distributed not later than the member's required beginning date.

(c) If a member dies after the distribution of the member's interest has begun but before the distribution has been completed, the remaining portion of the interest shall continue to be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used before the member's death.

(d) If a member has made a distribution election and dies before the distribution of the member's interest begins, distribution of the member's entire interest shall be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. However, if any portion of the member's interest is payable to a designated beneficiary, distributions may be made over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not greater than the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, commencing on or before December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, and, if the designated beneficiary is the member's surviving spouse, the date distributions are required to begin may not be earlier than the later of December 31 of the calendar year (1) immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or (2) in which the member would have attained 70 1/2 years of age, whichever is earlier. If the surviving spouse dies after the member but before payments to the spouse have begun, the provisions of this subsection apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. An amount paid to a child of the member shall be treated as if it were paid to the surviving spouse if the amount becomes payable to the surviving spouse when the child reaches the age of majority.

(e) If a member has not made a distribution election before the member's death, the member's designated beneficiary must elect the method of distribution not later than December 31 of the calendar year (1) in which distributions would be required to begin under this section, or (2) that contains the fifth anniversary of the date of death of the member, whichever is earlier.

(f) For purposes of (b) of this section, distribution of a member's interest is considered to begin (1) on the member's required beginning date, or (2) if the designated beneficiary is the member's surviving spouse and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before payments to the spouse have begun, on the date distribution is required to begin to the surviving spouse. If distribution in the form of an annuity irrevocably commences to the member before the required beginning date, the date distribution is considered to begin is the date that the distribution actually commences.

(g) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of AS 14.25.310§14.25.590, the requirements of this section apply to all distributions of a member's interest and take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of AS 14.25.310§14.25.590.

(h) All distributions required under this section are determined and made in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9) and regulations adopted under that statute, including any minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement.

(i) In this section,

(1) "designated beneficiary" means the individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9) and regulations adopted under that statute;

(2) "required beginning date" means the first day of April of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the member either attains 70 1/2 years of age or actually terminates employment, whichever is later.

###### Sec. 14.25.450.   Designation of beneficiary.

(a) Each participant shall have the right to designate a beneficiary and shall have the right, at any time, to revoke the designation or to substitute another beneficiary, subject to the following limitation: if a married member elects a nonspouse beneficiary, the value of the benefit payable to the beneficiary may not exceed 50 percent of the member's portion of the account balance, and the member's spouse shall automatically be considered the beneficiary for the remaining 50 percent of the account balance, unless the spouse consents to the beneficiary designation in a writing that is notarized or witnessed by the administrator. If the spouse consents in this manner, a married member may designate a nonspouse beneficiary for the entire benefit or any portion of the benefit as part of an available form of payment contained in this plan,

(1) except to the extent a qualified domestic relations order filed with the administrator provides for payment to a former spouse or other dependent of the member; or

(2) unless the member filed a revocation of beneficiary accompanied by a written consent to the revocation from the present spouse and each person entitled under the order; however, consent of the present spouse is not required if the member and the present spouse had been married for less than one year on the date of the member's death and if the member established when filing the revocation that the member and the present spouse were not cohabiting.

(b) Except as provided in (a) of this section, the member may change or revoke the designation without notice to the beneficiary or beneficiaries at any time. If a member designates more than one beneficiary, each shares equally unless the member specifies a different allocation or preference. The designation of a beneficiary, a change or revocation of a beneficiary, and a consent to revocation of a beneficiary shall be made on a form provided by the administrator and is not effective until filed with the administrator.

(c) If a member fails to designate a beneficiary, or if no designated beneficiary survives the member, the death benefit shall be paid

(1) to the surviving spouse or, if there is none surviving;

(2) to the surviving children of the member in equal parts or, if there are none surviving;

(3) to the surviving parents in equal parts or, if there are none surviving;

(4) to the estate.

(d) A person claiming entitlement to benefits payable under AS 14.25.310§14.25.590 as a consequence of a member's death shall provide the administrator with a marriage certificate, divorce or dissolution judgment, or other evidence of entitlement. Documents establishing entitlement may be filed with the administrator immediately after a change in the member's marital status. If the administrator does not receive notification of a claim before the date 10 days after the member's death, the person claiming entitlement is not entitled to receive from the division of retirement and benefits any benefit already paid by the administrator.

###### Sec. 14.25.460.   Rights under qualified domestic relations order.

(a) Notwithstanding the nonalienation provisions in AS 14.25.500(a), the administrator may direct that benefits be paid to someone other than a member or beneficiary under a valid qualified domestic relations order that is executed by the judge of a competent court in accordance with applicable state law and that has been accepted by the administrator.

(b) The administrator shall determine whether an order meets the requirements of this section within a reasonable period after receiving an order. The administrator shall notify the member and any alternate payee that an order has been received and indicate to the member and any alternate payee when the order is accepted. A separate account for the alternate payee portion shall be established as soon as administratively feasible after the order has been accepted by the administrator.

###### Sec. 14.25.470.   Eligibility for retirement and medical benefits.

(a) In order to obtain medical benefits under AS 14.25.480, a member must retire directly from the plan. A member is eligible to retire from the plan if the member has been an active member for at least 12 months before application for retirement and

(1) the member has at least 30 years of service; or

(2) the member reaches the normal retirement age and has at least 10 years of service.

(b) The normal retirement age is the age set for Medicare eligibility at the time the member retires.

(c) A member's surviving spouse is eligible to elect medical benefits under AS 14.25.480 if the member had retired, or was eligible for retirement and medical benefits at the time of the member's death.

(d) A member shall apply for retirement and medical benefits on the forms and in the manner prescribed by the administrator.

(e) Participation in the retiree major medical insurance plan is not required in order to participate in the health reimbursement arrangement.

(f) A person eligible for retirement and medical benefits is not required to participate in the health reimbursement arrangement in order to elect participation in the retiree major medical insurance plan.

(g) An eligible person shall make the irrevocable election to participate or not participate in the retiree major medical insurance plan by reaching 70 1/2 years of age, or upon application for retirement and medical benefits, whichever is later.

###### Sec. 14.25.480.   Medical benefits.

(a) The medical benefits available to eligible persons are access to the retiree major medical insurance plan and to the health reimbursement arrangement under AS 39.30.300. Access to the retiree major medical insurance plan means that an eligible person may not be denied insurance coverage except for failure to pay the required premium.

(b) Retiree major medical insurance plan coverage elected by an eligible member under this section covers the eligible member, the spouse of the eligible member, and the dependent children of the eligible member.

(c) Retiree major medical insurance plan coverage elected by a surviving spouse of an eligible member under this section covers the surviving spouse and the dependent children of the eligible member who are dependent on the surviving spouse.

(d) Major medical insurance coverage takes effect on the first day of the month following the date of the administrator's approval of the election and stops when the person who elects coverage dies or fails to make a required premium payment.

(e) The coverage for persons 65 years of age or older is the same as that available for persons under 65 years of age. The benefits payable to those persons 65 years of age or older supplement any benefits provided under the federal old age, survivors and disability insurance program.

(f) The medical and optional insurance premiums owed by the person who elects coverage may be deducted from the health reimbursement arrangement. If the amount of the health reimbursement arrangement becomes insufficient to pay the premiums, the person who elects coverage under (a) of this section shall pay the premiums directly.

(g) The cost of premiums for retiree major medical insurance coverage for an eligible member or surviving spouse who is

(1) not eligible for Medicare is an amount equal to the full monthly group premiums for retiree major medical insurance coverage;

(2) eligible for Medicare is the following percentage of the premium amounts established for retirees who are eligible for Medicare:

(A) 30 percent if the member had 10 or more, but less than 15, years of service;

(B) 25 percent if the member had 15 or more, but less than 20, years of service;

(C) 20 percent if the member had 20 or more, but less than 25, years of service;

(D) 15 percent if the member had 25 or more, but less than 30, years of service;

(E) 10 percent if the member had 30 or more years of service.

(h) The eligibility for retiree major medical insurance coverage for an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order shall be determined based on the eligibility of the member to elect coverage. The alternate payee shall pay the full monthly premium for retiree major medical insurance coverage.

(i) A person who is entitled to retiree major medical insurance coverage shall

(1) be informed by the administrator in writing

(A) that the health insurance coverage available to retired members may be different from the health insurance coverage provided to employees;

(B) of time limits for selecting optional health insurance coverage and whether the election is irrevocable; and

(2) indicate in writing on a form provided by the administrator that the person has received the information required by this subsection and whether the person has chosen to receive optional health insurance coverage.

(j) The monthly group premiums for retiree major medical insurance coverage are established by the administrator in accordance with AS 39.30.095. Nothing in AS 14.25.310§14.25.590 guarantees a person who elects coverage under (a) of this section a monthly group premium rate for retiree major medical insurance coverage other than the premium in effect for the month in which the premium is due for coverage for that month.

(k) In this section, "health reimbursement arrangement" means the plan established in AS 39.30.300.

###### Sec. 14.25.485.   Occupational disability benefits and reemployment of disabled members.

(a) A member is eligible for an occupational disability benefit if employment is terminated because of a total and apparently permanent occupational disability before the member's normal retirement date.

(b) The occupational disability benefits accrue beginning the first day of the month following termination of employment as a result of the disability and are payable the last day of the month. If a final determination granting the benefit is not made in time to pay the benefit when due, a retroactive payment shall be made to cover the period of deferment. The last payment shall be for the first month in which the disabled member

(1) dies;

(2) recovers from the disability;

(3) fails to meet the requirements under (f), (h), or (k) of this section; or

(4) reaches normal retirement age.

(c) If the disabled member becomes ineligible to receive occupational disability benefits before the normal retirement date, the disabled member shall then be entitled to receive retirement benefits if the member would have been eligible for the benefit had employment continued during the period of disability. The period of disability constitutes membership service in regard to determining eligibility for retirement.

(d) The monthly amount of an occupational disability benefit is 40 percent of the disabled member's gross monthly compensation at the time of termination due to disability. Notwithstanding AS 14.25.390(b), at the time a member is appointed to disability, the member becomes fully vested in the employer contributions made under AS 14.25.350(a). A disabled member is fully vested in the contributions to the member's individual account made under this subsection. A member is not entitled to elect distributions from the member's individual contribution account under AS 14.25.410 while the member is receiving disability benefits under this section. While a member is receiving disability benefits, based on the disabled member's gross monthly compensation at the time of termination due to disability, the employer shall make contributions to the

(1) member's individual account under AS 14.25.340 on behalf of the member, without deduction from the member's disability payments; and

(2) appropriate accounts and funds on behalf of the member under AS 14.25.350.

(e) A member is not entitled to an occupational disability benefit unless the member files an application for an occupational disability benefit with the administrator within 90 days after the date of terminating employment. If the member is unable to meet a filing requirement of this subsection, the filing requirement may be waived by the administrator if there are extraordinary circumstances that resulted in the member's inability to meet the filing requirement.

(f) A disabled member receiving an occupational disability benefit shall undergo a medical examination as often as the administrator considers advisable, but not more frequently than once each year. The administrator shall determine the place of the examination and engage the physician or physicians. If, in the judgment of the administrator, the examination indicates that the disabled member is no longer incapacitated because of a total and apparently permanent occupational disability, the administrator may not issue further disability benefits to the member.

(g) A disabled member's occupational disability benefit terminates the last day of the month in which the disabled member first qualifies for normal retirement. At that time, the member's retirement benefit shall be determined under the provisions of AS 14.25.420§14.25.440, 14.25.470, and 14.25.480. A member whose occupational disability benefit terminates under this subsection shall be considered to have retired directly from the plan.

(h) A member appointed to disability benefits shall apply to the division of vocational rehabilitation of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development within 30 days after the date disability benefits commence. The member shall be enrolled in a rehabilitation program if the member meets the eligibility requirements of the division of vocational rehabilitation. Unless the member demonstrates cause, benefits shall terminate at the end of the first month in which a disabled member

(1) fails to report to the division of vocational rehabilitation;

(2) is certified by the division of vocational rehabilitation as failing to cooperate in a vocational rehabilitation program;

(3) fails to interview for a job; or

(4) fails to accept a position offered.

(i) Upon the death of a disabled member who is receiving or is entitled to receive an occupational disability benefit, the administrator shall pay the surviving spouse a surviving spouse's pension, equal to 40 percent of the member's monthly compensation at the time of termination of employment because of occupational disability. If there is no surviving spouse, the administrator shall pay the survivor's pension in equal parts to the dependent children of the member. While the monthly survivor's pension is being paid, the survivor is not entitled to elect distributions from the member's individual contribution account under AS 14.25.410. The first payment of the surviving spouse's pension or of a dependent child's pension shall accrue from the first day of the month following the member's death and is payable the last day of the month. The last payment shall be made the last day of the last month in which there is an eligible surviving spouse or dependent child, or the last day of the month in which the member would have first qualified for normal retirement if the member had survived, whichever day is sooner. A retirement benefit shall be determined under the provisions of AS 14.25.420§14.25.440, 14.25.470, and 14.25.480 based on the date the member would have first qualified for normal retirement if the member had survived. In addition to the payment of the member's individual account, the surviving spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, the surviving dependent children of the member, shall receive an additional benefit in an amount equal to the accumulated contributions that would have been made to the deceased member's individual account under AS 14.25.340(a) and 14.25.350(a), based on the deceased member's gross monthly compensation at the time of occupational disability, from the time of the member's death to the date the member would have first qualified for normal retirement if the member had survived. Earnings shall be allocated to the additional benefit calculated under this subsection based on the actual rate of return, net of expenses, of the trust account established under AS 14.25.350(e) over the period that the contributions would have been made. This additional amount and allocated earnings shall be paid in the same manner as determined for the member's individual account under AS 14.25.420§14.25.460 to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Service. For the purpose of determining eligibility of a survivor who is receiving a benefit under this subsection for medical benefits under AS 14.25.470 and 14.25.480, a member who died while receiving disability benefits shall be considered to have retired directly from the plan on the date the member would have first qualified for normal retirement if the member had survived. The period during which the member was eligible for a disability benefit and the period during which a survivor's pension is paid to a survivor under this subsection each constitute membership service for the purposes of determining eligibility for medical benefits under AS 14.25.310§14.25.590 and AS 39.30.300§39.30.495.

(j) While a survivor under (i) of this section is receiving a survivor's pension, the employer of the deceased member shall make contributions with respect to the survivor based on the deceased member's gross monthly compensation at the time of termination due to disability

(1) that would have been paid to the member's individual account under AS 14.25.340 and 14.25.350(a) to the trust account established under AS 14.25.350(e), without deduction from the survivor's pension; and

(2) to the appropriate accounts and funds under AS 14.25.350(b)§(e).

(k) In this section, "occupational disability" means a physical or mental condition that the administrator determines presumably permanently prevents an employee from satisfactorily performing the employee's usual duties or the duties of another comparable position or job available to the employee and for which the employee is qualified by training or education; however, the proximate cause of the condition must be a bodily injury sustained, or a hazard undergone, while in the performance and within the scope of the employee's duties and not the proximate result of the wilful negligence of the employee.

###### Sec. 14.25.486.   Disability benefit adjustment.

(a) Once each year, the administrator shall increase disability benefits. The amount of the increase is a percentage of the current disability benefit equal to the lesser of 75 percent of the increase in the cost of living in the preceding calendar year or nine percent.

(b) If a disabled member was not receiving a benefit during the entire preceding calendar year, the increase in the benefit under this section shall be adjusted by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months for which the benefit was received in the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which is 12.

(c) An increase in benefit payments under this section is effective July 1 of each year and is based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers for Anchorage, Alaska, during the previous calendar year, as determined by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

(d) Benefit adjustments under this section shall terminate the last day of the month following the date on which a disabled member is no longer receiving a disability benefit under AS 14.25.485.

###### Sec. 14.25.487.   Occupational death benefit.

(a) If (1) the death of a member occurs before the member's retirement and before the member's normal retirement date, (2) the proximate cause of death is a bodily injury sustained or a hazard undergone while in the performance and within the scope of the member's duties, and (3) the injury or hazard is not the proximate result of wilful negligence of the member, a monthly survivor's pension shall be paid to the surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse or if the spouse later dies, the monthly survivor's pension shall be paid in equal parts to the dependent children of the member.

(b) The first payment of the surviving spouse's pension or of a dependent child's pension shall be made for the month following the month in which the member dies. Payments shall cease on the last day of the month in which there is no longer an eligible spouse or eligible dependent child, or the last day of the month following the earliest date the member would have first qualified for normal retirement if the member had survived, whichever day is sooner.

(c) The monthly survivor's pension in (b) of this section for survivors of members is 40 percent of the member's monthly compensation in the month in which the member dies. While the monthly survivor's pension is being paid, the survivor is not entitled to elect distributions from the member's individual contribution account under AS 14.25.410, except as required by AS 14.25.440. While the monthly survivor's pension is being paid, the employer shall make contributions with respect to the member's surviving spouse and member's surviving dependent children based on the deceased member's gross monthly compensation at the time of occupational death

(1) that would have been paid to the member's individual account under AS 14.25.340 and 14.25.350(a), to the trust account established under AS 14.25.350(e), without deduction from the survivor's pension; and

(2) to the appropriate accounts and funds under AS 14.25.350(b)§(e).

(d) If a member's death is caused by an act of assault, assassination, or terrorism directly related to the person's status as a member, whether the act occurs on or off the member's job site, the death shall be considered to have occurred in the performance of and within the scope of the member's duties for purposes of (a)(2) of this section. If the expressed or apparent motive and intent of the perpetrator of the harm inflicted upon the member was due to the performance of the member's job duties or employment, the death shall be considered to be directly related to the member's status as a member. A member's job duties are those performed within the course and scope of the person's employment with an employer.

(e) On the date the member would have first qualified for normal retirement if the member had survived, the retirement benefit shall be determined under the provisions of AS 14.25.420§14.25.440, 14.25.470, and 14.25.480. In addition to payment of the member's individual account, the surviving spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, the surviving dependent children of the member, shall receive an additional benefit in an amount equal to the accumulated contributions that would have been made to the deceased member's individual account under AS 14.25.340(a) and 14.25.350(a), based on the deceased member's gross monthly compensation at the time of the member's occupational death, from the time of the member's death to the date the member would have first qualified for normal retirement if the member had survived. Earnings shall be allocated to the additional benefit calculated under this subsection based on the actual rate of return, net of expenses, of the trust account established under AS 14.25.350(e) over the period that the contributions would have been made. This additional amount and allocated earnings shall be paid in the same manner as determined for the member's individual account under AS 14.25.420§14.25.460 to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Service. A member who died and whose survivors receive occupational death benefits under this section shall be considered to have retired directly from the plan on the date the member would have first qualified for normal retirement if the member had survived. The period during which a survivor's pension is paid under this subsection constitutes membership service for the purposes of determining vesting in employer contributions under AS 14.25.390(b) and eligibility for medical benefits under AS 14.25.310§14.25.590 and AS 39.30.300§39.30.495.

###### Sec. 14.25.488.   Survivors' pension adjustment.

(a) Once each year, the administrator shall increase payments to a person 60 years of age or older receiving a survivor's pension under AS 14.25.485(i) or 14.25.487(c) and to a person who has received a survivor's pension under AS 14.25.485(i) or 14.25.487(c) for at least eight years, who is not otherwise eligible for an increase under this section.

(b) The amount of the increase is a percentage of the current survivor's pension equal to the lesser of 50 percent of the increase in the cost of living in the preceding calendar year or six percent.

(c) If a survivor was not receiving a pension during the entire preceding calendar year, the increase in the survivor's pension under this section shall be adjusted by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months for which the pension was received in the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which is 12.

(d) The administrator shall increase the initial survivor's pension paid to a survivor of a member who died while receiving disability benefits by a percentage equal to the total cumulative percentage that has been applied to the member's disability benefit under AS 14.25.486.

(e) An increase in benefit payments under this section is effective July 1 of each year and is based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers for Anchorage, Alaska, during the previous calendar year, as determined by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

(f) Pension adjustments under this section shall terminate the last day of the month following the date on which a survivor is no longer receiving a survivor's pension under AS 14.25.485(i) or 14.25.487(c).

###### Sec. 14.25.489.   Premiums for retiree major medical insurance coverage upon termination of disability benefits or survivor's pension.

The premium for retiree major medical insurance coverage payable by a member whose disability benefit is terminated under AS 14.25.485(g) or by an eligible survivor whose survivor pension is terminated under AS 14.25.485(i) or 14.25.487(e) when the member would have been eligible for normal retirement if the member had survived shall be determined under AS 14.25.480(g)(2) as if the member or survivor were eligible for Medicare.

###### Sec. 14.25.490.   Amendment and termination of plan.

(a) The state has the right to amend the plan at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, including the right to make retroactive amendments referred to in 26 U.S.C. 401(b).

(b) The plan administrator may not modify or amend the plan retroactively in such a manner as to reduce the benefits of any member accrued to date under the plan by reason of contributions made before the modification or amendment except to the extent that the reduction is permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.

(c) The state may, in its discretion, terminate the plan in whole or part at any time without liability for the termination. If the plan is terminated, all investments remain in force until all individual accounts have been completely distributed under the plan, and, after all plan liabilities are satisfied, excess assets revert to the employer.

(d) Any contribution made by an employer to the plan because of a mistake of fact must be returned to the employer by the administrator within one year after the contribution or discovery, whichever is later.

###### Sec. 14.25.500.   Exclusive benefit.

(a) The corpus or income of the assets held in trust as required by the plan may not be diverted or used for other than the exclusive benefit of the participants.

(b) If plan benefits are provided through the distribution of annuity or insurance contracts, any refunds or credits in excess of plan benefits due to dividends, earnings, or other experience rating credits, or surrender or cancellation credits, shall be paid to the trust fund.

(c) The assets of the plan may not be used to pay premiums or contributions of the employer under another plan maintained by the employer.

(d) The administrator shall use forfeitures in the fixed benefit account of the plan that arise for any reason, including from termination of employment or death, to reduce employer contributions. Forfeitures may not be applied to increase the benefits of any member.

(e) The administrator shall determine the amount of any fixed benefit that is determined on the basis of actuarial tables using assumptions approved by the commissioner. The amount of benefits is not subject to employer discretion.

###### Sec. 14.25.510.   Nonguarantee of returns, rates, or benefit amounts.

The plan created by AS 14.25.310§14.25.590 is, with respect to individual accounts, treated as a defined contribution plan, and not a defined benefit plan. The amount of money in the individual account of a participant depends on the amount of contributions and the rate of return from investments of the account that varies over time. If benefits are paid in the form of an annuity, the benefit amount payable is dependent on the amount of money in the account and the interest rates applied and service fees charged by the annuity payor at the time the annuity is purchased from the carrier and benefits are first paid. Nothing in this plan guarantees a participant

(1) a rate of return or interest rate other than that actually earned by the account of the participant, less applicable administrative expenses; or

(2) an annuity based on interest rates or service charges other than interest rates available from and service charges by the annuity payor in effect at the time the annuity is paid.

###### Sec. 14.25.520.   Nonguarantee of employment.

The provisions of AS 14.25.310§14.25.590 are not a contract of employment between an employer and an employee, nor do they confer a right of an employee to be continued in the employment of an employer, nor are they a limitation of the right of an employer to discharge an employee with or without cause.

###### Sec. 14.25.530.   Fraud.

(a) A person who knowingly makes a false statement or falsifies or permits to be falsified a record of this plan in an attempt to defraud the plan is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.

(b) In this section, "knowingly" has the meaning given in AS 11.81.900(a).

###### Sec. 14.25.532.   Pension forfeiture.

The provisions of AS 37.10.310 apply to pension benefits under AS 14.25.310§14.25.590.

###### Sec. 14.25.540.   Transfer into defined contribution retirement plan by nonvested members of defined benefit retirement plan.

(a) Subject to (i) of this section, an active member of the defined benefit retirement plan of the teachers' retirement system is eligible to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan established under AS 14.25.310§14.25.590 if that member has not vested. Participation in the defined contribution retirement plan is in lieu of participation in the defined benefit retirement plan established under AS 14.25.009§14.25.220.

(b) A member who has vested in a defined benefit retirement plan is not eligible to transfer under this section.

(c) Each eligible member who elects to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan shall have transferred to a new account the member contribution account balance held in trust for the member under the defined benefit retirement plan of the teachers' retirement system. A matching employer contribution shall be made on behalf of that employee to the new account. The employer shall make the matching contribution from funds other than the trust funds of the defined benefit retirement plan. The amount of the matching employer contribution is subject to, and may not exceed, the limitation of 26 U.S.C. 415(c) during the applicable limitation year as defined in AS 14.25.590. If the matching employer contribution would exceed the limits during the limitation year in which the transfer occurs, the remaining amount of the matching employer contribution shall be made in the next limitation year, if the limits would not be exceeded.

(d) Upon a transfer, all membership service previously earned under the defined benefit retirement plan shall be nullified for purposes of entitlement to a future benefit under the defined benefit retirement plan but shall be credited for purposes of determining vesting in employer contributions under AS 14.25.390(b) and eligibility to elect medical benefits under AS 14.25.470. Membership service allowed for credit toward medical benefits does not include any service credit purchased under AS 14.25.075 for employment by an employer who is not a participating employer in this chapter.

(e) An eligible member whose accounts are subject to a qualified domestic relations order may not make an election to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan under this subsection unless the qualified domestic relations order is amended or vacated and court-certified copies of the order are received by the administrator.

(f) As directed by the participant, the board shall transfer or cause to be transferred the appropriate amounts to the designated account. The board shall establish transfer procedures by regulation, but the actual transfer may not be later than 30 days after the effective date of the member's participation in the defined contribution retirement plan unless the major financial markets for securities available for a transfer are seriously disrupted by an unforeseen event that also causes the suspension of trading on any national securities exchange in the country where the securities were issued. In that event, the 30-day period of time may be extended by a resolution of the board of trustees.

A capital reserve fund may be established only if the board determines that the establishment of the fund would enhance the marketability of the bonds. Money in a capital reserve fund, except as provided in this section, may be used as required only for the (1) payment of the principal of, and interest on, bonds or of the sinking fund payments with respect to those bonds; (2) purchase or redemption of the bonds; or (3) payment of a redemption premium required to be paid when the bonds are redeemed before maturity. However, money in a capital reserve fund may not be withdrawn if the withdrawal would reduce the amount in the capital reserve fund to less than the capital reserve fund requirement, except for the purpose of making payment, when due, of principal, interest, or redemption premiums on the bonds when other money of the corporation is not available for the payments. Income or interest earned by, or increment to, a capital reserve fund, from the investment of all or part of the fund, may be transferred by the corporation to other funds or accounts of the corporation if the transfer does not reduce the amount of the capital reserve fund below the capital reserve fund requirement.

(b) If the board decides to issue bonds secured by a capital reserve fund, the bonds may not be issued if the amount in the capital reserve fund is less than the capital reserve fund requirement, unless the corporation, at the time of issuance of the bonds, pledges to deposit in the capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the bonds to be issued or from other sources, an amount that, together with the amount then in the fund, is not less than the capital reserve fund requirement.

(c) In computing the amount of a capital reserve fund for the purpose of this section, securities in which all or a portion of the fund is invested and credit facilities deposited in or credited to a capital reserve fund under (f) of this section shall be valued by a reasonable method established by the board by resolution or by trust indenture. Valuation shall include the amount of interest earned or accrued as of the date of valuation.

(d) By January 15 of each year, the chairman of the board shall certify in writing to the governor and the legislature the amount, if any, required to restore a capital reserve fund to the capital reserve fund requirement. The legislature may appropriate to the corporation the amount certified by the chairman. The corporation shall deposit the amounts appropriated under this subsection during a fiscal year in the proper capital reserve fund. This subsection does not create a debt or liability of the state.

(e) The board may establish reserve funds, other than capital reserve funds, to secure one or more issues of bonds of the corporation. The corporation may deposit in a reserve fund established under this subsection the proceeds of sale of its bonds and other money available from any other source. The corporation may allow a reserve fund established under this subsection to be depleted without complying with (d) of this section.

Neither the resolution, trust agreement, nor other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded or filed under the provisions of AS 45.01§AS 45.08, AS 45.12, AS 45.14, and AS 45.29 (Uniform Commercial Code) to be valid, perfected, binding, or effective.

###### Sec. 14.42.260.   Nonliability on bonds.

(a) The members of the board and individuals executing the bonds of the corporation are not liable personally on the bonds or subject to personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of the bonds.

(b) The bonds issued by the corporation do not constitute an indebtedness or other liability of the state or of a political subdivision of the state, except the corporation, but shall be payable solely from the income and receipts or other funds or property of the corporation. The corporation may not pledge the faith or credit of the state, or of a political subdivision of the state, except the corporation, to the payment of a bond. Issuance of a bond by the corporation does not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the state or a political subdivision of the state to apply money from, or levy or pledge any form of taxation whatever to the payment of the bond.

###### Sec. 14.42.265.   Underwriters.

The board may select one or more underwriters for its bonds in accordance with procedures

If the person is delinquent or in default on the person's regular repayment schedule, repayment shall continue until the person is current in payments. A period of time during which the person is making past due payments may not be considered as a qualifying period for the purpose of calculating forgiveness benefits.

#### Article 10. Teacher Education Loan Program.

###### Sec. 14.43.600.   Findings and intent.

(a) The legislature finds that there is a wide and unacceptable disparity between the distribution of Native teachers and Native students in rural elementary and secondary schools in the state.  Many rural schools have virtually no Native teachers and no non-Native students. The undesirable effects of this disparity include the following:

(1) there is a serious weakness in the ability of teaching staffs in rural schools to foster a sense of Native traditions and cultures in the Native students;

(2) many rural students are forced to exist in two entirely separate situations: the essentially traditional atmosphere of many Native homes, and the essentially modern atmosphere of the classroom;

(3) almost no Native students return to rural schools to teach, continuing the imbalance and exacerbating its effects; and

(4) there is an annual turnover of 40 percent among teachers in regional educational attendance areas in the state.

(b) The legislature further finds that existing programs have failed to increase the proportion of Natives teaching in rural schools.  Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to establish the teacher education loan program to encourage rural high school graduates to return to rural schools as teachers and relieve the conditions described in this section.

###### Sec. 14.43.610.   Program established.

There is established the teacher education loan program to provide an incentive for rural high school graduates to pursue teaching careers in rural elementary and secondary schools in the state.

The terms and provisions of the Compact referred to in AS 14.44.010 are as follows:

WESTERN REGIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION COMPACT

Whereas, the future of this Nation and of the Western States is dependent upon the quality of the education of its youth; and

Whereas, many of the Western States individually do not have sufficient numbers of potential students to warrant the establishment and maintenance within their borders of adequate facilities in all of the essential fields of technical, professional, and graduate training, nor all of the States have the financial ability to furnish within their borders institutions capable of providing acceptable standards of training in all of the fields mentioned above; and

Whereas, it is believed that the Western States, or groups of such states within the Region, cooperatively can provide acceptable and efficient educational facilities to meet the needs of the Region and of the students thereof:

Now, therefore, the States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, and the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii do hereby covenant and agree as follows:

Each of the compacting states and territories pledge to each of the other compacting states and territories faithful cooperation in carrying out all the purposes of this Compact.

The compacting states and territories hereby create the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, hereinafter called the Commission. Said Commission shall be a body corporate of each compacting state and territory and an agency thereof. The Commission shall have all the powers and duties set forth herein, including the power to sue and to be sued, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states and territories.

The Commission shall consist of three resident members from each compacting state or territory. At all times one Commissioner from each compacting state or territory shall be an educator engaged in the field of higher education in the state or territory from which the commissioner is appointed.

The Commissioners from each state and territory shall be appointed by the Governor thereof as provided by law in such state or territory. Any Commissioner may be removed or suspended from office as provided by the law of the state or territory from which the commissioner shall have been appointed.

The terms of each Commissioner shall be four years; provided however, that the first three Commissioners shall be appointed as follows; one for two years, one for three years, and one for four years. Each Commissioner shall hold office until a successor shall be appointed and qualified. If any office becomes vacant for any reason, the Governor shall appoint a Commissioner to fill the office for the remainder of the unexpired term.

Any business transacted at any meeting of the Commission must be by affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of compacting states and territories.

One or more Commissioners from a majority of the compacting states and territories shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

Each compacting state and territory represented at any meeting of the Commission is entitled to one vote.

The Commission shall elect from its number a chairman and a vice chairman, and may appoint, and at its pleasure dismiss or remove, such officers, agents, and employees as may be required to carry out the purpose of this Compact; and shall fix and determine their duties, qualifications and compensation, having due regard for the importance of the responsibilities involved.

The Commissioners shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses from the funds of the Commission.

The Commission shall adopt a seal and bylaws and shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations for its management and control.

The Commission may elect such committees as it deems necessary for the carrying out of its functions.

The Commission shall establish and maintain an office within one of the compacting states for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time, but in any event must meet at least once a year. The Chairman may call such additional meetings and upon the request of a majority of the Commissioners of three or more compacting states or territories shall call additional meetings.

The Commission shall submit a budget to the Governor of each compacting state and territory at such time and for such period as may be required.

The Commission shall, after negotiations with interested institutions, determine the cost of providing the facilities for graduate and professional education for use in its contractual agreements throughout the Region.

On or before the fifteenth day of January of each year, the Commission shall submit to the Governors and Legislatures of the compacting states and territories a report of its activities for the preceding calendar year.

The Commission shall keep accurate books of account, showing in full its receipts and disbursements, and said books of account shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by the Governor of any compacting state or territory or designated representatives of the Governor. The Commission shall not be subject to the audit and accounting procedure of any of the compacting states or territories. The Commission shall provide for an independent annual audit.

It shall be the duty of the Commission to enter into such contractual agreements with any institutions in the Region offering graduate or professional education and with any of the compacting states or territories as may be required in the judgment of the Commission to provide adequate services and facilities of graduate and professional education for the citizens of the respective compacting states or territories. The Commission shall first endeavor to provide adequate services and facilities in the fields of dentistry, medicine, public health, and veterinary medicine, and may undertake similar activities in other professional and graduate fields.

For this purpose the Commission may enter into contractual agreements "

(a) with the governing authority of any educational institution in the Region, or with any compacting state or territory, to provide such graduate or professional educational services upon terms and conditions to be agreed upon between contracting parties, and

(b) with the governing authority of any educational institution in the Region or with any compacting state or territory to assist in the placement of graduate or professional students in educational institutions in the Region providing the desired services and facilities, upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe.

It shall be the duty of the Commission to undertake studies of needs for professional and graduate educational facilities in the Region, the resources for meeting such needs, and the long-range effects of the Compact on higher education; and from time to time prepare comprehensive reports on such research for presentation to the Western Governors' Conference and to the legislatures of the compacting states and territories.  In conducting such studies, the Commission may confer with any national or regional planning body which may be established. The Commission shall draft and recommend to the Governors of the various compacting states and territories, uniform legislation dealing with problems of higher education in the Region.

For the purposes of this Compact the word "Region" shall be construed to mean the geographical limits of the several compacting states and territories.

The operating costs of the Commission shall be apportioned equally among the compacting states and territories.

This Compact shall become operative and binding immediately as to those states and territories adopting it whenever five or more of the states or territories of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii have duly adopted it prior to July 1, 1955. This Compact shall become effective as to any additional states or territories adopting thereafter at the time of such adoption.

This Compact may be terminated at any time by consent of a majority of the compacting states or territories. Consent shall be manifested by passage and signature in the usual manner of legislation expressing such consent by the legislature and Governor of such terminating state. Any state or territory may at any time withdraw from this Compact by means of appropriate legislation to that end. Such withdrawal shall not become effective until two years after written notice thereof by the Governor of the withdrawing state or territory accompanied by a certified copy of the requisite legislative action is received by the Commission. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state or territory from its obligations hereunder accruing prior to the effective date of withdrawal. The withdrawing state or territory may rescind its action of withdrawal at any time within the two-year period. Thereafter, the withdrawing state or territory may be reinstated by application to and the approval by a majority vote of the Commission.

If any compacting state or territory shall at any time default in the performance of any of its obligations assumed or imposed in accordance with the provisions of this Compact, all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact or agreements hereunder, shall be suspended from the effective date of such default as fixed by the Commission.

Unless such default shall be remedied within a period of two years following the effective date of such default, this Compact may be terminated with respect to such defaulting state or territory by affirmative vote of three-fourths of the other member states or territories.

Any such defaulting state may be reinstated by:

(a) performing all acts and obligations upon which it has heretofore defaulted, and (b) application to and the approval by a majority vote of the Commission.

(a) The Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education is authorized to act on behalf of this state in making arrangements for the placement of students in institutions and programs of higher learning outside the states which are parties to the Compact for establishing the Commission. For that purpose, the Commission may negotiate and enter into arrangements and contracts with this state or any appropriate agency of it, with public and private educational institutions and agencies, and with states and other governmental entities. These arrangements and contracts may provide for the obtaining of one or more places for students on either a special or continuing basis; the payment of partial or full tuition and other charges; and the furnishing of reciprocal, compensating or other advantages and benefits in support of the educational program involved.

(b) The authority conferred by (a) of this article shall be exercised only pursuant to written agreement between the Commission and an agency of this state having responsibility for or duties with respect to programs for assisting residents of this state to obtain higher education. Any such agreements shall include provisions for the payment of tuition and any other costs, and no such agreement shall be made which commits this state or any agency or officer of it to any obligation for which funds have not been appropriated or otherwise made available in accordance with law.

(c) Nothing contained in this article alters any of the obligations or restricts or impairs any rights which this state may have under the Compact establishing the Commission.

The amount of the surety bond shall be reexamined by the commission upon each renewal of the authorization to operate to determine if a larger or smaller bond would be appropriate to ensure adequate protection for the students or enrollees, or their parents or guardians, or classes thereof.  The bond shall be executed by the applicant as principal and by a surety company qualified and authorized to do business in this state and shall be conditioned to provide indemnification to any student or enrollee, or the student's or enrollee's parent or guardian, or class thereof, determined to have suffered loss or damage as a result of an act or practice which is a violation of this chapter by the postsecondary educational institution and that the bonding company shall pay a final nonappealable order of the commission or judgment of a court of this state having jurisdiction, upon receipt of written notification of the order or judgment.

(c) The surety bond to be filed under this section shall cover the period of the authorization to operate or the agent's permit, as appropriate, except when a surety is released as provided in this subsection.  A surety on a bond filed under this section may be released from that bond after the surety serves written notice of the release to the commission and to the bonded agent or institution 45 days before the release. However, the release does not discharge or otherwise affect a claim filed by a student or enrollee, or a parent or guardian, or class thereof, before or after the release for loss or damage resulting from an act or practice which is a violation of this chapter alleged to have occurred while the bond was in effect or for an institution's ceasing operations during the term for which tuition has been paid while the bond was in force.

(d) Authorization for an institution to operate and an agent's permit shall be suspended by operation of law when the institution or agent is no longer covered by a surety bond as required by this section. However, the commission shall give the institution or agent, or both, at least 30 days written notice before the release of the surety, to the effect that the authorization or permit shall be suspended by operation of law until another surety bond is filed in the same manner as, and in a like amount to, the bond being terminated.

(a) If a person to whom educational services are to be furnished by a postsecondary educational institution is a resident of this state at the time a contract relating to payment for the services, or a note, instrument, or other evidence of indebtedness relating to the services, is entered into, the provisions of this section govern the rights of the parties to the contract or evidence of indebtedness.

If the lending agency fails to do so, it is liable for loss or damage suffered by a subsequent assignee, transferee, or holder of the evidence of indebtedness because of the absence of the notation.  Notwithstanding the presence or absence of the notation, and notwithstanding an agreement to the contrary, the lending agency making the loan or extending the credit, and a transferee, assignee, or holder of the evidence of indebtedness is subject to all defenses and claims that could be asserted against the postsecondary educational institution that was to render the services or facilities, by any party to the evidence of indebtedness or by the person to whom the services or facilities were to be rendered, up to the amount remaining to be paid.

(B) is a contagious but also largely preventable infection of the spinal cord fluid and the fluid surrounding the brain;

(2) scientific evidence suggests that college students living in campus housing are at a moderately increased risk of contracting meningococcal disease; and

It is not necessary that the commission allege or prove that it has no adequate remedy at law. The right of injunction provided in this section is in addition to other legal remedies available to the commission and is in addition to the right of criminal prosecution.  However, the commission may not obtain a temporary restraining order without notice to the person affected.

The amount of a basic grant must be equally matched by local money, the fair value of volunteer labor, or a combination of local money and volunteer labor. If the amount available for public library assistance grants during a fiscal year is not sufficient to fully fund basic grants for all eligible libraries, the amount available shall be prorated so that the amount of basic grants for all eligible libraries is reduced by the same percentage.
