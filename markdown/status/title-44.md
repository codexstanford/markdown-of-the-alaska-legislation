(c) An agency that issues a notice under this section shall ensure that the notice is prepared in a form adequate for posting on the Alaska Online Public Notice System. Unless the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a regulation is proposed by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska, the Board of Fisheries, the Board of Game, or the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, a complete copy of each proposed adoption, amendment, or repeal of a regulation and, if feasible and not prohibited by copyright, any document or other material incorporated by reference, including any document or other material incorporated by reference under this section, in the proposed adoption or amendment shall be made available on the Alaska Online Public Notice System by providing an electronic attachment or link to the complete text.

Unless the right to petition for adoption of a regulation is restricted by statute to a designated group or the procedure for the petition is prescribed by statute, an interested person may petition an agency for the adoption or repeal of a regulation as provided in AS 44.62.180§44.62.290.  The petition must state clearly and concisely

(1) the substance or nature of the regulation, amendment, or repeal requested;

(2) the reasons for the request;

###### Sec. 44.62.230.   Procedure on petition.

Upon receipt of a petition requesting the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a regulation under AS 44.62.180§44.62.290, a state agency shall, within 30 days, deny the petition in writing or schedule the matter for public hearing under AS 44.62.190§44.62.215. However, if the petition is for an emergency regulation, and the agency finds that an emergency exists, the requirements of AS 44.62.040(c) and 44.62.190§44.62.215 do not apply, and the agency may submit the regulation to the lieutenant governor immediately after making the finding of emergency and putting the regulation into proper form.

###### Sec. 44.62.240.   Limitation on retroactive action.

If a regulation adopted by an agency under this chapter is primarily legislative, the regulation has prospective effect only.  A regulation adopted under this chapter that is primarily an "interpretative regulation" has retroactive effect only if the agency adopting it has adopted no earlier inconsistent regulation and has followed no earlier course of conduct inconsistent with the regulation.  Silence or failure to follow any course of conduct is considered earlier inconsistent conduct.

###### Sec. 44.62.245.   Material incorporated by reference.

(a) In adopting a regulation that incorporates a document or other material by reference, a state agency may incorporate future amended versions of the document or other material if the adopted regulation identifies or refers to the document or other material followed by the phrase "as may be amended," the phrase "as amended from time to time," or a similar provision and the

(1) document consists of a regulation of another agency of the state; or

(2) incorporation of a future amended version of the document or other material is explicitly authorized by a statute.

(b) When the amended version of a document or other material incorporated by reference in a regulation as described in (a) of this section becomes available, the state agency shall

(1) make the amended version of the document or other material available to the public for review; and

(2) post on the Alaska Online Public Notice System and publish in a newspaper of general circulation or trade or industry publication or in a regularly published agency newsletter or similar printed publication, not later than 15 days after the amended version of the document or other material becomes available, a notice that describes the affected regulation, the effective date of the amended version of the document or other material, and how a copy of the amended version may be obtained or reviewed.

(c) The state agency shall also send the notice described in (b)(2) of this section to

(1) a person who has placed the person's name on a distribution list kept by the agency that lists persons who want to receive the notice; the agency may allow a person to request that distribution of the notice be by electronic means and shall honor that request if appropriate means are available; and

(2) the regulations attorney in the Department of Law.

(d) A change in the form, format, or title in a future amended or revised version of a document or material incorporated by reference in a regulation under this section does not affect the validity of the regulation or the state agency's ability to enforce or implement the regulation. The state agency shall notify the regulations attorney in the Department of Law if the title of the document or other material changes. The regulations attorney shall correct the title in the Alaska Administrative Code under AS 44.62.125.

###### Sec. 44.62.250.   Emergency regulations.

(a) Except for a regulation adopted under AS 11.71.125, a regulation or order of repeal may be adopted as an emergency regulation or order of repeal if a state agency makes a written finding, including a statement of the facts that constitute the emergency, that the adoption of the regulation or order of repeal is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety, or general welfare. The requirements of AS 44.62.040(c), 44.62.060, and 44.62.190§44.62.215 do not apply to the initial adoption of emergency regulations; however, upon adoption of an emergency regulation, the adopting agency shall immediately submit a copy of it to the lieutenant governor for filing and for publication in the Alaska Administrative Register, and, within five days after filing by the lieutenant governor, the agency shall give notice of the adoption in accordance with AS 44.62.190(a). Failure to give the required notice by the end of the 10th day automatically repeals the regulation.

(b) A regulation or order of repeal may be adopted as an emergency regulation under  AS 11.71.125 if the attorney general makes a written finding that the requirements of  AS 11.71.125 are met. The requirements of  AS 44.62.190§ 44.62.215 do not apply to the adoption or order of repeal by the attorney general of a regulation to schedule a substance by emergency regulation under  AS 11.71.125.

###### Sec. 44.62.260.   Limitation on effective period of emergency regulations.

(a) Except as provided in (c) of this section, a regulation adopted as an emergency regulation does not remain in effect more than 120 days unless the adopting agency complies with AS 44.62.040(c), 44.62.060, and 44.62.190§44.62.215 either before submitting the regulation to the lieutenant governor or during the 120-day period.

(b) Except as provided in (c) of this section, before the expiration of the 120-day period, the agency shall transmit to the lieutenant governor for filing a certification that AS 44.62.040(c), 44.62.060, and 44.62.190§44.62.215 were complied with before submitting the regulation to the lieutenant governor, or that the agency complied with those sections within the 120-day period. Failure to so certify repeals the emergency regulation; it may not be renewed or refiled as an emergency regulation.

(c) A substance scheduled by the attorney general by emergency regulation under AS 11.71.125 will remain on the schedule under the emergency regulation for a period not to exceed 1,095 days unless the legislature schedules the substance by law or annuls the regulation by law.

###### Sec. 44.62.270.   State policy.

It is the state policy that emergencies are held to a minimum and are rarely found to exist. Nothing in this section limits the attorney general from scheduling a substance by emergency regulation under AS 11.71.125.

###### Sec. 44.62.280.   Purpose of AS 44.62.180§44.62.290.

It is the purpose of AS 44.62.180§44.62.290 to establish basic minimum procedural requirements for the adoption, amendment, or repeal of administrative regulations.  Except as provided in AS 44.62.250, AS 44.62.180§44.62.290 apply to the exercise of quasi-legislative power conferred by a statute, but nothing in AS 44.62.180§44.62.290 repeals or diminishes additional requirements imposed by the statute.  AS 44.62.180§44.62.290 are not superseded or modified by subsequent legislation except to the extent that the legislation does so expressly.

###### Sec. 44.62.290.   Limits of the application of AS 44.62.180§44.62.290.

(a) AS 44.62.180§44.62.290 do not apply to a regulation not required to be submitted to the lieutenant governor under AS 44.62.010§44.62.319.

(b) Only this section and AS 44.62.180 apply to a regulation that prescribes the organization or procedure of an agency.

#### Article 5. Judicial Review.

###### Sec. 44.62.300.   Judicial review of validity.

(a) An interested person may get a judicial declaration on the validity of a regulation by bringing an action for declaratory relief in the superior court. In addition to any other ground the court may declare the regulation invalid

(1) for a substantial failure to comply with AS 44.62.010§44.62.319; or

(2) in the case of an emergency regulation or order of repeal, upon the ground that the facts recited in the statement do not constitute an emergency under AS 44.62.250.

(b) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, a person may not bring an action in court to challenge the adoption, repeal, or amendment of a regulation by a state agency for

(1) insufficiency or inaccuracy of the information provided under AS 44.62.190(d) or (g);

(2) failure of the subject line of electronic mail or the title of a written publication to meet the requirements of AS 44.62.190(f);

(3) failure of the brief description required by AS 44.62.200(d) to comply with the requirements of AS 44.62.200(d) relating to

(A) the clarity and readability of the brief description; or

(B) the description of the changes made by the proposed adoption, amendment, or repeal of a regulation; or

(2) the person has satisfied the procedural requirements of the administrative proceeding up to the time that the person petitions for judicial relief under (b) of this section;

A person may not file the petition until 30 days after the person has filed with the state agency handling the administrative proceeding a written notice that the person intends to file the petition.

(c) In a proceeding begun under (b) of this section, if the superior court determines that the person is eligible for judicial relief under (a) of this section, the superior court may

(2) order that the administrative matter be handled by another form of dispute resolution; or

(3) establish a deadline for the state agency to issue a final administrative decision.

(d) After a person files a petition under (b) of this section, the state agency shall continue with the administrative proceeding unless the superior court

(1) enjoins the administrative proceeding under (c)(1) of this section; or

(2) issues an order under (c)(2) of this section.

(e) If the superior court decides that a person is not eligible for judicial relief under (a) of this section, a party to the administrative proceeding may exercise any right of appeal allowed under law for the final administrative decision as if the person had not filed a petition under (b) of this section.

(f) A person may not obtain judicial relief under this section in a personnel proceeding by a state agency.

#### Article 6. Open Meetings of Governmental Bodies.

###### Sec. 44.62.310.   Government meetings public.

(a) All meetings of a governmental body of a public entity of the state are open to the public except as otherwise provided by this section or another provision of law. Attendance and participation at meetings by members of the public or by members of a governmental body may be by teleconferencing. Agency materials that are to be considered at the meeting shall be made available at teleconference locations if practicable. Except when voice votes are authorized, the vote shall be conducted in such a manner that the public may know the vote of each person entitled to vote. The vote at a meeting held by teleconference shall be taken by roll call. This section does not apply to any votes required to be taken to organize a governmental body described in this subsection.

(b) If permitted subjects are to be discussed at a meeting in executive session, the meeting must first be convened as a public meeting and the question of holding an executive session to discuss matters that are listed in (c) of this section shall be determined by a majority vote of the governmental body. The motion to convene in executive session must clearly and with specificity describe the subject of the proposed executive session without defeating the purpose of addressing the subject in private. Subjects may not be considered at the executive session except those mentioned in the motion calling for the executive session unless auxiliary to the main question. Action may not be taken at an executive session, except to give direction to an attorney or labor negotiator regarding the handling of a specific legal matter or pending labor negotiations.

(c) The following subjects may be considered in an executive session:

(1) matters, the immediate knowledge of which would clearly have an adverse effect upon the finances of the public entity;

(2) subjects that tend to prejudice the reputation and character of any person, provided the person may request a public discussion;

(3) matters which by law, municipal charter, or ordinance are required to be confidential;

(4) matters involving consideration of government records that by law are not subject to public disclosure.

(d) This section does not apply to

(1) a governmental body performing a judicial or quasi-judicial function when holding a meeting solely to make a decision in an adjudicatory proceeding;

(2) juries;

(3) parole or pardon boards;

(4) meetings of a hospital medical staff;

(5) meetings of the governmental body or any committee of a hospital when holding a meeting solely to act upon matters of professional qualifications, privileges, or discipline;

(6) staff meetings or other gatherings of the employees of a public entity, including meetings of an employee group established by policy of the Board of Regents of the University of Alaska or held while acting in an advisory capacity to the Board of Regents;

(7) meetings held for the purpose of participating in or attending a gathering of a national, state, or regional organization of which the public entity, governmental body, or member of the governmental body is a member, but only if no action is taken and no business of the governmental body is conducted at the meetings; or

(8) meetings of municipal service area boards established under AS 29.35.450§29.35.490 when meeting solely to act on matters that are administrative or managerial in nature.

(e) Reasonable public notice shall be given for all meetings required to be open under this section. The notice must include the date, time, and place of the meeting and if, the meeting is by teleconference, the location of any teleconferencing facilities that will be used. Subject to posting notice of a meeting on the Alaska Online Public Notice System as required by AS 44.62.175(a), the notice may be given using print or broadcast media. The notice shall be posted at the principal office of the public entity or, if the public entity has no principal office, at a place designated by the governmental body. The governmental body shall provide notice in a consistent fashion for all its meetings.

(f) Action taken contrary to this section is voidable. A lawsuit to void an action taken in violation of this section must be filed in superior court within 180 days after the date of the action. A member of a governmental body may not be named in an action to enforce this section in the member's personal capacity. A governmental body that violates or is alleged to have violated this section may cure the violation or alleged violation by holding another meeting in compliance with notice and other requirements of this section and conducting a substantial and public reconsideration of the matters considered at the original meeting. If the court finds that an action is void, the governmental body may discuss and act on the matter at another meeting held in compliance with this section. A court may hold that an action taken at a meeting held in violation of this section is void only if the court finds that, considering all of the circumstances, the public interest in compliance with this section outweighs the harm that would be caused to the public interest and to the public entity by voiding the action. In making this determination, the court shall consider at least the following:

(1) the expense that may be incurred by the public entity, other governmental bodies, and individuals if the action is voided;

(2) the disruption that may be caused to the affairs of the public entity, other governmental bodies, and individuals if the action is voided;

(3) the degree to which the public entity, other governmental bodies, and individuals may be exposed to additional litigation if the action is voided;

(4) the extent to which the governing body, in meetings held in compliance with this section, has previously considered the subject;

(5) the amount of time that has passed since the action was taken;

(6) the degree to which the public entity, other governmental bodies, or individuals have come to rely on the action;

(7) whether and to what extent the governmental body has, before or after the lawsuit was filed to void the action, engaged in or attempted to engage in the public reconsideration of matters originally considered in violation of this section;

(2) specify the statute and regulation that the respondent is alleged to have violated, but may not consist merely of charges phrased in the language of the statute and regulation; and

(3) be verified, unless made by a public officer acting in an official capacity or by an employee of the agency on whose behalf the proceeding is to be held; the verification may be on information and belief.

###### Sec. 44.62.370.   Statement of issues.

(a) A hearing to determine whether a right, authority, license, or privilege should be granted, issued, or renewed is initiated by filing a statement of issues.  The statement of issues is a written statement specifying

(1) the statute and regulation with which the respondent must show compliance by producing proof at the hearing; and

(2) particular matters that have come to the attention of the initiating party and that would authorize a denial of the agency action sought.

(b) The statement of issues shall be verified unless made by a public officer acting in an official capacity or by an employee of the agency before which the proceeding is to be held. The verification may be on information and belief.

(c) The statement of issues, together with the form for notice of defense and other information described in AS 44.62.380, shall be delivered to the respondent or sent by certified mail to the latest address on file with the agency, except that if a hearing has already been requested by the respondent,

(2) the statement of issues together with the notice of hearing shall be delivered or mailed to the parties as provided in AS 44.62.420.

###### Sec. 44.62.380.   Service of accusation.

(a) Upon filing the accusation, the agency

(1) shall serve a copy of the accusation on the respondent as provided in (c) of this section;

(2) shall include with the accusation a post card or other form entitled "Notice of Defense" that, when signed by or on behalf of the respondent and returned to the agency, acknowledges service of the accusation and constitutes a notice of defense under AS 44.62.390;

(3) shall include in or with the copy of the accusation a statement that respondent may request a hearing by filing a notice of defense as provided in AS 44.62.390 within 15 days after the accusation is served on the respondent and that failure to do so constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing;

(4) may include with the accusation any information that it considers appropriate.

(b) The statement to respondent must be substantially in the following form:

Unless a written request for a hearing signed by or on behalf of the person named as respondent in the accompanying accusation is delivered or mailed to the agency within 15 days after the accusation was personally served on you or mailed to you, (here insert name of agency) may proceed upon the accusation without a hearing.  The request for a hearing may be made by delivering or mailing the enclosed form entitled "Notice of Defense," or by delivering or mailing a notice of defense as provided by AS 44.62.390 to: (here insert name and address of agency).

(c) The accusation and all accompanying information may be sent to the respondent by any means selected by the agency. However, the agency may not make an order adversely affecting the rights of the respondent unless the respondent is served personally or by certified mail, files a notice of defense, or otherwise appears. Service may be proved in the manner authorized in civil actions. Service by certified mail is effective if a statute or agency regulation requires the respondent to file an address with the agency and to notify the agency of a change, and if a certified letter containing the accusation and accompanying material is mailed, addressed to respondent at the latest address on file with the agency.

###### Sec. 44.62.390.   Notice of defense.

(a) Within 15 days after service upon the respondent of the accusation, the respondent may file with the agency a notice of defense.  In the notice the respondent may

(1) request a hearing;

(2) object to the accusation upon the ground that it does not state acts or omissions upon which the agency may proceed;

(3) object to the form of the accusation on the ground that it is so indefinite or uncertain that the respondent cannot identify the transaction or prepare a defense;

(4) admit the accusation in whole or in part;

(5) present new matter by way of defense.

(b) Within the time specified the respondent may file one or more notices of defense upon any or all of the grounds set out in (a) of this section but all of the notices shall be filed within that period unless the agency in its discretion authorizes the filing of a later notice.

(c) The respondent is entitled to a hearing on the merits if the respondent files a notice of defense, and the notice of defense is considered a specific denial of all parts of the accusation not expressly admitted. Failure to file the notice constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to a hearing, but the agency in its discretion may nevertheless grant a hearing. Unless objection is taken as provided in (a)(3) of this section, all objections to the form of the accusation are waived.

(d) The notice of defense must be in writing, signed by or on behalf of the respondent, and must state the respondent's mailing address.  It need not be verified or follow a particular form.

###### Sec. 44.62.400.   Amended or supplemental accusation.

At any time before the matter is submitted for decision the agency may file or permit the filing of an amended or supplemental accusation.  All parties shall be notified of the filing.  If the amended or supplemental accusation presents new charges the agency shall give the respondent a reasonable opportunity to prepare a defense to it, but the respondent is not entitled to file a further pleading unless the agency in its discretion so orders.  New charges are considered controverted.  Objections to the amended or supplemental accusation may be made orally and shall be noted in the record.

###### Sec. 44.62.410.   Time and place of hearing.

(a) The agency shall determine the time and place of hearing. The hearing shall be held in Juneau or Ketchikan, whichever is closer to the place where the transaction occurred or where the respondent resides, if the transaction occurred in or the respondent resides in the First Judicial District; in Anchorage if the transaction occurred or the respondent resides within the Third Judicial District; in Fairbanks or Nome, whichever is closer to the place where the transaction occurred or where the respondent resides, if the transaction occurred in or the respondent resides in the Second or Fourth Judicial District. The agency may, if the transaction occurred in a judicial district other than that of respondent's residence, select an appropriate place of hearing in either district. The agency may select a different place nearer the place where the transaction occurred or where the respondent resides, or the parties by agreement may select any place in the state.

(b) A party may request that the party or a witness participate by telephone in a hearing. The requesting party shall pay the costs of the telephonic participation. Unless a finding is made that the telephonic participation would substantially prejudice the rights of an opposing party, the agency shall grant the request for that party or witness to participate telephonically if

(1) no party objects;

(2) the witness lives more than 30 miles one way from the hearing site;

(3) the party lives more than 100 miles one way from the hearing site; or

(4) other good cause is shown to the satisfaction of the agency.

###### Sec. 44.62.420.   Form of notice of hearing.

(a) The agency shall deliver or mail a notice of hearing to all parties at least 10 days before the hearing. The hearing may not be held before the expiration of the time within which the respondent is entitled to file a notice of defense.

(b) The notice to respondent must be substantially in the following form but may include other information:

You are notified that a hearing will be held before (here insert name of agency) at (here insert place of hearing) upon the ............. day of ................, 2 ..., at the hour of ............, upon the charges made in the accusation served upon you.  You may be present at the hearing, may be but need not be represented by counsel, may present any relevant evidence, and will be given full opportunity to cross-examine all witnesses testifying against you. You may have subpoenas issued to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, documents or other things by applying to (here insert appropriate office or agency).

###### Sec. 44.62.430.   Subpoenas; witness fees.

(a) Before the hearing begins the agency shall issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum at the request of a party in accordance with the rules of civil procedure.  After the hearing begins the agency hearing a case or a hearing officer sitting alone may issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum.

(b) A subpoena issued under (a) of this section extends to all parts of the state and shall be served in accordance with the rules of civil procedure. A witness is not obliged to attend at a place out of the house district in which the witness resides unless the distance is less than 100 miles from the place of residence, except that the agency, upon affidavit of a party showing that the testimony of the witness is material and necessary, may endorse on the subpoena an order requiring the attendance of the witness.

(c) A witness who is not a party and who appears under a subpoena is entitled to receive

(1) fees as prescribed for a witness in court actions, unless the witness is an officer or employee of the state or a political subdivision of the state;

(2) reimbursement of transportation expenses in accordance with standards established by the Department of Administration under AS 39.20.160, for required travel in excess of 30 miles round trip from the witness's residence; and

(3) reimbursement of food and lodging expenses in accordance with standards established by the Department of Administration under AS 39.20.160 for each day of actual attendance and for each day of reasonable and necessary travel to and from the place of the hearing if the witness attends a hearing or deposition at a point so distant from the residence of the witness that a return to the residence from day to day is not practicable.

(d) Fees, transportation expenses, and food and lodging expenses shall be paid by the party at whose request the witness is subpoenaed.

###### Sec. 44.62.440.   Depositions.

(a) Upon a motion with good cause shown or upon stipulation of the parties, an agency may order discovery, including a deposition to perpetuate testimony, by any reasonable method including those methods prescribed by law in civil actions.

(b) If the witness resides outside the state and if the agency orders the taking of the testimony of the witness by deposition, the agency shall obtain an order of court to that effect by filing a petition for the taking of the deposition in the superior court nearest to the principal office of the agency. The proceedings on this order shall be in accordance with provisions governing the taking of depositions in the superior court in a civil action.

###### Sec. 44.62.450.   Hearings.

(a) A hearing in a contested case shall be presided over by a hearing officer. Unless the hearing is conducted by the office of administrative hearings (AS 44.64.010), the agency itself shall determine whether the hearing officer hears the case alone or whether the agency hears the case with the hearing officer.

(b) If the agency hears the case the hearing officer shall preside at the hearing, rule on the admission and exclusion of evidence, and advise the agency on matters of law.  The agency shall exercise all other powers relating to the conduct of the hearing, but may delegate any or all of these other powers to the hearing officer.  If the hearing officer hears a case alone, the hearing officer shall exercise all powers relating to the conduct of the hearing.

(c) A hearing officer or agency member shall voluntarily seek disqualification and withdraw from a case in which the hearing officer or agency member cannot accord a fair and impartial hearing or consideration.  A party may request the disqualification of a hearing officer or agency member by filing an affidavit, before the taking of evidence at a hearing, stating with particularity the grounds upon which it is claimed that a fair and impartial hearing cannot be accorded.  If the request concerns an agency member the issue shall be determined by the other members of the agency.  If the request concerns the hearing officer, the issue shall be determined by the agency when the agency hears the case with the hearing officer, and by the hearing officer when the officer hears the case alone.  An agency member may not withdraw voluntarily or be disqualified if the disqualification would prevent the existence of a quorum qualified to act in the particular case.

(d) The proceedings at the hearing shall be reported by a phonographic reporter or recorder, or other adequate means of assuring an accurate record.

###### Sec. 44.62.460.   Evidence rules.

(a) Oral evidence may be taken only on oath or affirmation.

(b) Each party may

(1) call and examine witnesses;

(2) introduce exhibits;

(3) cross-examine opposing witnesses on matter relevant to the issues, even though that matter was not covered in the direct examination;

(4) impeach a witness regardless of which party first called the witness to testify; and

(5) rebut the adverse evidence.

(c) If the respondent does not testify in behalf of the respondent, the respondent may be called and examined as if under cross-examination.

(d) The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of a common law or statutory rule that makes improper the admission of the evidence over objection in a civil action.  Hearsay evidence may be used to supplement or explain direct evidence but is not sufficient by itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in a civil action.  The rules of privilege are effective to the same extent that they are recognized in a civil action.  Irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

(e) Unless a different standard of proof is stated in applicable law, the

(1) petitioner has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence if an accusation has been filed under AS 44.62.360 or if the renewal of a right, authority, license, or privilege has been denied;

(2) respondent has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence if a right, authority, license, or privilege has been initially denied or not issued.

###### Sec. 44.62.470.   Evidence by affidavit.

(a) At any time 10 or more days before a hearing or a continued hearing, a party may mail or deliver to the opposing party a copy of an affidavit that the party proposes to introduce in evidence, together with a notice as provided in (b) of this section.  Unless the opposing party, within seven days after that mailing or delivery, mails or delivers to the proponent a request to cross-examine an affiant, the party's right to cross-examine the affiant is waived and the affidavit, if introduced in evidence, shall be given the same effect as if the affiant had testified orally.  If an opportunity to cross-examine an affiant is not given after request for it is made, the affidavit may be introduced in evidence, but shall be given only the same effect as other hearsay evidence.

(b) The notice referred to in (a) of this section must be substantially in the following form:

The accompanying affidavit of (here insert name of affiant) will be introduced as evidence at the hearing in (here insert title of proceeding). (Here insert name of affiant) will not be called to testify orally and you may not question the affiant unless you notify (here insert name of proponent or the proponent's attorney) at (here insert address) that you wish to cross-examine the affiant.  To be effective your request must be mailed or delivered to (here insert name of proponent or the proponent's attorney) before (here insert a date eight days after the date of mailing or delivering the affidavit to the opposing party).

###### Sec. 44.62.480.   Official notice.

In reaching a decision official notice may be taken, either before or after submission of the case for decision, of a generally accepted technical or scientific matter within the agency's special field, and of a fact that is judicially noticed by the courts of the state. Parties present at the hearing shall be informed of the matters to be noticed, and those matters shall be noted in the record, referred to in the record, or appended to it.  A party present at the hearing shall, upon request, be given a reasonable opportunity to refute the officially noticed matters by evidence or by written or oral presentation of authority.  The agency shall determine the manner of this refutation.

###### Sec. 44.62.490.   Amendment of accusation after submission.

The agency may order amendment of the accusation after submission of the case for decision.  Each party shall be given notice of the intended amendment and opportunity to show that the party will be prejudiced by it unless the case is reopened to permit the introduction of additional evidence in behalf of the party.  If prejudice is shown, the agency shall reopen the case to permit the introduction of additional evidence.

###### Sec. 44.62.500.   Decision in a contested case.

(a) If a contested case is heard before an agency

(1) the hearing officer who presided at the hearing shall be present during the consideration of the case and, if requested, shall assist and advise the agency; and

(2) a member of the agency who has not heard the evidence may not vote on the decision.

(b) If a contested case is heard by a hearing officer alone, the hearing officer shall prepare a proposed decision in a form that may be adopted as the decision in the case. A copy of the proposed decision shall be filed by the agency as a public record with the lieutenant governor, and a copy of the proposed decision shall be served by the agency on each party in the case and the party's attorney. Except as otherwise provided in AS 44.64.060(e), for a hearing conducted by the office of administrative hearings, the agency itself may adopt the proposed decision in its entirety, or may reduce the proposed penalty and adopt the balance of the proposed decision.

(c) If the proposed decision is not adopted as provided in (b) of this section the agency may decide the case upon the record, including the transcript, with or without taking additional evidence, or may refer the case to the same or another hearing officer to take additional evidence. If the case is so assigned the hearing officer shall prepare a proposed decision as provided in (b) of this section upon the additional evidence and the transcript and other papers that are part of the record of the earlier hearing. A copy of the proposed decision shall be furnished to each party and the party's attorney as prescribed by (b) of this section. The agency may not decide a case provided for in this subsection without giving the parties the opportunity to present either oral or written argument before the agency. If additional oral evidence is introduced before the agency, an agency member may not vote unless that member has heard the additional oral evidence. This subsection does not apply to a hearing conducted by the office of administrative hearings.

###### Sec. 44.62.510.   Form and retroactivity of decision.

(a) A decision shall be written and must contain findings of fact, a determination of the issues presented, and the penalty, if any. The findings may be stated in the language of the pleadings or by reference to them. Copies of the decision shall be delivered to the parties personally or sent to them by certified mail.

(b) A decision in a primarily judicial proceeding has retroactive effect in the same manner as a decision of a state court.

###### Sec. 44.62.520.   Effective date of decision; stay.

(a) A decision becomes effective 30 days after it is delivered or mailed to the respondent unless

(1) a reconsideration is ordered within that time;

(2) the agency itself orders that the decision become effective sooner; or

(3) a stay of execution is granted for a particular purpose and not to postpone judicial review.

(b) A stay of execution may be included in the decision or, if not included in it, may be granted by the agency at any time before the decision becomes effective.  The stay of execution may be accompanied by an express condition that the respondent comply with specified terms of probation.  The terms of probation shall be just and reasonable in the light of the findings and decision.

(c) If the respondent was required to register with a public officer, a notification of suspension or revocation shall be sent to that officer after the decision becomes effective.

###### Sec. 44.62.530.   Default.

If the respondent does not file a notice of defense or does not appear at the hearing, the agency may take action based upon the respondent's express admissions or upon other evidence, and affidavits may be used as evidence without notice to the respondent. If the burden of proof is on the respondent to establish that the respondent is entitled to the agency action sought, the agency may act without taking evidence.  Nothing in this chapter may be construed to deprive the respondent of the right to make a showing by way of mitigation.

###### Sec. 44.62.540.   Reconsideration.

(a) The agency may order a reconsideration of all or part of the case on its own motion or on petition of a party. To be considered by the agency, a petition for reconsideration must be filed with the agency within 15 days after delivery or mailing of the decision. The power to order a reconsideration expires 30 days after the delivery or mailing of a decision to the respondent. If no action is taken on a petition within the time allowed for ordering reconsideration, the petition is considered denied.

(b) The case may be reconsidered by the agency on all the pertinent parts of the record and the additional evidence and argument that are permitted, or may be assigned to a hearing officer.  A reconsideration assigned to a hearing officer is subject to the procedure provided in AS 44.62.500.  If oral evidence is introduced before the agency, an agency member may not vote unless that member has heard the evidence.

###### Sec. 44.62.550.   Petition for reinstatement or reduction of penalty.

A person whose license is revoked or suspended may petition the agency for reinstatement or reduction of penalty after one year from the effective date of the decision or from the date of the denial of a similar petition.  The agency shall give notice to the attorney general of the filing of the petition, and the attorney general and the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to present either oral or written argument before the agency.  The agency shall decide the petition, and the decision must include the reasons for the decision.  This section does not apply if the statutes dealing with the particular agency contain different provisions for reinstatement or reduction of penalty.

###### Sec. 44.62.560.   Judicial review.

(a) Judicial review by the superior court of a final administrative order may be had by filing a notice of appeal in accordance with the applicable rules of court governing appeals in civil matters. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after the last day on which reconsideration can be ordered, and served on each party to the proceeding.  The right to appeal is not affected by the failure to seek reconsideration before the agency.

(b) The complete record of the proceedings, or the parts of it which the appellant designates, shall be prepared by the agency.  A copy shall be delivered to all parties participating in the appeal.  The original shall be filed in the superior court within 30 days after the appellant pays the estimated cost of preparing the complete or designated record or files a corporate surety bond equal to the estimated cost.

(c) The complete record includes

(1) the pleadings;

(2) all notices and orders issued by the agency;

(3) the proposed decision by a hearing officer;

(4) the final decision;

(5) a transcript of all testimony and proceedings;

(6) the exhibits admitted or rejected;

(7) the written evidence; and

(8) all other documents in the case.

(d) Upon order of the superior court, appeals may be taken on the original record or parts of it.  The record may be typewritten or duplicated by any standard process.  Analogous rules of court governing appeals in civil matters shall be followed where this chapter is silent, and when not in conflict with this chapter.

(e) The superior court may enjoin agency action in excess of constitutional or statutory authority at any stage of an agency proceeding.  If agency action is unlawfully withheld or unreasonably withheld, the superior court may compel the agency to initiate action.

###### Sec. 44.62.570.   Scope of review.

(a) An appeal shall be heard by the superior court sitting without a jury.

(b) Inquiry in an appeal extends to the following questions: (1) whether the agency has proceeded without, or in excess of jurisdiction; (2) whether there was a fair hearing; and (3) whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.

(c) The court may exercise its independent judgment on the evidence.  If it is claimed that the findings are not supported by the evidence, abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by

(1) the weight of the evidence; or

(2) substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.

(d) The court may augment the agency record in whole or in part, or hold a hearing de novo.  If the court finds that there is relevant evidence which, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, could not have been produced or which was improperly excluded at the hearing, the court may

(1) enter judgment as provided in (e) of this section and remand the case to be reconsidered in the light of that evidence; or

(2) admit the evidence at the appellate hearing without remanding the case.

(e) The court shall enter judgment setting aside, modifying, remanding, or affirming the order or decision, without limiting or controlling in any way the discretion legally vested in the agency.

(f) The court in which proceedings under this section are started may stay the operation of the administrative order or decision until

(1) the court enters judgment;

(2) a notice of further appeal from the judgment is filed; or

(3) the time for filing the notice of appeal expires.

(g) A stay may not be imposed or continued if the court is satisfied that it is against the public interest.

(h) If further appeal is taken, the supreme court may, in its discretion, stay the superior court judgment or agency order.

(i) If a final administrative order or decision is the subject of a proceeding under this section, and the appeal is filed while the penalty imposed is in effect, finishing or complying with the penalty imposed by the administrative agency during the pendency of the proceeding does not make the determination moot.

###### Sec. 44.62.580.   Continuances.

The agency may grant continuances.  If a hearing officer is assigned to a hearing, a continuance may not be granted except by the hearing officer for good cause shown.

###### Sec. 44.62.590.   Contempt.

(a) In a proceeding before an agency, the agency shall certify the facts to the superior court in the judicial district where the proceeding is held if a person in the proceeding

(1) disobeys or resists a lawful order;

(2) refuses to respond to a subpoena;

(3) refuses to take oath or affirmation as a witness;

(4) refuses to be examined; or

(5) is guilty of misconduct at a hearing or so near the hearing as to obstruct the proceeding.

(c) After service under (b) of this section, the court has jurisdiction of the matter.

(d) The law applicable to contempt committed by a person in the trial of a civil action before the superior court applies to contempt under this section as to

(1) the proceeding taken;

(2) the penalties imposed; and

(3) the way the person charged may be purged of the contempt.

###### Sec. 44.62.610.   Charge.

A sum authorized to be spent under AS 44.62.330§44.62.630 by an agency is a legal charge against the appropriations of the agency.

###### Sec. 44.62.620.   Power to administer oaths.

In a proceeding under AS 44.62.330§44.62.630 an agency, agency member, secretary of an agency, or hearing officer may administer oaths and affirmations and certify official acts.

###### Sec. 44.62.630.   Impartiality.

The functions of hearing officers and those officers participating in decisions shall be conducted in an impartial manner with due regard for the rights of all parties and the facts and the law, and consistent with the orderly and prompt dispatch of proceedings.  These officers, except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte matters authorized by law, may not engage in interviews with, or receive evidence or argument from, a party, directly or indirectly, except upon opportunity for all other parties to be present.

###### Sec. 44.62.650.   [Renumbered as AS 44.62.950.]

#### Article 9. Negotiated Regulation Making.

###### Sec. 44.62.710.   Purpose and applicability of AS 44.62.710§44.62.800.

(a) The purpose of AS 44.62.710§44.62.800 is to establish a framework for the conduct of negotiated regulation making consistent with AS 44.62.010§44.62.319. Negotiated regulation making is not a substitute for the requirements of AS 44.62.010§44.62.319 but may be used as a supplemental procedure to permit the direct participation of affected interests in the development of new regulations or the amendment or repeal of existing regulations. A consensus agreement reached by a negotiated regulation making committee may be modified by an agency head as a result of the subsequent regulation making process. AS 44.62.710§44.62.800 may not be construed as an attempt to limit innovation and experimentation with the negotiated regulation making process or to limit other means to obtain public participation in the regulation making process.

(b) The provisions of AS 44.62.710§44.62.800 may be used by an agency even if other provisions of this chapter do not apply to that agency.

###### Sec. 44.62.720.   Determination of need for negotiated regulation making committee.

(a) In addition to the regulation adoption requirements under AS 44.62.010§44.62.319, an agency head may determine that the use of a negotiated regulation making committee to negotiate and develop a proposed regulation is in the public interest. In making that determination, the agency head is advised to consider whether

(1) there is a need for a regulation, including whether any legal action is pending that might resolve the need;

(2) there are a limited number of identifiable interests that are held by more than one person and that will be significantly affected by the regulation;

(3) there is a reasonable likelihood that a committee can be convened with a balanced representation of persons who

(A) can adequately represent the interests identified under (2) of this section; and

(B) are willing to negotiate in good faith to reach a consensus on the proposed regulation;

(4) there is a reasonable likelihood that a committee will reach a consensus on the proposed regulation within a fixed period of time;

(5) the negotiated regulation making procedure will not unreasonably delay the adoption of the final regulation;

(6) the agency has adequate resources and is willing to commit those resources, including technical assistance, to the committee; and

(7) the agency head, to the maximum extent possible consistent with the legal or other obligations of the agency, will use the consensus of the committee as the basis for the regulation proposed by the agency under AS 44.62.010§44.62.319.

(b) Upon determining that a negotiated regulation making committee will be formed, an agency head shall notify the public so that interested persons can apply to be appointed to the committee.

###### Sec. 44.62.730.   Use of convener.

(a) An agency head may use the services of an impartial person as a convener to assist in making the determination of need under AS 44.62.720 and to assist the agency to

(1) identify the persons who will be significantly affected by a proposed regulation; and

(2) conduct discussions with affected persons on the issues of concern and determine whether the establishment of a negotiated regulation making committee is feasible and appropriate for the particular proposed regulation.

(b) A person acting as a convener may also be named as a facilitator under AS 44.62.760. The convener shall report findings and make recommendations to the agency. The report and recommendations of the convener shall be made available to the public upon request.

###### Sec. 44.62.740.   Establishment, time line, support, and termination of committee.

(a) The agency head may establish a negotiated regulation making committee to assist in the formulation of a proposed regulation. The agency head should strive to achieve and maintain throughout the negotiated regulation making process the balanced committee representation described under AS 44.62.720(a)(3). Members of the committee serve at the pleasure of the agency head. If a committee member is unable to attend a meeting, the agency head may select a designee to serve in that member's place for a meeting.

(b) Before notifying the public under AS 44.62.720(b), the agency head shall establish a time line for the work of the committee. The time line must include a completion date for the transmission to the agency of the report described in AS 44.62.750(d) or (e). The agency shall provide the time line to persons who apply for appointment to the committee. At its first meeting, the committee shall review the time line and recommend to the agency head any revisions to the time line. The agency head shall consider any recommendations and revise the time line if necessary to further the purposes of the negotiated regulation making process.

(c) The agency head may expand the membership of the negotiated regulation making committee if necessary to facilitate the workings of the committee.

(d) The agency shall make available administrative support to the negotiated regulation making committee, including technical support, that the agency head determines necessary.

(e) A negotiated regulation making committee terminates upon adoption under AS 44.62.010§44.62.319 of the final regulation under consideration unless the agency head specifies an earlier termination date.

###### Sec. 44.62.750.   Committee duties, procedures, and report.

(a) A negotiated regulation making committee shall consider the matter proposed by the agency head for consideration and shall attempt to reach consensus concerning a proposed regulation and any other matter on which the agency head requests assistance and that is relevant to the proposed regulation.

(b) The person representing the agency on a negotiated regulation making committee shall participate in the deliberations of the committee with the same rights and responsibilities of other members of the committee and is authorized to fully represent the agency in the discussions and negotiations of the committee.

(c) An agency head may adopt procedures for the operation of the negotiated regulation making committee. The agency head shall appoint the chair of the committee.

(d) If a negotiated regulation making committee achieves consensus on a proposed regulation on or before the completion date established under AS 44.62.740(b), the committee shall transmit to the agency head that established the committee a report containing the proposed regulation.

(e) If a negotiated regulation making committee does not reach a consensus on the proposed regulation on or before the completion date established under AS 44.62.740(b), the committee shall transmit to the agency head a report specifying areas in which the committee reached consensus and the issues that remain unresolved. The committee may include in the report other information, recommendations, or materials that the committee considers appropriate. A member of the committee may include as an addendum to the report additional information, recommendations, or materials.

(f) AS 44.62.310§44.62.319 (Open Meetings Act) apply to meetings of a negotiated regulation making committee.

###### Sec. 44.62.760.   Facilitator selection, duties, and authority.

(a) An agency head may appoint a person who is impartial to serve as a facilitator for the negotiations of a negotiated regulation making committee. A person designated to represent the agency on substantive issues may not serve as facilitator.

(b) A facilitator appointed or selected under (a) of this section shall

(1) preside at the meetings of the committee in an impartial manner, unless the agency head has designated another person as chair;

(2) impartially assist the members of the committee to conduct discussions and negotiations and to achieve consensus;

(3) coordinate with the agency head regarding the management of records of the committee; and

(4) perform other duties related to the negotiated regulation making committee that are assigned by the agency head.

(c) A facilitator does not have decision-making authority for the committee.

###### Sec. 44.62.770.   Employees, contractors, and funding.

(a) An agency head may appoint an agency employee or obtain the services of another state employee or a private contractor to serve as a convener or facilitator for a negotiated regulation making committee.

(b) Before appointing or selecting a convener under AS 44.62.730 or a facilitator under AS 44.62.760, an agency head shall determine whether a person being considered has a financial or other interest that would prevent the person from serving in an impartial and independent manner. A person disqualified under this criterion may not be considered further.

(c) A member of a negotiated regulation making committee shall disclose to the agency and other members of the committee a grant, gift, or other financial benefit that exceeds $150 and that has been accepted by the disclosing member to finance the disclosing member's participation on the negotiated regulation making committee.

###### Sec. 44.62.780.   Judicial review.

An agency action relating to establishing, assisting, or terminating a negotiated regulation making committee under AS 44.62.710§44.62.800 is not subject to judicial review. Nothing in this section bars judicial review if the judicial review is otherwise provided by law. A regulation that is the product of negotiated regulation making and is later subject to judicial review may not be given greater deference by a court for that reason than a regulation that is not the product of negotiated regulation making.

###### Sec. 44.62.790.   Relationship to other requirements.

The negotiated regulation making authorized by AS 44.62.710§44.62.800 is in addition to the procedures required under AS 44.62.010§44.62.319 for adopting, amending, or repealing regulations, and, if an agency head decides to use negotiated regulation making, the negotiated regulation making shall, where possible, occur before the procedures under AS 44.62.010§44.62.319 begin.

###### Sec. 44.62.795.   Confidentiality of certain records and documents.

Notwithstanding AS 40.25.100§40.25.220, records from private persons that are requested or used by a negotiated regulation making committee and working documents prepared by the committee that analyze or incorporate information from the records shall be kept confidential if the records or working documents contain proprietary information and the owner of the records or working documents requests that the records or working documents be kept confidential.

However, the individual, board, or commission that participates under this subsection may not serve as the administrative law judge or preside during the hearing and may not take action on behalf of the agency in the agency's capacity as a party to the proceedings.

(d) An administrative law judge employed or retained by the office shall, within 120 days after the date the agency received the request for a hearing, prepare a proposed decision, unless another time period is provided by law or agreed to by the parties and the chief administrative law judge.

The proposed decision is a public record, except as otherwise provided by statute.

Unless the office has established a shorter time period or another statute has established a different time period, within 30 days after the proposed decision is served, a party may file with the agency a proposal for action under (1)§(5) of this subsection.

Notwithstanding AS 44.62.450(c), upon receipt of the affidavit, the administrative law judge assigned to the administrative hearing shall make a determination. If the affiant objects to the decision, the matter shall be decided by the chief administrative law judge, whose decision is final, or if the hearing is assigned to the chief administrative law judge, by the attorney general, whose decision is final.

(c) In addition to disqualification of an administrative law judge under (a) and (b) of this section, each side is entitled to change the assigned administrative law judge once.

A party wishing to exercise the right to change the administrative law judge shall give notice to the chief administrative law judge within five days after notice is given that the case has been assigned.

The authority may issue bonds to pay, fund, or refund the principal of, or interest or redemption premiums on, bonds issued by it, whether or not the bonds or interest to be funded or refunded have become due.

(b) Bonds shall be authorized by resolution of the authority, and shall be dated and shall mature as the resolution may provide, except that no bond may mature more than 50 years from the date of its issue.

(d) All bonds may be sold at public or private sale in the manner, for the price or prices, and at the time or times which the authority may determine.

###### Sec. 44.83.105.   Bonds for power projects under the energy program for Alaska. [Repealed,§28 ch 18 SLA 1993.]

###### Sec. 44.83.110.   Trust indentures and trust agreements.

(a) In the discretion of the authority, an issue of bonds may be secured by a trust indenture or trust agreement between the authority and a corporate trustee (which may be a trust company, bank, or national banking association, with corporate trust powers, located inside or outside the state) or by a secured loan agreement or other instrument or under a resolution giving powers to a corporate trustee by means of which the authority may

(1) make and enter into any and all the covenants and agreements with the trustee or the holders of the bonds that the authority may determine to be necessary or desirable, including, without limitation, covenants, provisions, limitations, and agreements as to

(A) the application, investment, deposit, use, and disposition of the proceeds of bonds of the authority or of money or other property of the authority or in which it has an interest;

(B) the fixing and collection of rentals, charges, fees, or other consideration for, and the other terms to be incorporated in, contracts with respect to a project or to generated power;

(C) the assignment by the authority of its rights in contracts with respect to a project or to generated power or in a mortgage or other security interest created with respect to a project or generated power to a trustee for the benefit of bondholders;

(D) the terms and conditions upon which additional bonds of the authority may be issued;

(E) the vesting in a trustee of rights, powers, duties, funds, or property in trust for the benefit of bondholders, including, without limitation, the right to enforce payment, performance, and all other rights of the authority or of the bondholders, under a lease, power of contract, contract of sale, mortgage, security agreement, or trust agreement with respect to a project by injunction or other proceeding or by taking possession of by agent or otherwise and operating a project and collecting rents or other consideration and applying the same in accordance with the trust agreement;

(2) pledge, mortgage, or assign money, leases, agreements, property, or other rights or assets of the authority either presently in hand or to be received in the future, or both; and

(3) provide for any other matters of like or different character that in any way affect the security or protection of the bonds.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the trust indenture, trust agreement, secured loan agreement, or other instrument or the resolution constituting a contract with bondholders shall contain a covenant by the authority that it will at all times maintain rates, fees, or charges sufficient to pay, and that a contract entered into by the authority for the sale, transmission, or distribution of power shall contain rates, fees, or charges sufficient to pay the costs of operation and maintenance of the project, the principal of and interest on bonds issued under the trust agreement as the same severally become due and payable, to provide for debt service coverage as considered necessary by the authority for the marketing of its bonds and to provide for renewals, replacements, and improvements of the project, and to maintain reserves required by the terms of the trust agreement. This subsection does not require a covenant that varies from a covenant entered into in accordance with the provisions of former AS 44.83.380§44.83.425.

(c) For the purpose of securing any one or more issues of its bonds, the authority may establish one or more special funds, called "capital reserve funds", and shall pay into those capital reserve funds the proceeds of the sale of its bonds and any other money that may be made available to the authority for the purposes of those funds from any other source.  The funds shall be established only if the authority determines that the establishment would enhance the marketability of the bonds.  All money held in a capital reserve fund, except as provided in this section, shall be used as required, solely for (1) the payment of the principal of, and interest on, bonds or of the sinking fund payments with respect to those bonds, (2) the purchase or redemption of bonds, or (3) the payment of a redemption premium required to be paid when those bonds are redeemed before maturity; however, money in a fund may not be withdrawn from it at any time in an amount that would reduce the amount of that fund to less than the capital reserve requirement set out in (2) of this subsection, except for the purpose of making, with respect to those bonds, payment, when due, of principal, interest, redemption premiums, and the sinking fund payments for the payment of which other money of the authority is not available.  Income or interest earned by, or increment to, a capital reserve fund, due to the investment of the fund or any other amounts in it, may be transferred by the authority to other funds or accounts of the authority to the extent that the transfer does not reduce the amount of the capital reserve fund below the capital reserve fund requirement.

(d) If the authority decides to issue bonds secured by such a capital reserve fund, the bonds may not be issued if the amount in the capital reserve fund is less than such an amount as may be established by resolution of the authority (called the "capital reserve fund requirement"), unless the authority, at the time of issuance of the obligations, deposits in the capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the obligations to be issued or from other sources, an amount which, together with the amount then in the fund, will not be less than the capital reserve fund requirement.

(e) In computing the amount of a capital reserve fund for the purpose of this section, securities in which all or a portion of the funds are invested shall be valued by some reasonable method established by the authority by resolution.  Valuation on a particular date shall include the amount of any interest earned or accrued to that date.

(f) The chairman of the authority shall annually, no later than January 2, make and deliver to the governor and the legislature a certificate stating the sum, if any, required to restore any capital reserve fund to the capital reserve fund requirement.  The legislature may appropriate such a sum, and all sums appropriated during the then current fiscal year by the legislature for such restoration shall be deposited by the authority in the proper capital reserve fund.  Nothing in this section creates a debt or liability of the state.

(g) When the authority has created and established a capital reserve fund, the commissioner of revenue may lend surplus money in the general fund to the authority for deposit in a capital reserve fund in an amount equal to the capital reserve fund requirement. The loans shall be made on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the commissioner of revenue and the authority, including without limitation terms and conditions providing that the loans need not be repaid until the obligations of the authority secured and to be secured by the capital reserve fund are no longer outstanding.

(h) If the authority decides to covenant to issue or to issue bonds secured by a capital reserve fund, the bonds may not be issued until 10 days after the authority has mailed notification to the state bond committee and the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee by certified mail of its intention to establish a capital reserve fund to secure the bond issue. The notification shall include the amount of the capital reserve fund to be established, the amount of bonds proposed to be issued, and the total cost of the project for which the bonds are to be issued.  The notification shall be accompanied by an estimate by the authority of the need to withdraw money from the capital reserve fund during the term of the bond issue, the amount that it may be necessary to withdraw, and the time at which withdrawals are estimated to be needed.  The authority shall annually prepare a revised estimate, considering the same factors, and a statement of all withdrawals that have occurred from the date of issuance of the bonds to the end of the calendar year.  The revised estimate and statement shall be submitted to the state bond committee and the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee by January 30 of the succeeding year.

###### Sec. 44.83.120.   Validity of pledge.

It is the intention of the legislature that a pledge made in respect of bonds is considered perfected and is valid and binding from the time the pledge is made; that the money or property so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery or further act; and that the lien of the pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority irrespective of whether the parties have notice. Neither the resolution, trust agreement, nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded or filed under the provisions of AS 45.01§AS 45.08, AS 45.12, AS 45.14, and AS 45.29 (Uniform Commercial Code) to be perfected or to be valid, binding, or effective against the parties.

###### Sec. 44.83.130.   Nonliability on bonds.

(a) Neither the members of the authority nor a person executing the bonds is liable personally on the bonds or is subject to personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of the bonds.

(b) The bonds issued by the authority do not constitute an indebtedness or other liability of the state or of a political subdivision of the state, except the authority, but shall be payable solely from the income and receipts or other funds or property of the authority.  The authority may not pledge the faith or credit of the state or of a political subdivision of the state, except the authority, to the payment of a bond and the issuance of a bond by the authority does not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or a political subdivision of the state to apply money from, or levy or pledge any form of taxation whatever to the payment of the bond.

###### Sec. 44.83.140.   Pledge of the state.

The state pledges to and agrees with the holders of bonds issued under this chapter and with the federal agency which loans or contributes funds in respect to a project, that the state will not limit or alter the rights and powers vested in the authority by this chapter to fulfill the terms of a contract made by the authority with the holders or federal agency, or in any way impair the rights and remedies of the holders until the bonds, together with the interest on them with interest on unpaid installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with an action or proceeding by or on behalf of the holders, are fully met and discharged. The authority is authorized to include this pledge and agreement of the state, insofar as it refers to holders of bonds of the authority, in a contract with the holders, and insofar as it relates to a federal agency, in a contract with the federal agency.

###### Sec. 44.83.150.   Tax exemption.

All property of the authority is public property devoted to an essential public and governmental function and purpose and is exempt from all taxes of the state or a political subdivision of the state; however, the authority may make payments in place of taxes in amounts equal to the real and personal property taxes that would be assessed on its real and personal property by each political subdivision in which its property is located to the same extent as if that property were private property and the authority were a non-public corporation.  All bonds issued under this chapter are issued by a body corporate and public of this state and for an essential public and governmental purpose and the bonds and the interest and income on and from the bonds and all income of the authority are exempt from taxation except for transfer, inheritance, and estate taxes.

###### Sec. 44.83.160.   Bonds legal investments for fiduciaries.

The bonds of the authority are securities in which all public officers and bodies of the state and all municipalities and municipal subdivisions, all insurance companies and associations and other persons carrying on any insurance business, all banks, bankers, trust companies, savings banks, savings associations, including savings and loan associations and building and loan associations, investment companies and other persons carrying on a banking business, all administrators, guardians, executors, trustees and other fiduciaries, and all other persons whatsoever who are now or may hereafter be authorized to invest in bonds or other obligations of the state, may properly and legally invest funds including capital in their control or belonging to them. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the bonds of the authority are also securities that may be deposited with and may be received by all public officers and bodies of this state and all municipalities and municipal subdivisions for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or other obligations of the state is now or may hereafter be authorized.

## Chapter 85. Alaska Municipal Bond Bank Authority.

###### Sec. 44.85.005.   Legislative findings.

The legislature finds that

(1) the rapid growth of municipalities in the state and the incorporation of new municipalities has created a demand for capital improvements that can only be met by these municipalities borrowing money through the issuance of bonds or notes;

(2) many of these municipalities, although creditworthy, either have not issued bonds or notes or have little outstanding debt;

(3) the cost of borrowed money to these municipalities is or may be unnecessarily high due to lack of investor familiarity with the municipalities;

(4) other municipalities in the state pay unnecessarily high borrowing costs because of the distance of the state from capital markets or may find borrowing difficult or impossible because of temporary economic dislocation due to loss of employment or prospective loss of employment;

(5) the University of Alaska has limited debt capacity and may pay higher interest rates because of lower credit ratings;

(6) many municipalities provide for or partner with nonprofit organizations to provide for delivery of health care;

(7) nonprofit regional health organizations deliver services in many locations where municipal partners are unavailable;

(8) joint action agencies require financial assistance for public utility projects, including hydroelectric power projects, that benefit municipalities.

###### Sec. 44.85.010.   Legislative policy.

(a) It is the policy of the state to

(1) foster and promote by all reasonable means the provision of adequate capital markets and facilities for borrowing money by municipalities in the state to finance capital improvements or for other authorized purposes, to assist these municipalities in fulfilling their capital needs and requirements by use of borrowed money within statutory interest rate or cost of borrowing limitations, to the greatest extent possible to reduce costs of borrowed money to taxpayers and residents of the state, and equally to encourage continued investor interest in the purchase of bonds or notes of municipalities as sound and preferred securities for investment;

(2) encourage municipalities to continue their independent undertakings and financing of capital improvements and other authorized purposes and to assist them by making capital funds available at reduced interest costs for orderly financing of capital improvements and other purposes especially during periods of restricted credit or money supply, particularly for those municipalities not otherwise able to borrow for capital needs;

(3) assist municipalities to provide for adequate insurance coverage by authorizing the Alaska Municipal Bond Bank Authority to issue negotiable or nonnegotiable revenue bonds, notes, or certificates of participation either directly or through an entity it may create for the purpose of providing a self-insurance program for municipalities or municipal joint insurance arrangements organized under AS 21.76;

(4) assist governmental employers to prepay all or a portion of their share of unfunded accrued actuarial liabilities of retirement systems in an effort to reduce their costs of satisfying their contractual obligations to provide retirement and other benefits to public employees through the issuance of bonds, notes, commercial paper, or other obligations by the bond bank authority or by a subsidiary corporation created by the bond bank authority under AS 44.85.085, but only after submitting a proposal to the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee and if the state bond rating is the equivalent of AA- or better; this assistance is limited as provided in AS 37.15.903;

(5) assist the University of Alaska by providing capital funds through loans that minimize costs and the effects on the debt capacity of the University of Alaska;

(6) assist regional health organizations to provide health care facilities by providing capital funds through loans that minimize costs and the effects on the debt capacity of regional health organizations when the commissioner of health anticipates a state financial benefit and an increase in regional quality of care;

(7) assist joint action agencies in providing public utilities, including hydroelectric power projects, through loans and bonds that minimize costs and the effects on the debt capacity of public utilities and joint action agencies.

(b) The legislature further declares that

(1) the exercise of the powers of the state in the interest of its municipalities and in the interest of public employees of the state and of its municipalities is required to further and implement the policies declared in (a) of this section by authorizing the creation of a state bond bank authority as a body corporate and politic that will have full powers to borrow money and to issue its bonds and notes to make capital funds available for borrowing by municipalities and for borrowing by or on behalf of governmental employers, by authorizing governmental employers to contract with the bond bank authority or with a subsidiary created under AS 44.85.085 for the purpose of reducing future costs of providing retirement and other benefits to employees, and by granting broad powers to the bond bank authority to carry out the declared policies, which are in the public interest of the state and its taxpayers and residents;

(2) state funds should be applied or authorized to be paid to a state bond bank authority only to provide adequate assurance and security to the holders of the bonds or notes of the bond bank authority;

(3) the bond bank authority should conduct its operations to provide the lowest rates in terms of borrowing to municipalities as is consistent with a self-supporting operation with no expectation of subsidization with state funds; the legislature does not intend that the bond bank authority be utilized as a means to finance municipalities beyond their capability to meet repayment schedules and debt service requirements of bonds or notes;

(4) the bond bank authority or its subsidiary should conduct its operations to provide the lowest rates in terms of borrowing to governmental employers under AS 44.85.085 and 44.85.086 as is consistent with a self-supporting operation with no expectation of subsidization with state funds; the legislature does not intend that the bond bank authority or its subsidiary be utilized as a means to finance governmental employers under AS 44.85.085 and 44.85.086 beyond their capability to meet repayment schedules and debt service requirements of bonds, notes, commercial paper, or other obligations to the bond bank authority or its subsidiary.

###### Sec. 44.85.020.   Municipal Bond Bank Authority.

There is created the Alaska Municipal Bond Bank Authority. The authority is a public corporation of the state.  The corporation is an instrumentality of the state within the Department of Revenue but has a legal existence independent of and separate from the state and has continuing succession until its existence is terminated by law.  The exercise by the authority of the powers conferred by this chapter is considered an essential governmental function of the state.

###### Sec. 44.85.030.   Membership and vacancies.

The bond bank authority consists of the following five directors: the commissioner of revenue, the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development, who shall each be a director ex officio with voting privileges, and three directors appointed by the governor. The appointment of each director other than the commissioner of revenue and the commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development is subject to confirmation by the legislature. The three directors appointed by the governor serve at the governor's pleasure for four-year terms. They must be residents of the state and qualified voters at the time of appointment and shall comply with the requirements of AS 39.50 (public official financial disclosure). Each director shall hold office for the term of appointment and until a successor has been appointed and qualified. A director is eligible for reappointment. A vacancy in a directorship occurring other than by expiration of term shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment but for the unexpired term only.

The powers of the bond bank authority are vested in the directors, and three directors of the bond bank authority constitute a quorum.  Action may be taken and motions and resolutions adopted by the bond bank authority at any meeting by the affirmative vote of at least three directors.  A vacancy in the directorship of the bond bank authority does not impair the right of a quorum to exercise all the powers and perform all the duties of the bond bank authority.

(b) The bond bank authority may meet and transact business by an electronic medium if (1) public notice of the time and locations where the meeting will be held by an electronic medium has been given in the same manner as if the meeting were held in a single location; (2) participants and members of the public in attendance can hear and have the same right to participate in the meeting as if the meeting were conducted in person; and (3) copies of pertinent reference materials, statutes, regulations, and audio-visual materials are reasonably available to participants and to the public.  A meeting by an electronic medium as provided in this subsection has the same legal effect as a meeting in person.

###### Sec. 44.85.050.   Bonding of members.

Before the issuance of bonds or notes under this chapter, each director shall execute a surety bond in the penal sum of $25,000 and the treasurer shall execute a surety bond in the penal sum of $50,000. Each surety bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of the office of the director or treasurer, to be executed by a surety company authorized to transact business in the state as surety and filed in the office of the lieutenant governor. After issuance of bonds or notes by the bond bank authority each director shall maintain the surety bond in force.  All costs of the surety bonds shall be borne by the bond bank authority.

###### Sec. 44.85.060.   Compensation and expenses.

The directors of the bond bank authority shall serve without compensation, but the bond bank authority shall reimburse its directors for actual expenses necessarily incurred in the discharge of their duties. Notwithstanding any other law, an officer or employee of the state need not forfeit office or employment or any benefits by reason of acceptance of appointment to the office of director of the bond bank authority.

###### Sec. 44.85.070.   Staff.

The bond bank authority shall employ an executive secretary who may with the approval of the bond bank authority select and employ additional staff as necessary. Employees and agents of the bond bank authority other than legal counsel and the executive secretary are in the classified service under AS 39.25.

###### Sec. 44.88.105.   Capital reserve funds and capital reserve fund requirement.

(a) For the purpose of securing one or more issues of its bonds, the authority may establish one or more special funds, called "capital reserve funds", and shall pay into those capital reserve funds the proceeds of the sale of its bonds and other money which may be made available to the authority from other sources for the purposes of the capital reserve funds. A capital reserve fund may be established only if the authority determines that the establishment of the fund would enhance the marketability of the bonds. Money in a capital reserve fund, except as provided in this section, may be used as required only for (1) the payment of the principal of, and interest on, bonds or of the sinking fund payments with respect to those bonds; (2) the purchase or redemption of the bonds; or (3) the payment of a redemption premium required to be paid when the bonds are redeemed before maturity. However, money in a capital reserve fund may not be withdrawn if the withdrawal would reduce the amount in the capital reserve fund to less than the capital reserve fund requirement, except for the purpose of making payment, when due, of principal, interest, redemption premiums on the bonds, and sinking fund payments when other money of the authority is not available for the payments. Income or interest earned by, or increment to, a capital reserve fund, from the investment of all or part of the fund, may be transferred by the authority to other funds or accounts of the authority if the transfer does not reduce the amount of the capital reserve fund below the capital reserve fund requirement.

(b) If the authority decides to issue bonds secured by a capital reserve fund, the bonds may not be issued if the amount in the capital reserve fund is less than the capital reserve fund requirement, unless the authority, at the time of issuance of the bonds, deposits in the capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the bonds to be issued or from other sources, an amount which, together with the amount then in the fund, is not less than the capital reserve fund requirement.

(c) In computing the amount of a capital reserve fund for the purpose of this section, securities in which all or a portion of the fund is invested shall be valued by a reasonable method established by the authority by resolution.  Valuation shall include the amount of interest earned or accrued as of the date of the valuation.

(d) The chair of the authority shall annually, not later than January 2, certify in writing to the governor and the legislature the amount, if any, required to restore a capital reserve fund to the capital reserve fund requirement. The legislature may appropriate to the authority the amount certified by the chair of the authority. The authority shall deposit the amounts appropriated under this subsection during a fiscal year in the proper capital reserve fund. Nothing in this section creates a debt or liability of the state. In this subsection, "capital reserve fund" means a capital reserve fund that

(1) is created under this section on or before January 1, 1989;

(2) secures refunding bonds if the refunding bonds are issued to refund bonds that are secured by a capital reserve fund created under this section on or before January 1, 1989;

(3) secures bonds issued on or after August 11, 1993, for a power transmission intertie; or

(4) secures bonds issued on or after July 1, 2013, for a qualified energy development project financed under AS 44.88.650§44.88.690.

(e)  [Repealed,§23 ch 123 SLA 1990.]

(f) The authority may establish reserve funds, other than capital reserve funds, to secure one or more issues of its bonds. The authority may deposit in a reserve fund established under this subsection the proceeds of sale of its bonds and other money which may be made available from any other source.  A reserve fund established under this subsection must comply with (a)§(c) of this section.  The authority may allow a reserve fund established under this subsection to be depleted without complying with (d) of this section.

(g)  [Repealed,§23 ch 123 SLA 1990.]

(h) In this section, "capital reserve fund requirement" means the amount required to be on deposit in the capital reserve fund as of the date of computation as determined by resolution of the authority.

###### Sec. 44.88.110.   Validity of pledge.

It is the intention of the legislature that a pledge made in respect of bonds shall be valid and binding from the time the pledge is made; that the money or property so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery or further act; and that the lien of the pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority irrespective of whether the parties have notice. Neither the resolution, trust agreement, nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded or filed under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code to be valid, binding, or effective against the parties.

###### Sec. 44.88.120.   Nonliability on bonds.

(a) Neither the members of the authority nor a person executing the bonds are liable personally on the bonds or are subject to personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of the bonds.

(b) The bonds issued by the authority do not constitute an indebtedness or other liability of the state or of a political subdivision of the state, except the authority, but shall be payable solely from the income and receipts or other funds or property of the authority.  The authority may not pledge the faith or credit of the state or of a political subdivision of the state, except the authority, to the payment of a bond and the issuance of a bond by the authority does not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or a political subdivision of the state to apply money from, or levy or pledge any form of taxation whatever to the payment of the bond.

###### Sec. 44.88.130.   Pledge of the state.

The state pledges to and agrees with the holders of bonds issued under this chapter and with the federal agency that lends or contributes funds in respect to a project or development project financed under AS 44.88.155§44.88.159 or 44.88.172§44.88.177 that the state will not limit or alter the rights and powers vested in the authority by this chapter to fulfill the terms of a contract made by the authority with the holders or federal agency and that the state will not in any way impair the rights and remedies of the holders until the bonds, together with the interest on them with interest on unpaid installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with an action or proceeding by or on behalf of the holders are fully met and discharged. The authority is authorized to include this pledge and agreement of the state, insofar as it refers to holders of bonds of the authority, in a contract with the holders and, insofar as it relates to a federal agency, in a contract with the federal agency.

###### Sec. 44.88.140.   Exemption from taxation.

(a) Except as provided in AS 29.45.030(a)(1), the real and personal property of the authority and its assets, income, and receipts are declared to be the property of a political subdivision of the state and, together with any project or development project financed under AS 44.88.155§44.88.159 or 44.88.172§44.88.177, and a leasehold interest created in a project or development project financed under AS 44.88.155§44.88.159 or 44.88.172§44.88.177, devoted to an essential public and governmental function and purpose, and the property, assets, income, receipts, project, development project, and leasehold interests shall be exempt from all taxes and special assessments of the state or a political subdivision of the state, including, without limitation, all boroughs, cities, municipalities, school districts, public utility districts, and other taxing units. All bonds of the authority are declared to be issued by a political subdivision of the state and for an essential public and governmental purpose and to be a public instrumentality, and the bonds, and the interest on them, the income from them and the transfer of the bonds, and all assets, income, and receipts pledged to pay or secure the payments of the bonds, or interest on them, shall at all times be exempt from taxation by or under the authority of the state, except for inheritance and estate taxes and taxes on transfers by or in contemplation of death.

Section 6. Notice. All notices required by this Compact shall be by U.S. Certified Mail, return receipt requested, or an equivalent or superior form of notice, such as personal delivery documented by evidence of actual receipt.

Section 7. "Balanced Budget Amendment" means the following:

"Article  _______________

Section 1. Total outlays of the government of the United States shall not exceed total receipts of the government of the United States at any point in time unless the excess of outlays over receipts is financed exclusively by debt issued in strict conformity with this article.

Section 2. Outstanding debt shall not exceed authorized debt, which initially shall be an amount equal to 105 percent of the outstanding debt on the effective date of this article. Authorized debt shall not be increased above its aforesaid initial amount unless such increase is first approved by the legislatures of the several states as provided in Section 3.

Section 3. From time to time, Congress may increase authorized debt to an amount in excess of its initial amount set by Section 2 only if it first publicly refers to the legislatures of the several states an unconditional, single subject measure proposing the amount of such increase, in such form as provided by law, and the measure is thereafter publicly and unconditionally approved by a simple majority of the legislatures of the several states, in such form as provided respectively by state law; provided that no inducement requiring an expenditure or tax levy shall be demanded, offered or accepted as a quid pro quo for such approval. If such approval is not obtained within sixty (60) calendar days after referral then the measure shall be deemed disapproved and the authorized debt shall thereby remain unchanged.

Section 4. Whenever the outstanding debt exceeds 98 percent of the debt limit set by Section 2, the President shall enforce said limit by publicly designating specific expenditures for impoundment in an amount sufficient to ensure outstanding debt shall not exceed the authorized debt. Said impoundment shall become effective thirty (30) days thereafter, unless Congress first designates an alternate impoundment of the same or greater amount by concurrent resolution, which shall become immediately effective. The failure of the President to designate or enforce the required impoundment is an impeachable misdemeanor. Any purported issuance or incurrence of any debt in excess of the debt limit set by Section 2 is void.

Section 5. No bill that provides for a new or increased general revenue tax shall become law unless approved by a two-thirds roll call vote of the whole number of each House of Congress. However, this requirement shall not apply to any bill that provides for a new end user sales tax which would completely replace every existing income tax levied by the government of the United States; or for the reduction or elimination of an exemption, deduction, or credit allowed under an existing general revenue tax.

Section 6. For purposes of this article, "debt" means any obligation backed by the full faith and credit of the government of the United States; "outstanding debt" means all debt held in any account and by any entity at a given point in time; "authorized debt" means the maximum total amount of debt that may be lawfully issued and outstanding at any single point in time under this article; "total outlays of the government of the United States" means all expenditures of the government of the United States from any source; "total receipts of the government of the United States" means all tax receipts and other income of the government of the United States, excluding proceeds from its issuance or incurrence of debt or any type of liability; "impoundment" means a proposal not to spend all or part of a sum of money appropriated by Congress; and "general revenue tax" means any income tax, sales tax, or value-added tax levied by the government of the United States excluding imposts and duties.

Section 7. This article is immediately operative upon ratification, self-enforcing, and Congress may enact conforming legislation to facilitate enforcement."

Section 1. This Compact governs each Member State to the fullest extent permitted by their respective constitutions, superseding and repealing any conflicting or contrary law.

Section 2. By becoming a Member State, each such State offers, promises and agrees to perform and comply strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Compact, and has made such offer, promise and agreement in anticipation and consideration of, and in substantial reliance upon, such mutual and reciprocal performance and compliance by each other current and future Member State, if any. Accordingly, in addition to having the force of law in each Member State upon its respective effective date, this Compact and each of its Articles shall also be construed as contractually binding each Member State when: (a) at least one other State has likewise become a Member State by enacting substantively identical legislation adopting and agreeing to be bound by this Compact; and (b) notice of such State's Member State status is or has been seasonably received by the Compact Administrator, if any, or otherwise by the chief executive officer of each other Member State.

Section 3. For purposes of determining Member State status under this Compact, as long as all other provisions of the Compact remain identical and operative on the same terms, legislation enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound by this Compact shall be deemed and regarded as "substantively identical" with respect to such other legislation enacted by another State notwithstanding: (a) any difference in section 2 of Article IV with specific regard to the respectively enacting State's own method of appointing its member to the Commission; (b) any difference in section 5 of Article IV with specific regard to the respectively enacting State's own obligation to fund the Commission; (c) any difference in section 1 and 2 of Article VI with specific regard to the number and identity of each delegate respectively appointed on behalf of the enacting State, provided that no more than three delegates may attend and participate in the Convention on behalf of any State; or (d) any difference in section 7 of Article X with specific regard to the respectively enacting State as to whether section 1 of Article V of this Compact shall survive termination of this Compact, and thereafter become a continuing resolution of the Legislature of such State applying to Congress for the calling of a convention of the states under Article V of the Constitution of the United States, under such terms and limitations as may be specified by such State.

Section 4. When fewer than three-fourths of the States are Member States, any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting appropriate legislation, as determined by state law, and giving notice of such withdrawal to the Compact Administrator, if any, or otherwise to the chief executive officer of each other Member State. A withdrawal shall not affect the validity or applicability of the compact with respect to remaining Member States, provided that there remain at least two such States. However, once at least three-fourths of the States are Member States, then no Member State may withdraw from the Compact prior to its termination absent unanimous consent of all Member States.

Section 1. Nature of the Compact Commission. The Compact Commission ("Commission") is hereby established. It has the power and duty: (a) to appoint and oversee a Compact Administrator; (b) to encourage States to join the Compact and Congress to call the Convention in accordance with this Compact; (c) to coordinate the performance of obligations under the Compact; (d) to oversee the Convention's logistical operations as appropriate to ensure this Compact governs its proceedings; (e) to oversee the defense and enforcement of the Compact in appropriate legal venues; (f) to request funds and to disburse those funds to support the operations of the Commission, Compact Administrator, and Convention; and (g) to cooperate with any entity that shares a common interest with the Commission and engages in policy research, public interest litigation or lobbying in support of the purposes of the Compact.

It may adopt and publish corresponding bylaws and policies.

Section 2. Commission Membership. The Commission initially consists of three unpaid members. Each Member State may appoint one member to the Commission through an appointment process to be determined by their respective chief executive officer until all positions on the Commission are filled. Positions shall be assigned to appointees in the order in which their respective appointing States became Member States. The bylaws of the Commission may expand its membership to include representatives of additional Member States and to allow for modest salaries and reimbursement of expenses if adequate funding exists.

Section 3. Commission Action. Each Commission member is entitled to one vote. The Commission shall not act unless a majority of its appointed membership is present, and no action shall be binding unless approved by a majority of the Commission's appointed membership.

The Compact Administrator serves at the pleasure of the Commission and must keep the Commission seasonably apprised of the performance or nonperformance of the terms and conditions of this Compact. Any notice sent by a Member State to the Compact Administrator concerning this Compact shall be adequate notice to each other Member State provided that a copy of said notice is seasonably delivered by the Compact Administrator to each other Member State's respective chief executive officer.

Section 7. Notice of Key Events. Upon the occurrence of each of the following described events, or otherwise as soon as possible, the Compact Administrator shall immediately send the following notices to all Compact Notice Recipients, together with certified conforming copies of the chaptered version of this Compact as maintained in the statutes of each Member State: (a) whenever any State becomes a Member State, notice of that fact shall be given; (b) once at least three-fourths of the States are Member States, notice of that fact shall be given together with a statement declaring that the Legislatures of at least two-thirds of the several States have applied for a convention for proposing amendments under Article V of the Constitution of the United States, petitioning Congress to call the Convention contemplated by this Compact, and further requesting cooperation in organizing the same in accordance with this Compact; (c) once Congress has called the Convention contemplated by this Compact, and whenever the date, time and location of the Convention has been determined, notice of that fact shall be given together with the date, time and location of the Convention and other essential logistical matters; (d) upon approval of the Balanced Budget Amendment by the Convention, notice of that fact shall be given together with the transmission of certified copies of such approved proposed amendment and a statement requesting Congress to refer the same for ratification by three-fourths of the Legislatures of the several States under Article V of the Constitution of the United States (however, in no event shall any proposed amendment other than the Balanced Budget Amendment be transmitted); and (e) when any Article of this Compact prospectively ratifying the Balanced Budget Amendment is effective in any Member State, notice of the same shall be given together with a statement declaring such ratification and further requesting cooperation in ensuring that the official record confirms and reflects the effective corresponding amendment to the Constitution of the United States. However, whenever any Member State enacts appropriate legislation, as determined by the laws of the respective state, withdrawing from this Compact, the Compact Administrator shall immediately send certified conforming copies of the chaptered version of such withdrawal legislation as maintained in the statutes of each such withdrawing Member State, solely to each chief executive officer of each remaining Member State, giving notice of such withdrawal.

Section 8. Cooperation. The Commission, Member States and Compact Administrator shall cooperate with each other and give each other mutual assistance in enforcing this Compact and shall give the chief law enforcement officer of each other Member State any information or documents that are reasonably necessary to facilitate the enforcement of this Compact.

Upon expiration of such term, any person formerly serving as a delegate must immediately withdraw from and cease participation at the Convention, if any is proceeding.

Section 6. Delegate Authority. The power and authority of any delegate appointed hereunder is strictly limited: (a) to introducing, debating, voting upon, proposing and enforcing the Convention Rules specified in this Compact, as needed to ensure those rules govern the Convention; and (b) to introducing, debating, voting upon, and rejecting or proposing for ratification the Balanced Budget Amendment.

A certified chaptered conforming copy of this Compact, together with government-issued photographic proof of identification, shall suffice as credentials for delegates of Member States.

Section 1. To the extent that the effectiveness of this Compact or any of its Articles or provisions requires the alteration of local legislative rules, drafting policies, or procedure to be effective, the enactment of legislation enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound by this Compact shall be deemed to waive, repeal, supersede, or otherwise amend and conform all such rules, policies or procedures to allow for the effectiveness of this Compact to the fullest extent permitted by the constitution of any affected Member State.

Section 2. Date and Location of the Convention. Unless otherwise specified by Congress in its call, the Convention shall be held in Dallas, Texas and commence proceedings at 9:00 a.m. Central Standard Time on the sixth Wednesday after the latter of the effective date of Article V of this Compact or the enactment date of the Congressional resolution calling the Convention.

Section 3. In addition to all other powers and duties conferred by state law which are consistent with the terms and conditions of this Compact, the chief law enforcement officer of each Member State is empowered to defend the Compact from any legal challenge, as well as to seek civil mandatory and prohibitory injunctive relief to enforce this Compact; and shall take such action whenever the Compact is challenged or violated.

Section 4. The exclusive venue for all actions in any way arising under this Compact shall be in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas or the courts of the State of Texas within the jurisdictional boundaries of the foregoing district court. Each Member State shall submit to the jurisdiction of said courts with respect to such actions. However, upon written request by the chief law enforcement officer of any Member State, the Commission may elect to waive this provision for the purpose of ensuring an action proceeds in the venue that allows for the most convenient and effective enforcement or defense of this Compact. Any such waiver shall be limited to the particular action to which it is applied and not construed or relied upon as a general waiver of this provision. The waiver decisions of the Commission under this provision shall be final and binding on each Member State.

Section 5. The effective date of this Compact and any of its Articles is the latter of: (a) the date of any event rendering the same effective according to its respective terms and conditions; or (b) the earliest date otherwise permitted by law.

However, if any other phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact, or the applicability of any other phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact to any government, agency, person or circumstance, is declared in a final judgment to be contrary to the Constitution of the United States, contrary to the state constitution of any Member State, or is otherwise held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such phrase, clause, sentence or provision shall be severed and held for naught, and the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability of the remainder of this Compact to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected. Furthermore, if this Compact is declared in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to be entirely contrary to the state constitution of any Member State or otherwise entirely invalid as to any Member State, such Member State shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the Compact, and the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to any remaining Member State. Finally, if this Compact is declared in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to be wholly or substantially in violation of Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution of the United States, then it shall be construed and enforced solely as reciprocal legislation enacted by the affected Member State(s).

Section 7. Termination. This Compact shall terminate and be held for naught when the Compact is fully performed and the Constitution of the United States is amended by the Balanced Budget Amendment. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Compact, in the event such amendment does not occur within seven (7) years after the first State passes legislation enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound to this Compact, the Compact shall terminate as follows: (a) the Commission shall dissolve and wind up its operations within ninety (90) days thereafter, with the Compact Administrator giving notice of such dissolution and the operative effect of this section to the Compact Notice Recipients; and (b) upon the completed dissolution of the Commission, this Compact shall be deemed terminated, repealed, void ab initio, and held for naught.
