If the commission determines that the reclassification, as amended or conditioned if appropriate, meets applicable standards under the state constitution and commission regulations, meets the standards for incorporation under AS 29.05.011 for the class of city proposed in the reclassification petition, and is in the best interests of the state, it may accept the petition. Otherwise, it shall reject the petition. The commission shall notify the city of its decision. The decision may be appealed under AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act).

(b) A petition proposing reclassification may be filed by

(1) a number of voters equal to 15 percent of the number of votes cast in the city at the preceding regular election; or

###### Sec. 29.04.050.   Reclassification of second class boroughs.

A second class borough may reclassify as a first class borough in the manner provided by AS 29.35.320§29.35.330 for the addition of an areawide power by a first or second class borough, except the petition or proposal requests reclassification instead of requesting addition of a power.

###### Sec. 29.04.060.   Reclassification of third class boroughs.

(a) A third class borough may reclassify as a first or second class borough in the manner provided by AS 29.35.320§29.35.330 for the addition of an areawide power by a first or second class borough, except the petition or proposal requests reclassification instead of requesting addition of a power. At the time of voting on reclassification of a third class borough to first or second class status, voters shall vote also on whether the borough shall, on reclassification, retain a combined assembly and school board or elect a separate assembly and board as otherwise provided for first and second class boroughs.

(b) If a combined assembly and school board are approved at the reclassification election, the assembly serving at the time of the election continues to serve as the assembly and board on voter approval of reclassification and until terms of assembly members expire as provided before reclassification.

(c) If a separate assembly and school board are approved at the reclassification election, a school board shall be elected in conformity with AS 14.12.030§14.12.100 at the next regular election, if it occurs within 90 days of the date of the reclassification election, or otherwise at a special election within 90 days of the date of the reclassification election.

###### Sec. 29.05.100.   Decision.

(a) After providing public notice of each proposed amendment or condition and an opportunity for public comment, the Local Boundary Commission may amend the petition and may impose conditions on the incorporation. If the commission determines that the incorporation, as amended or conditioned if appropriate, meets applicable standards under the state constitution and commission regulations, meets the standards for incorporation under AS 29.05.011 or 29.05.031, and is in the best interests of the state, it may accept the petition.

The municipality may impose an enhanced 911 surcharge within the enhanced 911 service area. An enhanced 911 surcharge may not exceed $2 per month for each wireless telephone number and $2 per month for each local exchange access line for wireline telephones. The maximum surcharge amount of $2 provided for in this subsection may be increased above that level if the surcharge amount is approved by the voters of the enhanced 911 service area. The amount of surcharge imposed for each wireless telephone number must equal the amount imposed for each local exchange access line for a wireline telephone. An enhanced 911 service area may be all of a city, all of a unified municipality, or all or part of the area within a borough and may include the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality in accordance with AS 29.35.020. The governing body of a municipality shall review an enhanced 911 surcharge annually to determine whether the current level of the surcharge is adequate, excessive, or insufficient to meet anticipated enhanced 911 system needs.

(c) A local exchange telephone company or wireless telephone company shall include the appropriate enhanced 911 surcharge, stated separately and included in the total amount owed, in the bills delivered to its customers. The Regulatory Commission of Alaska may not consider the enhanced 911 surcharge as revenue of the telephone company and has no jurisdiction over an enhanced 911 system. A customer is liable for payment of the enhanced 911 surcharge in the amounts billed by the telephone company until the amounts have been paid to the telephone company.

(d) A local exchange telephone company or wireless telephone company that has collected the enhanced 911 surcharge shall remit the amounts collected to the municipality no later than 60 days after the end of the month in which the amount was collected. From each remittance made in a timely manner under this subsection, the telephone company is entitled to deduct and retain the greater of one percent of the collected amount or $150 as the cost of administration for collecting the enhanced 911 surcharge. In addition, a wireless telephone company is entitled to full recovery of the recurring and nonrecurring costs associated with implementation and operation of Phase I E911 service as allowed under Federal Communications Commission proceedings entitled "Revision of the Commission's Rules to Ensure Compatibility with Enhanced 9-1-1 Emergency Calling Systems" (CC Docket No. 94-102; RM-8143).

However, if a telephone company is attempting to collect an unpaid debt from a customer, the telephone company shall also attempt to collect any unpaid enhanced 911 surcharge that the customer owes. If a customer pays a portion of a bill that includes an enhanced 911 surcharge, the amount paid shall be prorated between the telephone company and the enhanced 911 surcharge. The telephone company shall annually provide the municipality with a list of the amounts due for the nonpayment of enhanced 911 surcharges, together with the names and addresses of those customers who carry a balance that can be determined by the telephone company to be for the nonpayment of the enhanced 911 surcharges. The telephone company is not liable for uncollected amounts.

If used by nonprofit educational groups, the property is exempt only if used exclusively for classroom space.

(d) Laws exempting certain property from execution under AS 09 (Code of Civil Procedure) do not exempt the property from taxes levied and collected by municipalities.

(e) The real property owned and occupied as the primary residence and permanent place of abode by a resident who is (1) 65 years of age or older; (2) a disabled veteran; or (3) at least 60 years of age and the widow or widower of a person who qualified for an exemption under (1) or (2) of this subsection is exempt from taxation on the first $150,000 of the assessed value of the real property. A municipality may by ordinance approved by the voters grant the exemption under this subsection to the widow or widower under 60 years of age of a person who qualified for an exemption under (2) of this subsection or to a resident who is the widow or widower of a person who dies from a service-connected cause sustained while serving as a member of the United States armed forces or as a member of the National Guard. A municipality may, in case of hardship, provide for exemption beyond the first $150,000 of assessed value in accordance with regulations of the department. Only one exemption may be granted for the same property, and, if two or more persons are eligible for an exemption for the same property, the parties shall decide between or among themselves who is to receive the benefit of the exemption. Real property may not be exempted under this subsection if the assessor determines, after notice and hearing to the parties, that the property was conveyed to the applicant primarily for the purpose of obtaining the exemption. The determination of the assessor may be appealed under AS 44.62.560§44.62.570. A municipality shall determine the eligibility requirements and application procedure for an optional exemption provided under this subsection. In this subsection, "widow or widower" means a person whose spouse has died and who has not remarried.

(f) To be eligible for an exemption under (e) of this section for a year, a municipality may by ordinance require that an individual also meet requirements under one of the following paragraphs: (1) the individual shall be eligible for a permanent fund dividend under AS 43.23.005 for that same year or for the immediately preceding year; or (2) if the individual has not applied or does not apply for one or both of the permanent fund dividends, the individual would have been eligible for one of the permanent fund dividends identified in (1) of this subsection had the individual applied. An exemption may not be granted under (e) of this section except upon written application for the exemption. Each municipality shall, by ordinance, establish procedures and deadlines for filing the application. The governing body of the municipality for good cause shown may waive the claimant's failure to make timely application for exemption and authorize the assessor to accept the application as if timely filed. If an application is filed within the required time and is approved by the assessor, the assessor shall allow an exemption in accordance with the provisions of (e) of this section. If the application for exemption is approved after taxes have been paid, the amount of tax that the claimant has already paid for the property exempted shall be refunded to the claimant. The assessor shall require proof in the form the assessor considers necessary of the right to and amount of an exemption claimed under (e) of this section, and shall require a disabled veteran claiming an exemption under (e) of this section to provide evidence of the disability rating. The assessor may require proof under this subsection at any time.

(g) The state shall reimburse a borough or city, as appropriate, for the real property tax revenues lost to it by the operation of (e) of this section.  However, reimbursement may be made to a municipality for revenue lost to it only to the extent that the loss exceeds an exemption that was granted by the municipality, or that on proper application by an individual would have been granted under AS 29.45.050(a).  If appropriations are not sufficient to fully fund reimbursements under this subsection, the amount available shall be distributed pro rata among eligible municipalities.

(h) Except as provided in (g) of this section, nothing in (e)§(j) of this section affects similar exemptions from property taxes granted by a municipality on September 10, 1972, or prevents a municipality from granting similar exemptions by ordinance as provided in AS 29.45.050.

(i) In (e)§(i) of this section,

(1) "disabled veteran" means a disabled person

(A) separated from the military service of the United States under a condition that is not dishonorable who is a resident of the state, whose disability was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty in the military service of the United States, and whose disability has been rated as 50 percent or more by the branch of service in which that person served or by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs; or

(B) who served in the Alaska Territorial Guard, who is a resident of the state, whose disability was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while serving in the Alaska Territorial Guard, and whose disability has been rated as 50 percent or more;

(2) "real property" includes but is not limited to mobile homes, whether classified as real or personal property for municipal tax purposes.

(j) One motor vehicle per household owned by a resident 65 years of age or older on January 1 of the assessment year is exempt either from taxation on its assessed value or from the registration tax under AS 28.10.431. An exemption may be granted under this subsection only upon written application on a form prescribed by the Department of Administration.

(k) The department shall adopt regulations to implement the provisions of (g) and (j) of this section.

(l) [Repealed,§8, ch. 9, SLA 2017.]

(m) For the purpose of determining property exempt under (a)(7)(A) of this section, the following definitions apply to terms used in 43 U.S.C. 1620(d) unless superseded by applicable federal law, and for the purpose of determining property exempt under (a)(7)(B) of this section, the following definitions apply:

(1) "developed" means a purposeful modification of the property from its original state that effectuates a condition of gainful and productive present use without further substantial modification; surveying, construction of roads, providing utilities or other similar actions normally considered to be component parts of the development process, but that do not create the condition described in this paragraph, do not constitute a developed state within the meaning of this paragraph; developed property, in order to remove the exemption, must be developed for purposes other than exploration, and be limited to the smallest practicable tract of the property actually used in the developed state;

(2) "exploration" means the examination and investigation of undeveloped land to determine the existence of subsurface nonrenewable resources;

(3) "lease" means a grant of primary possession entered into for gainful purposes with a determinable fee remaining in the hands of the grantor; with respect to a lease that conveys rights of exploration and development, this exemption shall continue with respect to that portion of the leased tract that is used solely for the purpose of exploration.

(n) If property or an interest in property that is determined not to be exempt under (a)(7) of this section reverts to an undeveloped state, or if the lease is terminated, the exemption shall be granted, subject to the provisions of (a)(7) and (m) of this section.

###### Sec. 29.45.040.   Property tax equivalency payments.

(a) A resident of the state who rents a permanent place of abode is eligible for a tax equivalency payment from the state through the department if the resident is

(1) at least 65 years old;

(2) a disabled veteran; or

(3) at least 60 years old and the widow or widower of a person who was eligible for payment under (1) or (2) of this subsection.

(b) For purposes of determining the amount of a payment to an eligible person, the department shall calculate at the rate of one percent per mill a property tax equivalent percentage for each municipality that levies a property tax. The property tax equivalent percentage applied to the annual rent charged to the applicant equals the property tax equivalency payment payable under this section.

(c) To obtain a tax equivalency payment the eligible resident must apply to the department for payment for the preceding year by January 15 of each year on forms and in the manner prescribed by the department.  The department for good cause shown may waive an applicant's failure to make timely application for a tax equivalency payment and accept the application as if timely filed.  Each applicant shall submit with the application rental receipts or, if rental receipts are not available, other evidence satisfactory to the department for determination of the fact of payment of rent and the amount paid. A disabled veteran shall submit with the application evidence of the disability rating.

(d) If two or more persons occupy a residence as tenants, not all of whom are eligible for a tax equivalency payment under this section, the assessor shall determine equitable partial payments to be made to the eligible tenants. However, a tax equivalency payment to an eligible applicant may not be reduced because the spouse is less than 65 years of age or is not a disabled veteran.  If all occupants in a residence are eligible for a tax equivalency payment under this section, the occupants shall decide between and among themselves which shall receive payment.

(e) If appropriations are not sufficient to fully fund tax equivalency payments under this section, the amount available shall be distributed pro rata among eligible residents.

(f) In this section, "disabled veteran" has the meaning given in AS 29.45.030(i).

###### Sec. 29.45.045.   Reimbursement payments. [Repealed,§6 ch 70 SLA 1986.]

###### Sec. 29.45.046.   River habitat protection tax credit.

(a) Unless prohibited by municipal charter, a municipality may by ordinance provide for a river habitat protection credit to be applied to offset a portion of the property taxes due on land, or an interest in land taxable under this chapter, upon which an improvement has been constructed that aids in

(1) protecting a river from degradation of fish habitat due to public or private use; or

(2) restoring riparian fish habitat along or in a river that has been damaged by land use practices.

(b) The amount of a river habitat protection credit shall be based upon a percentage of the verifiable costs of the improvement and may not exceed 50 percent of the total amount of taxes levied upon the land or upon the taxable interest in the land during a single tax year, but the credit may be granted for more than one year. If the credit is granted for more than one year and the land or taxable interest in the land is conveyed, the portion of the credit remaining is extinguished. The ordinance may limit the availability of a credit to some, but not all types of improvements for which a credit may be granted under this section and to some, but not all areas of the municipality. A credit may only be granted for an improvement that has been constructed in compliance with state and federal laws. A credit may not be granted for an improvement

(1) required under state or federal law; or

(2) located more than 150 feet from the mean high tide line or ordinary high water line; in this paragraph, "ordinary high water line" means that line on the shore of the nontidal portion of a river or stream that reflects the highest level of water during an ordinary year and is established by fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding area.

(c)  [Repealed,§3 ch 41 SLA 1995.]

(d) Before an ordinance is adopted under (a) of this section, it must be approved by the commissioner of fish and game. The commissioner of fish and game shall approve a proposed ordinance if the improvements for which a credit is authorized aid in protecting or restoring habitat as required under this section without regard to the percentage of the total protection or restoration that could be achieved by ideal improvement measures. Within 60 days after receipt of a proposed ordinance, the commissioner of fish and game shall notify the municipality in writing as to whether the proposed ordinance is approved or disapproved and, if the proposed ordinance is disapproved, shall state the basis for that determination.

###### Sec. 29.45.047.   Air quality improvement tax credit.

A municipality may by ordinance provide for a single or multiple year air quality improvement tax credit to offset a portion of the property taxes due on real property improvements made during the immediately preceding tax year before the municipality's initial approval of the tax credit, including new construction, refurbishments, remodels, and renovations that aid in improving the air quality in the municipality. The municipality shall establish eligibility criteria for the credit in the ordinance adopted under this section.

###### Sec. 29.45.048.   Air quality improvement tax credit. [Repealed,§2, ch. 26, SLA 2009.]

###### Sec. 29.45.049.   Energy efficient construction tax credit.

A municipality may by ordinance provide for a single or multiple year energy efficient construction tax credit to offset a portion of the property taxes due on real property improvements made during the immediately preceding tax year before the municipality's initial approval of the tax credit, including energy efficient new construction, refurbishments, remodels, and renovations. The municipality shall establish eligibility criteria for the credit in the ordinance adopted under this section.

###### Sec. 29.45.050.   Optional exemptions and exclusions.

(a) A municipality may exclude or exempt or partially exempt residential property from taxation by ordinance ratified by the voters at an election. An exclusion or exemption authorized by this subsection may be applied with respect to taxes levied in a service area to fund the special services. An exclusion or exemption authorized by this subsection may not exceed the assessed value of $75,000 for any one residence except that a municipality may, by ordinance, annually adjust the municipality's voter-authorized exemption by the amount calculated by the State Assessor to reflect the increase, if any, in the annual average cost of living, using the United States Department of Labor Consumer Price Index for Urban Alaska.

(b) A municipality may by ordinance

(1) classify and exempt from taxation

(A) the property of an organization not organized for business or profit-making purposes and used exclusively for community purposes if the income derived from rental of that property does not exceed the actual cost to the owner of the use by the renter;

(B) historic sites, buildings, and monuments;

(C) land of a nonprofit organization used for agricultural purposes if rights to subdivide the land are conveyed to the state and the conveyance includes a covenant restricting use of the land to agricultural purposes only; rights conveyed to the state under this subparagraph may be conveyed by the state only in accordance with AS 38.05.069(c);

(D) all or any portion of private ownership interests in property that, based upon a written agreement with the University of Alaska, is used exclusively for student housing for the University of Alaska; property may be exempted from taxation under this subparagraph for no longer than 30 years unless the exemption is specifically extended by ordinance adopted within the six months before the expiration of that period;

(2) classify as to type and exempt or partially exempt some or all types of personal property from ad valorem taxes.

(c) The provisions of (a) of this section notwithstanding,

(1) a borough may, by ordinance, adjust its property tax structure in whole or in part to the property tax structure of a city in the borough, including adjustments excluding personal property from taxation, establishing exemptions, and extending the redemption period;

(2) a home rule or first class city has the same power to grant exemptions or exclude property from borough taxes that it has as to city taxes if

(A) the exemptions or exclusions have been adopted as to city taxes; and

(B) the city appropriates to the borough sufficient money to equal revenue lost by the borough because of the exemptions or exclusions, the amount to be determined annually by the assembly;

(3) a city in a borough may, by ordinance, adjust its property tax structure in whole or in part to the property tax structure of the borough, including exempting or partially exempting property from taxation.

(d) Exemptions or exclusions from property tax that have been granted by a home rule municipality in addition to exemptions authorized or required by law, and that are in effect on September 10, 1972, and not later withdrawn, are not affected by this chapter.

(e) A municipality may by ordinance classify and exempt or partially exempt from taxation privately owned land, wet land and water areas for which a scenic, conservation, or public recreation use easement is granted to a governmental body. To be eligible for a tax exemption, or partial exemption, the easement must be in perpetuity. The easement is automatically terminated before an eminent domain taking of fee simple title or less than fee simple title to the property, so that the property owner is compensated at a rate that does not reflect the easement grant. The municipality may provide by ordinance that, if the area subject to the easement is sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of for uses incompatible with the easement or if the easement is conveyed to the owner of the property, the owner must pay to the municipality all or a portion of the amount of the tax exempted, with interest.

(f) A municipality may by ordinance exempt from taxation all or part of the increase in assessed value of improvements to real property if an increase in assessed value is directly attributable to alteration of the natural features of the land, or new maintenance, repair, or renovation of an existing structure, and if the alteration, maintenance, repair, or renovation, when completed, enhances the exterior appearance or aesthetic quality of the land or structure. An exemption may not be allowed under this subsection for the construction of an improvement to a structure if the principal purpose of the improvement is to increase the amount of space for occupancy or nonresidential use in the structure or for the alteration of land as a consequence of construction activity. An exemption provided in this subsection may continue for up to four years from the date the improvement is completed, or from the date of approval for the exemption by the local assessor, whichever is later.

(g) A municipality may by ordinance exempt from taxation all or part of the increase in assessed value of improvements to a single-family dwelling if the principal purpose of the improvement is to increase the amount of space for occupancy. An exemption provided in this subsection may continue for up to two years from the date the improvement is completed, or from the date of approval of an application for the exemption by the local assessor, whichever is later.

(h) A municipality may by ordinance partially or wholly exempt land from a tax for fire protection service and fire protection facilities and may levy the tax only on improvements, including personal property affixed to the improvements.

(i) A municipality may by ordinance approved by the voters exempt from taxation the assessed value that exceeds $150,000 of real property owned and occupied as a permanent place of abode by a resident who is

(1) 65 years of age or older;

(2) a disabled veteran, including a person who was disabled in the line of duty while serving in the Alaska Territorial Guard; or

(3) at least 60 years old and a widow or widower of a person who qualified for an exemption under (1) or (2) of this subsection.

(j) A municipality may by ordinance approved by the voters exempt real or personal property in a taxing unit used in processing timber after it has been delivered to the processing site from up to 75 percent of the rate of taxes levied on other property in that taxing unit. An ordinance adopted under this subsection may not provide for an exemption that exceeds five years in duration. In this subsection, "taxing unit" means a municipality and includes

(1) a service area in a unified municipality or borough;

(2) the entire area outside cities in a borough; and

(3) a differential tax zone in a city.

(k) A municipality may by ordinance approved by the voters exempt from taxation pollution control facilities that meet requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Environmental Conservation. An ordinance adopted under this subsection may not provide for an exemption that exceeds five years in duration.

(l) A municipality may by ordinance exempt from taxation an interest, other than record ownership, in real property of an individual residing in the property if the property has been developed, improved, or acquired with federal funds for low-income housing and is owned or managed as low-income housing by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation under AS 18.55.100§18.55.960 or by a regional housing authority formed under AS 18.55.996. However, the corporation may make payments to the municipality or political subdivision for improvements, services, and facilities furnished by it for the benefit of a housing project, and this subsection does not prohibit a municipality from receiving those payments or any payments in lieu of taxes authorized under federal law.

(m) A municipality may by ordinance partially or totally exempt all or some types of economic development property from taxation for a designated period. Except as otherwise provided by an ordinance enacted by the municipality before January 1, 2017, a municipality that is a school district may only exempt all or a portion of the amount of taxes that exceeds the amount levied on other property for the school district's required local contribution under AS 14.17.410(b)(2). A municipality may by ordinance permit deferral of payment of taxes on all or some types of economic development property for a designated period. A municipality may apply an exemption or deferral under this subsection to taxes levied for special services in a service area that is supervised by  an elected service area  board under AS 29.35.460 unless the elected service area board objects to the exemption or deferral by resolution adopted not later than 60 days after the effective date of the municipal ordinance enacting the tax exemption or deferral. A municipality may adopt an ordinance under this subsection only if, before it is adopted, copies of the proposed ordinance made available at a public hearing on it contain written notice that the ordinance, if adopted, may be repealed by the voters through referendum. An ordinance adopted under this subsection must include specific eligibility requirements and require a written application for each exemption or deferral.

(n) A municipality may by ordinance classify as to type inventories intended for export outside the state and partially or totally exempt all or some types of those inventories from taxation. The ordinance may provide for different levels of exemption for different classifications of inventories. An ordinance adopted under this subsection must include specific eligibility requirements and require a written application, which shall be a public document, for each exemption.

(o) A municipality may by ordinance partially or totally exempt all or some types of deteriorated property from taxation for up to 10 years beginning on or any time after the day substantial rehabilitation, renovation, demolition, removal, or replacement of any structure on the property begins. A municipality may by ordinance permit deferral of payment of taxes on all or some types of deteriorated property for up to five years beginning on or any time after the day substantial rehabilitation, renovation, demolition, removal, or replacement of any structure on the property begins. However, if the entire ownership of property for which a deferral has been granted is transferred, all tax payments deferred under this subsection are immediately due, and the deferral ends. Otherwise, deferred tax payments become due as specified by the municipality at the time the deferral is granted. The amount deferred each year is a lien on that property for that year. Only one exemption and only one deferral may be granted to the same property under this subsection, and, if an exemption and a deferral are granted to the same property, both may not be in effect on the same portion of the property during the same time. An ordinance adopted under this subsection must include specific eligibility requirements and require a written application for each exemption or deferral. An application for a deferral must specify when payment of taxes for each year of deferral will become due, together with an explanation of the reasons for each proposed date for consideration by the municipality. In this subsection, "deteriorated property" means real property that, either at the time of application for exemption or deferral or at the time of completion of the project for which an exemption or deferral is requested, is

(1) residential property located in a deteriorating or deteriorated area with boundaries that have been determined by the municipality, if the property is owned by an entity that owns at least two residential properties and eight or more residential units among those properties in that deteriorating or deteriorated area; or

(2) commercial property not used for residential purposes or that is multi-unit residential property with at least eight residential units, and that meets one of the following requirements:

(A) within the last five years, has been the subject of an order by a government agency requiring environmental remediation of the property or requiring the property to be vacated, condemned, or demolished by reason of noncompliance with laws, ordinances, or regulations;

(B) has a structure on it not less than 15 years of age that has not undergone substantial rehabilitation, renovation, demolition, removal, or replacement, subject to any conditions prescribed in the ordinance; or

(C) is located in a deteriorating or deteriorated area with boundaries that have been determined by the municipality.

(p) A municipality may by ordinance partially or totally exempt from taxation a private leasehold, contract, or other interest held by or through an applicant or proposed applicant in any property, assets, project, or development project owned by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority under AS 44.88. Nothing in this subsection prohibits a municipality from entering into an agreement and receiving payments in lieu of taxes authorized under AS 44.88.140(b).

(q) A municipality may by ordinance partially or totally exempt from taxation land from which timber is harvested that is infested by insects or at risk of being infested by insects due to an infestation in the area in which the land is located. A municipality may provide that an exemption for land under this subsection applies only to increases in assessed value that result from the timber harvest. A municipality may by ordinance partially or totally exempt from taxation improvements to real property, including personal property affixed to the improvements, if the improvements are

(1) located on land from which timber is harvested that is infested by insects or at risk of being infested by insects due to an infestation in the area in which the land is located; and

(2) used for or necessary to the harvest of the timber that is infested by insects or in danger of insect infestation.

(r) A municipality may by ordinance exempt from taxation an amount not to exceed $10,000 of the assessed value of real property owned and occupied as a permanent place of abode by a resident who provides in the municipality volunteer (1) fire fighting services and is certified as a firefighter by the Department of Public Safety, or (2) emergency medical services or mobile intensive care paramedic services and is certified or licensed under AS 18.08.082. If two or more individuals are eligible for an exemption for the same property, not more than two exemptions may be granted.

(b) An assessment or reassessment under this section may be made by the assessor only upon the receipt of a sworn statement of the taxpayer that losses exceed $1,000. A reduction of taxes may be made only on losses in excess of $1,000 for the remainder of the year following the disaster.  On reassessment, the municipality shall recompute this tax and refund taxes that have already been paid.

(c) The municipality shall give notice of assessment or reassessment under this section and shall hold an equalization hearing as provided in this chapter, except that a notice of appeal must be filed with the board of equalization within 10 days after notice of assessment or reassessment is given to the person appealing.

A penalty under this section may be imposed according to a formula that increases the amount of the penalty as the length of time increases during which payment is delinquent or assessment forms are not returned.

(b) If a taxpayer is given the right to pay the tax in two installments, penalty and interest on an unpaid installment accrues from the date the installment becomes due.

#### Article 2. Enforcement of Tax Liens.

###### Sec. 29.45.310.   Enforcement of personal property tax liens by distraint and sale.

(a) A lien for personal property taxes may be enforced by distraint and sale of the property. The municipality shall provide the procedure for distraint and sale by ordinance.  A seizure, levy, or distraint is not legal unless demand is first made of the person assessed for the amount of the tax, penalty, and interest, and a sale is not valid unless made at public auction no sooner than 15 days after notice is published.  The seizure is made by virtue of a warrant issued by the municipal clerk to a peace officer.

(b) If the personal property sold is not sufficient to satisfy the tax, penalty, and interest, and costs of sale, the warrant may authorize the seizure of other personal property sufficient to satisfy the tax, penalty, interest, and costs of sale.  If the property is sold for more money than is needed to satisfy the tax, the municipality shall remit the excess to the former record owner upon presentation of a proper claim.  A claim for the excess filed after six months of the date of sale is forever barred.

###### Sec. 29.45.340.   Clearing delinquencies.

During the publication or posting of the foreclosure list and up to the time of transfer to the municipality a person may pay the taxes, together with the penalty, interest, and costs. The collector shall note payment on the foreclosure list.

A person having an interest in a lot on the foreclosure list may file an answer within 30 days after the date of last publication, specifying the person's objection.  The court shall make its decision in summary proceedings. The foreclosure list is prima facie evidence that the assessment and levy of the tax is valid and that the tax is unpaid.

###### Sec. 29.45.380.   Judgment.

The court shall in a proper case give judgment and decree that the tax liens be foreclosed.  It is a several judgment against each lot and a lien on each lot.

###### Sec. 29.45.390.   Transfer and appeal.

(a) Foreclosed properties are transferred to the municipality for the lien amount.  When answers are filed the court may enter judgment against and order the transfer to the municipality of all other properties on the list pending determination of the matters in controversy.  The court shall hear and determine the issues raised by the complaint and answers in the same manner and under the same rules as it hears and determines other actions.

(b) The court clerk shall deliver a certified copy of the judgment and decree to the municipal clerk. The certified judgment and decree constitutes a transfer to the municipality.

(c) The judgment and decree stops objections to it that could have been presented before judgment and decree. Appeal from a judgment and decree of foreclosure, or from a final order in the proceeding, may be taken in a manner provided for appeals in civil actions.

###### Sec. 29.45.400.   Redemption period.

Properties transferred to the municipality are held by the municipality for at least one year. During the redemption period a party having an interest in the property may redeem it by paying the lien amount plus penalties, interest, and costs, including all costs incurred under AS 29.45.440(a). Property redeemed is subject to all accrued taxes, assessments, liens, and claims as though it had continued in private ownership. Only the amount applicable under the judgment and decree must be paid in order to redeem the property.

###### Sec. 29.45.410.   Effect.

Receipt of redemption money by the municipality releases the judgment obtained under AS 29.45.380. The clerk or the clerk's designee shall record the redemption and issue a certificate containing a property description, the redemption amount, and the dates of judgment and decree of foreclosure.  The clerk or the clerk's designee shall collect the recording fee at the time of redemption and shall file the certificate with the record as part of the judgment roll.

###### Sec. 29.45.420.   Additional liens.

If a property included in a foreclosure list is removed after payment of delinquencies or redemption by another lienholder, the payment represented by receipt for payment constitutes an additional lien on the property, collectible by the lienholder in the same manner as the original lien.

###### Sec. 29.45.430.   Possession during redemption period.

Foreclosure does not affect the former owner's right to possession during the redemption period.  If waste is committed by the former owner or by anyone acting under the permission or control of the former owner, the municipality may declare an immediate forfeiture of the right to possession.

###### Sec. 29.45.440.   Expiration.

(a) At least 30 days before the expiration of the redemption period the clerk or the clerk's designee shall publish a redemption period expiration notice.

The notice appears once a week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation distributed in the municipality.  If there is no newspaper of general circulation distributed in the municipality, the notice is posted in three public places for at least four consecutive weeks.  The clerk shall send a copy of the notice by certified mail to each record owner of property against which a judgment of foreclosure has been taken and, if the assessed value of the property is more than $10,000, to all holders of mortgages or other liens of record on the property.  The notice shall be mailed within five days after the first publication.  The mailing shall be sufficient if mailed to the property owner and to the holder of a mortgage or recorded lien at the last address of record.

(b) The right of redemption expires 30 days after the date of the first notice publication.

(c) Costs incurred in the determination of holders of mortgages and other liens of record and costs of notice publication incurred by a municipality under (a) of this section are a lien on the property and may be recovered by the municipality.

###### Sec. 29.45.450.   Deed to borough or city.

(a) Unredeemed property in the area of the borough outside all cities is deeded to the borough by the clerk of the court. Unredeemed property in a city is deeded to the city subject to the payment by the city of unpaid borough taxes and costs of foreclosure levied against the property before foreclosure. The deed shall be recorded in the recording district in which the property is located.

(b) Conveyance gives the municipality clear title, except for prior recorded tax liens of the United States and the state.

(c) If unredeemed property lies in a city and if the city has no immediate public use for the property but the borough does have an immediate public use, the city shall deed the property to the borough.  If unredeemed property lies in the borough outside all cities and if the borough does not have an immediate public use for the property but a city does have an immediate public use, the borough shall deed the property to the city.

(d) A deed is not invalid for irregularities, omissions, or defects in the proceedings under this chapter unless the former owner has been misled so as to be injured.  Two years after the date of the deed, its validity is conclusively presumed and a claim of the former owner or other person having an interest in the property is forever barred.

###### Sec. 29.45.460.   Disposition and sale of foreclosed property.

(a) The municipality shall determine by ordinance whether foreclosed property deeded to the municipality shall be retained for a public purpose.  The ordinance must contain the legal description of the property, the address or a general description of the property sufficient to provide the public with notice of its location, and the name of the last record owner of the property as the name appears on the assessment rolls.

(b) Tax-foreclosed property conveyed to a municipality by tax foreclosure and not required for a public purpose may be sold.  Before the sale of tax-foreclosed property held for a public purpose, the municipality, by ordinance, shall determine that a public need does not exist.  The ordinance must contain the information required under (a) of this section.

(c) The clerk or the clerk's designee shall send a copy of the published notice of hearing of an ordinance to consider a determination required under (a) or (b) of this section by certified mail to the former record owner of the property that is the subject of the ordinance.  The notice shall be mailed within five days after its first publication and shall be sufficient if mailed to the last record owner of the property as the name appears on the assessment rolls of the municipality.

(d) The provisions of (c) of this section do not apply with respect to property that has been held by the municipality for a period of more than 10 years after the close of the redemption period.

The municipality shall sell the property for the full amount applicable to the property under the judgment and decree plus

(1) interest not to exceed 15 percent a year from the date of entry of the judgment of foreclosure to the date of repurchase;

(2) delinquent taxes assessed and levied as though it had continued in private ownership;

(3) costs of foreclosure and sale incurred by the municipality; and

(4) costs of maintaining and managing the property incurred by the municipality including insurance, repairs, association dues, and management fees, that exceed amounts received by the municipality for the use of the property.

(b) After adoption of an ordinance providing for the retention of tax-foreclosed property by the municipality for a public purpose, the right of the former record owner to repurchase the property ceases.

###### Sec. 29.45.480.   Proceeds of tax sale.

(a) On sale of foreclosed real or personal property the municipality shall divide the proceeds less cost of collection between the borough and the city having unpaid taxes against the property. The division is in proportion to the respective municipal taxes against the property at the time of foreclosure.

(b) If tax-foreclosed real property that has been held by a municipality for less than 10 years after the close of the redemption period and never designated for a public purpose is sold at a tax-foreclosure sale, the former record owner is entitled to the portion of the proceeds of the sale that exceeds the amount of unpaid taxes, the amount equal to taxes that would have been assessed and levied after foreclosure if the property had continued in private ownership, penalty, interest, and costs to the municipality of foreclosing and selling the property, and costs to the municipality of maintaining and managing the property that exceed amounts received by the municipality for the use of the property. If the proceeds of the sale of tax-foreclosed property exceed the total of unpaid and delinquent taxes, penalty, interest, and costs, the municipality shall provide the former owner of the property written notice advising of the amount of the excess and the manner in which a claim for the balance of the proceeds may be submitted. Notice is sufficient under this subsection if mailed to the former record owner at the last address of record of the former record owner. On presentation of a proper claim, the municipality shall remit the excess to the former record owner. A claim for the excess filed after six months of the date of sale is forever barred.

###### Sec. 29.45.490.   Payment of taxes upon public utilization.

If a municipality takes title to tax-foreclosed property for a public purpose, the municipality shall satisfy unpaid taxes and assessments against the property held by other municipalities, with accrued interest but without penalty.  If the amount required to satisfy the unpaid taxes and assessments exceeds the assessed value of the property, the municipality shall pay the other municipalities the assessed value, which shall be divided between the other municipalities in proportion to their respective taxes and assessments against the property at the time of foreclosure.

###### Sec. 29.45.500.   Refund of taxes.

(a) If a taxpayer pays taxes under protest, the taxpayer may bring suit in the superior court against the municipality for recovery of the taxes.  If judgment for recovery is given against the municipality, or, if in the absence of suit, it becomes obvious to the governing body that judgment for recovery of the taxes would be obtained if legal proceedings were brought, the municipality shall refund the amount of the taxes to the taxpayer with interest at eight percent from the date of payment plus costs.

(b) If, in payment of taxes legally imposed, a remittance by a taxpayer through error or otherwise exceeds the amount due, and the municipality, on audit of the account in question, is satisfied that this is the case, the municipality shall refund the excess to the taxpayer with interest at eight percent from the date of payment.  A claim for refund filed one year after the due date of the tax is forever barred.

(c) The governing body may correct manifest clerical errors at any time.

A second class city may by referendum levy property taxes as provided for first class cities. However, levy of an ad valorem tax by a second class city may not exceed two percent of the assessed value of the property taxed, except that the limit does not apply to a levy necessary to avoid a default upon payment of principal and interest of bonded or other indebtedness that is secured by a pledge to levy ad valorem or other taxes without limit to meet debt payments.

The department may not make a community assistance payment to a Native village council unless the council waives immunity from suit for claims arising out of activities of the council related to the payment. A waiver of immunity from suit under this section must be on a form provided by the Department of Law. If there is no qualified incorporated nonprofit entity or Native village council in a reserve or community that is willing to receive the community assistance payment and use the payment on behalf of that reserve or community, the payment for that reserve or community may not be paid. Neither this section nor any action taken under it enlarges or diminishes the governmental authority or jurisdiction of a Native village council.

(a) The acreage of each municipality's land selections for which patent has been issued before July 1, 1978, shall be credited toward fulfillment of the entitlement of that municipality.

(b) All approved selections under former AS 29.18.190 and 29.18.200 for which patent has not been issued to a municipality on July 1, 1978, shall be reviewed by the director within nine months after July 1, 1978. Any approved selection of land that was vacant, unappropriated, unreserved land on the date of selection is valid as of the date of the approval under former AS 29.18.190, 29.18.200, 29.18.201, 29.18.202, and 29.18.203, and a patent shall be issued to the municipality within three months after approval by the director of a plat of survey. The acreage shall be credited toward fulfillment of the municipality's entitlement. A municipality is not entitled to receive patent under this chapter to more than its entitlement determined under AS 29.65.010§29.65.030. Any prior approval by the director of municipal selections for land that was not vacant, unappropriated, unreserved land on the date of selection shall be rescinded, and patent may not be issued except when disposal to a third party by sale or lease has occurred. Transfers of land to municipalities under this chapter are subject to AS 38.05.321. Classification actions as reflected on the land status records of the Department of Natural Resources are determinative of land classification status for purposes of this chapter.

(c) The director shall approve or disapprove each selection for patent within nine months of its selection by a municipality. Before a decision is issued, the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development shall review the selection and recommend approval or disapproval of it. The director may disapprove a selection only upon a finding that the public interest in retaining state ownership of the land outweighs the municipality's interest in obtaining the land. If the director determines that the public interest in land selected in satisfaction of an entitlement under AS 29.65.010(a)(13), (14), (15), or (16) can be adequately protected by issuing a patent that is subject to stipulations, conditions, or covenants, and if the municipality agrees to accept the land subject to those stipulations, conditions, or covenants, the director may approve a selection that would otherwise be disapproved and may issue the patent with the stipulations, conditions, or covenants agreed to by the municipality. A patent shall be issued to the municipality for land selected in satisfaction of a general grant land entitlement vested under AS 29.65.010-29.65.030 within three months after approval by the director of a plat of survey.

(d) Before disapproving a selection, the director shall notify the municipality in writing of the decision and set out reasons for it. The municipality may submit a written response within 30 days after receipt of the notice. Within 30 days after the period for responding has expired, the director shall affirm, modify, or reverse the decision and supply the municipality with written notice of that action. If the selection is disapproved, the municipality may file notice of an appeal with the director. The appeal shall be heard under procedures adopted by regulation of the Department of Natural Resources. Before reaching a decision on an appeal the Department of Natural Resources shall request the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development to review the matter and submit a recommendation. After reviewing the recommendation, a decision on the appeal shall be submitted by the Department of Natural Resources to the municipality in writing within 30 days after the notice of appeal was filed with the director. A municipality may appeal an adverse decision to the superior court under AS 44.62.560§44.62.570.

###### Sec. 29.65.060.   School and mental health land.

(a) If an entitlement determined under AS 29.65.010 or 29.65.020 results in a per capita entitlement for the municipality of less than one and one-half acre, the municipality may select vacant school or mental health land in the municipality in partial fulfillment of its land entitlement under this chapter. School or mental health land may be selected notwithstanding the fact that this land is not unappropriated and unreserved within the meaning of this chapter and under former AS 29.18.190 and 29.18.200, but each selection of school or mental health land by a municipality must be vacant, unappropriated, unreserved land as defined in this chapter, except that it need not be general grant land.

(b) The acreage of school, university, or mental health land, if any, in a municipality may not be included in the determination of entitlement under AS 29.65.010 or 29.65.020.

(c) Land conveyed under this section shall be credited against a municipality's remaining land entitlement under this chapter.

(d) Within six months after approval of a municipal selection of school or mental health land, the director shall identify state general grant land of approximately equal value to the land requested by the municipality and shall propose the replacement land for the concurrence of the appropriate board. If a proposal by the director is rejected by the board, the director shall meet with the board as often as necessary to determine the type and amount of equal value replacement land that would be required to obtain the board's concurrence, and shall propose the replacement land for consideration by the board.  The replacement land shall thereafter be managed for the purposes for which the land selected by the municipality was acquired by the Territory and State of Alaska.

(e) The notice provisions of AS 38.05.945 apply to the designation of other general grant land as school, university, or mental health land in replacement of land selected under this section. The provisions of AS 38.50 do not apply to designations under this section.

(f) For purposes of determining the per capita entitlement under (a) of this section, the population of a municipality shall be the population determined by the former commissioner of community and regional affairs under former AS 43.18.010 for the program year beginning July 1, 1978, for a municipality whose entitlement was determined under former AS 29.18.201 or 29.18.202.

(g) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, a municipality may not select school land or mental health land after October 4, 1985. Nothing in this section affects the legal rights of any person with regard to selections of school land or mental health land made by a municipality on or before October 4, 1985.

(h) To obtain replacement land for mental health land that was conveyed by the state to the municipality under former AS 29.18.190§29.18.200, former AS 29.18.201§29.18.202, or under this chapter, a municipality may reconvey to the state land that had been conveyed by the state to the municipality. When a municipality reconveys land to the state under this subsection, the municipality has the right to select an equal number of acres of replacement land. The municipality may exercise its right to select replacement land under this subsection only within two years of the date of the reconveyance of land to the state.

###### Sec. 29.65.070.   Selection and conveyance procedure.

(a) If land selected by a municipality is unsurveyed at the time of approval, the director shall survey, or may approve the municipality's survey of, the exterior boundaries of an approved selection without interior subdivision, and shall issue patent in terms of the exterior boundary survey.  The cost of the survey shall be borne by the municipality.  If land selected by a municipality has been surveyed at the time of its selection, the boundaries shall conform to the public land subdivisions established by the approved survey.

(b) The director may approve municipal selections of land that have been tentatively approved or patented to the state by the federal government but may not issue patent to a municipality until the land has first been patented to the state. After approval of a selection by the director, but before patent to a municipality, the municipality may execute conditional leases and make conditional sales only with the consent of the director. Conditional sales and conditional leases made before July 1, 1978, do not require the consent of the director.

(c) The commissioner of natural resources shall require that each selection be compact in form with its length not exceeding approximately four times its width. The restrictions on form may be waived by the commissioner based on land use, terrain, effect of the form of the selection on access to it and other parcels, and effect of the form of the selection on surveying and management costs to the state and the municipality.

(d) Nothing in this chapter affects a valid existing claim, location, or entry under the laws of the state or the United States whether for homestead, mineral, right-of-way, or other purposes. Nothing in this chapter affects the rights of an owner, claimant, locater, or entryman to the full use and enjoyment of the land so occupied.

Exchange procedures shall comply with applicable law and municipal ordinances. The notice and review provisions of AS 38.05.945 apply to exchanges of land under this section.  The provisions of AS 38.50 do not apply to exchanges of land under this section.

###### Sec. 29.65.100.   Public purpose and expansion needs.

(a) Consistent with the best interests of the state, if a municipality does not contain and cannot reasonably acquire sufficient nonfederal land within its boundaries to meet its legitimate needs for public or private settlement or development, it is the policy of the state to select federal land reasonably necessary to meet the needs of the municipality and to make the land selected available to the municipality under AS 38.05.810 or (b) of this section.

(b) The state may contract with a municipality to act as its agent in an auction of state land under applicable statutes. When a municipality acts as the agent of the state in an auction, the municipality may retain from the proceeds of the auction the capital and other expenses that the director determines to be necessary and reasonable.

(c) Nothing in this chapter limits or impairs the authority of the director to transfer land to municipalities, without limit or consideration, for public purposes in accordance with AS 38.05.810.  If there is a remaining entitlement of the municipality, land transferred under AS 38.05.810 shall be credited toward fulfillment of the entitlement.
