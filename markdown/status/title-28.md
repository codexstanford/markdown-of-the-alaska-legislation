###### Sec. 28.05.121.   Giving of notice.

When the Department of Public Safety or the Department of Administration is authorized or required to give notice under this title or regulations adopted under this title, unless a different method of giving notice is otherwise expressly provided, notice shall be given by a qualified person, either by personal delivery to the person to be notified or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the person at the address of the person as shown in the records of the appropriate department. The giving of notice by mail is considered complete upon the return of the receipt or upon return of the notice as undeliverable, refused, or unclaimed. Proof of the giving of notice in either manner may be made by the affidavit of the person giving the notice by personal delivery or by mail, naming the person to whom the notice was given and specifying the time, place, and manner of giving the notice.

###### Sec. 28.05.131.   Opportunity for hearing required.

(a) Unless otherwise specifically provided, or unless immediate action in suspending, revoking, canceling, limiting, restricting, denying, or impounding is necessary for the protection of the health, safety, or welfare of the public, the Department of Public Safety or the Department of Administration, as appropriate, shall give notice of the opportunity for an administrative hearing before a license, registration, title, permit, or privilege issued or allowed under this title or regulations adopted under this title is suspended, revoked, cancelled, limited, restricted, or denied or a vehicle is impounded by that department. If action is required under this section and prior opportunity for a hearing cannot be afforded, the appropriate department shall promptly give notice of the opportunity for a hearing as soon after the action as possible to the parties concerned.

(b) The notice under this section must state the reasons for the proposed action of the Department of Public Safety or of the Department of Administration, and must provide for a reasonable attendance date of not less than 10 days after service of the notice. If there is no request for a hearing by the attendance date specified in the notice, the hearing is considered to have been waived.

(a) Unless otherwise specifically provided, all hearings required under this title or regulations adopted under this title shall be conducted by the Department of Public Safety or the Department of Administration, as appropriate, under regulations adopted by the appropriate commissioner governing practice and procedure and consistent with due process of law. Hearings must be informal, and technical rules of evidence do not apply. A person who requests a hearing may retain an attorney. The hearing officer shall be appointed by the appropriate commissioner and may be appointed from the department conducting the hearing. A hearing officer need not be an attorney, but must be impartial and may not have participated in the decision that is under review. The hearing officer does not have to file a full opinion or make formal findings of fact or conclusions of law, but the hearing officer must state the reasons for the determination and indicate the evidence relied upon. The proceedings at the hearing shall be recorded.

(b) A hearing ordered under (a) of this section must be held by telephone unless the hearing officer finds that a telephonic hearing would substantially prejudice the rights of the person involved in the hearing or that an in-person hearing is necessary to decide the issues to be presented in the hearing.

The appropriate department shall grant a hearing delay if the person presents good cause for the delay. If a person fails to attend or appear for the hearing at the time and place stated by the appropriate department and if a hearing delay has not been granted, the person's failure to attend or appear is considered a waiver of the hearing and the appropriate department may take appropriate action with respect to the person.

(c) If at a hearing conducted by the Department of Administration under (a) of this section it appears that the record of the person sustains suspension, revocation, limitation, denial, or other remedial action, the hearing officer shall so order and the Department of Administration may suspend, revoke, limit, deny, or take other remedial action against that person's license, registration, or title and, if appropriate, the department shall adjust the person's point total accumulated under AS 28.15.231.

(d) A person aggrieved by the decision of the hearing officer may, within 30 days after a decision is mailed or delivered to the person, file an appeal in superior court for judicial review of the hearing officer's decision. The judicial review shall be on the record. The court may reverse the determination of the Department of Public Safety or of the Department of Administration if the court finds that the department making the determination misinterpreted the law, acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, or made a determination unsupported by the evidence in the record. The respective department's decision suspending, revoking, canceling, limiting, restricting, or denying a license, registration, title, permit, or privilege is stayed and does not take effect during the pendency of an appeal.

The surcharge required to be paid under this subsection shall be deposited into the general fund and accounted for under AS 37.05.142.

(d) The supreme court, in establishing scheduled amounts of bail under this section, and each municipality that establishes or has established a fine schedule under this section shall provide that the scheduled amount of bail or fine, as applicable, for a motor vehicle or traffic offense that is committed in a highway work zone or traffic safety corridor shall be double the amount of the bail or fine for the offense if it had not been committed in a highway work zone or traffic safety corridor.

(e) The supreme court, in establishing scheduled amounts of bail under this section, and each municipality that establishes or has established a fine schedule under this section may not allow for the disposition of an offense without court appearance for a person who is cited for violation of the traffic laws in connection with a motor vehicle accident if the accident resulted in the death of a person. In this subsection, "traffic laws" has the meaning given in AS 28.15.261.

###### Sec. 28.10.381.   Filing a lien or encumbrance.

(a) A lien or other encumbrance on a vehicle may be filed by delivering to the department

(1) a manufacturer's certificate of origin or an existing certificate of title;

(2) an application for a new certificate of title, signed by the registered owner and containing the name and address of any lienholder and the date of the lienholder's interest;

(3) applicable filing fees required by law; and

(4) other documents or information required by the department.

(b) Upon approval of the application, the department shall send to the person holding a lien or other encumbrance a new certificate of title which displays the name of the owner and indicates the existence of the lien or other encumbrance.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in AS 28.10.262, 28.10.263, and AS 34.85, after a certificate of title to a manufactured home has been issued and while the manufactured home is subject to a lien or encumbrance under (a) of this section,

###### Sec. 28.10.391.   Filing and date of notice.

However, a mortgage, conditional sale contract, or similar lien or encumbrance on the vehicle is subordinate to a lien under AS 28.10.502 and is subject to the procedure provided in that section. A lien or encumbrance on a vehicle for labor, material, transportation, storage, or similar activity, other than a lien under AS 28.10.502, whether or not dependent on possession for its validity, is subordinate only to a mortgage, conditional sale contract, or similar lien or encumbrance on the vehicle properly filed on or before the time that the vehicle is subject to, or comes into possession of, the lien or encumbrance claimant for the labor, material, transportation, storage, or similar activity.

(b) If the documents referred to in AS 28.10.371§28.10.401 are received and filed in the central office of the department within 10 days after the date that the documents were executed, the constructive notice dates from the time of the execution of the documents. Otherwise, constructive notice dates from the time of receipt and filing of the documents by the department as shown in its endorsement on the documents.

(c) Filing as provided in AS 28.10.371§28.10.401 is the exclusive method of giving constructive notice of a lien or encumbrance on a registered vehicle, except as to a lien dependent upon possession.

(d) A lien or encumbrance or a document creating and evidencing a lien or encumbrance is exempt from the other provisions of law that require or relate to the recording or filing of a document creating and evidencing a lien or encumbrance upon a vehicle of a type subject to registration under this chapter.

(e) Notwithstanding another provision of this section, the creation or termination of a lien or encumbrance with respect to a manufactured home that has been converted to real property under AS 34.85.010 is governed by the laws that apply to real property.

###### Sec. 28.10.400.   Transfer by dealer. [Repealed,§7 ch 178 SLA 1978.]

###### Sec. 28.10.401.   Assignment or release by lienholder.

(a) A person holding a lien or encumbrance upon a vehicle, other than a lien dependent solely upon possession, may assign that person's title to or interest in the vehicle to a person other than the owner without the consent of the owner and without affecting the interest of the owner or the registration of the vehicle.  The person assigning the interest shall give written notice of the assignment to the owner.  Upon receiving a certificate of title assigned by the holder of a lien or encumbrance shown on the certificate and the name and address of the assignee, accompanied by the title fee required under AS 28.10.441, the department shall issue a new certificate of title.

(b) A person holding a lien or encumbrance upon a vehicle, as shown on a certificate of title, may release the lien or encumbrance or assign that person's interest to the owner of the vehicle without affecting the registration of the vehicle. Upon receiving a certificate of title upon which a lienholder has released or assigned the lienholder's interest to the owner, or upon receipt of a certificate not endorsed but accompanied by a legal release from a lienholder of the lienholder's interest to a vehicle, and upon payment of the title fee required under AS 28.10.441, the department shall issue a new certificate of title.

###### Sec. 28.15.041.   Classification of drivers' licenses.

(a) The commissioner shall provide by regulation for the classification of drivers' licenses. The regulations must specify license classifications that are reasonably necessary for the safe operation of the various types, sizes, and combinations of motor vehicles. The regulations must also establish medical standards, standards of driving conduct and proficiency, and other standards governing the issuance, renewal, or denial of these licenses. The department may examine each applicant to determine the applicant's qualifications according to the class of license applied for, and upon issuing a driver's license the department shall indicate on the license the classification for which an applicant for a license has qualified by examination. The regulations and any subsequent modifications under this section become effective only if approved by a concurrent resolution adopted by a majority vote of each house of the legislature.

(b)  [Repealed,§5 ch 53 SLA 1990.]

(c)  [Repealed,§5 ch 53 SLA 1990.]

The state or a municipal government may not require a person to possess or use a driver's license that is federally compliant unless the person is a state or municipal employee and the duties of the person's job require the use of a driver's license that is federally compliant. The state or a municipal government shall otherwise treat a driver's license that is not federally compliant the same as a driver's license that is federally compliant. For a driver's license that is not federally compliant, the department

(1) shall retain an image of the face on the license for not more than 15 years after the date of application; if an applicant does not receive a driver's license, the department may not retain an image of the applicant's face;

(2) shall scan and retain only the minimum documents necessary for issuance of the driver's license; the department shall destroy any documents retained one year after the driver's license expires.

###### Sec. 28.15.050.   Applications. [Repealed,§19 ch 178 SLA 1978.]

###### Sec. 28.15.051.   Instruction permits, temporary drivers' licenses, and special drivers' permits and licenses.

(a) Except as provided in (b) of this section, a person who is at least 14 years of age may apply to the department for a noncommercial instruction permit. The department may, after the applicant has successfully passed all parts of the examination under  AS 28.15.081 other than the driving test, issue to the applicant an instruction permit. The permit allows a person, while having the permit in the person's immediate possession, to drive a specified noncommercial type or class of motor vehicle on a highway or vehicular way or area for a period not to exceed two years. The permittee shall be accompanied by a person at least 21 years of age who has been licensed at least one year to drive the type or class of vehicle being used, who is capable of exercising control over the vehicle and who occupies a seat beside the driver, or who accompanies and immediately supervises the driver when the permittee drives a motorcycle. An instruction permit may be renewed one time. Once a license is issued to drive a specified type or class of motor vehicle, a driver is not eligible to obtain an instructional permit for that specified type or class of motor vehicle unless five years have passed since the expiration of the license.

(b) The department, upon receiving proper application, may issue a restricted instruction permit effective for a school year or for a more restricted period to an applicant who is at least 14 years of age and who is enrolled in a driver education program that includes practice driving and is approved by the department.  The restricted instruction permit allows the permittee, when the permittee has the permit in the permittee's immediate possession, to drive a specified type or class of motor vehicle; however, an approved instructor must occupy a seat beside the permittee or, if the permittee is driving a motorcycle, the permittee must be accompanied by and under the immediate supervision of an approved instructor.

(c) The department may issue a temporary driver's license to an applicant for a driver's license permitting the applicant to drive a specified type or class of motor vehicle while the department is completing its investigation and determination of all facts relative to the applicant's eligibility to receive a driver's license. The temporary license must be in the applicant's immediate possession while the applicant is driving a motor vehicle. A temporary driver's license is invalid when the applicant's license has been issued or has been refused for good cause.

(d) The department may issue a special driver's permit to a person who is at least 14 years of age with the consent of the person's parents, guardians, or spouse who is 18 years of age or older, for the purpose of driving a motor-driven cycle. This permit may be issued upon application and successful completion of all prescribed tests and fees, and is valid for the same period of time as a driver's license.  The permit is not valid in a municipality that by ordinance prohibits the driving of a motor-driven cycle by a person under the age of 16 years; a borough may adopt the ordinance on a nonareawide basis only, unless the power to adopt it on an areawide basis is acquired under  AS 29.35.300 § 29.35.330 or former AS 29.33.250§29.33.290.

(e) Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, the department may issue a special driver's license to a person who is under the age of 16 years because of the circumstances of hardship.  Special licenses to be issued because of hardship shall be determined on an individual basis by the commissioner.

(f) A person who is at least 18 years of age may apply to the department for a commercial instruction permit. The department may, after the applicant has successfully passed all parts of the examination under  AS 28.15.081 other than the driving test, issue to the applicant a commercial instruction permit. The permit allows a person, while having the permit in the person's immediate possession, to drive a specified commercial type or class of motor vehicle on a highway or vehicular way or area for a period not to exceed 180 days. The permittee shall be accompanied by a person at least 21 years of age who has been licensed at least one year to drive the type or class of vehicle being used, who is capable of exercising control over the wheel, and who occupies a seat beside the driver. A commercial instruction permit may be renewed one time for a period of 180 days. Once a license is issued to drive a specified type or class of motor vehicle, a driver is not eligible to obtain a commercial instructional permit for that specified type or class of motor vehicle unless

(1) five years have passed since the expiration of the previous license; or

(2) the commercial instruction permit is obtained for the purpose of adding an endorsement to a current class of commercial license.

###### Sec. 28.15.055.   Provisional driver's license.

Upon application, the department may issue a provisional driver's license to a person who is at least 16 years of age but not yet 18 years of age if the

(2) held a valid provisional driver's license issued under AS 28.15.055 for at least six months; and

(3) not been convicted of violating a traffic law during the six months before applying for a driver's license; in this paragraph, "traffic law" has the meaning given to "traffic laws" in AS 28.15.261.

(b) A person authorized to drive a motor vehicle under a provisional driver's license issued under AS 28.15.055 may not

(1) operate a motor vehicle that is carrying any passengers

(A) except a passenger who is a parent, legal guardian, sibling, or a person at least 21 years of age; or

Upon receipt of that record by the department, it becomes a part of the driver's record in this state with the same effect as if the record originated in this state.

(d) An employee of the department who processes a driver's license application, other than an application received by mail, shall ask the applicant orally whether the applicant wishes to execute an anatomical gift. The department shall make known to all applicants the procedure for executing an anatomical gift under AS 13.52 (Health Care Decisions Act) by displaying posters in the offices in which applications are taken, by providing a brochure or other written information to each person who applies in person or by mail, and, if requested, by providing oral advice. The department shall inform each applicant in writing that, if the applicant executes a gift under AS 13.52 and if the gift is made with the driver's license application, the department will transmit the information on the license to a donor registry created under AS 13.50.110.

(2) the person has the right to administrative review of the action taken against the person's license or determination not to issue an original license;

(3) if the person has a driver's license or a nonresident privilege to drive, the notice itself is a temporary driver's license that expires seven days after it is delivered to the person, except that if the person was operating a commercial motor vehicle the person will be ordered out of service for 24 hours under AS 28.33.130;

(B) grounds for the officer's belief that the person operated a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle that was involved in an accident causing death or serious physical injury to another person.

(d) The period of revocation of a driver's license, privilege to drive, privilege to obtain a license, refusal to issue an original license, or disqualification shall be for the appropriate minimum period for court revocations under AS 28.15.181(c) or court disqualifications under AS 28.33.140. A department hearing officer may grant limited license privileges in accordance with the standards set out in AS 28.15.201 to a person whose driver's license or nonresident privilege to drive was revoked under this section. The department may terminate a revocation imposed under this section and issue a driver's license to the person, if the license, privilege to drive, or privilege to obtain a license was revoked for an offense described in AS 28.15.181(a)(5) or (8) and the person meets the conditions set out for termination of a revocation by the court under AS 28.15.181(f).

(e) A person whose driver's license, privilege to drive, or privilege to obtain a license has been revoked under this section as a result of a refusal to submit to a chemical test authorized under AS 28.35.031(a) or (g) or a similar municipal ordinance or a chemical test administered under AS 28.35.031(a) or (g) or a similar municipal ordinance in which the test produced a result described in AS 28.35.030(a)(2) may request that the department rescind the revocation. The department shall rescind a revocation under this subsection if the department finds that the person has supplied proof in a form satisfactory to the department that

(1) the person has been acquitted of driving while under the influence under AS 28.35.030, refusal to submit to a chemical test under AS 28.35.032, or a similar municipal ordinance for the incident on which the revocation was based; or

(2) all criminal charges against the person for driving while under the influence under AS 28.35.030 or a similar municipal ordinance and refusing to submit to a chemical test under AS 28.35.032 or a similar municipal ordinance in relation to the incident on which the revocation is based have been dismissed.

###### Sec. 28.15.166.   Administrative review of revocation.

(a) A person who has received a notice under  AS 28.15.165(a) may make a written request for administrative review of the department's action under  AS 28.15.165(c) or for limited license privileges under  AS 28.15.165(d). If the person's driver's license has not been previously surrendered to the department, it shall be surrendered to the department at the time the request for review is made.

(b) A request for review of the department's action under  AS 28.15.165 shall be made within seven days after receipt of the notice under  AS 28.15.165 or the right to review is waived and the action of the department under  AS 28.15.165(c) is final. If a written request for a review is made after expiration of the seven-day period, and if it is accompanied by the applicant's verified statement explaining the failure to make a timely request for a review, the department shall receive and consider the request. If the department finds that the person was unable to make a timely request because of lack of actual notice of the department's action or because of factors of physical incapacity such as hospitalization or incarceration, the department shall waive the period of limitation, reopen the matter, and grant the review request. An initial request for limited license privileges may be made at any time. Subsequent requests for limited license privileges may not be made unless the applicant demonstrates a significant change in circumstances.

(c) Upon receipt of a request for review, if it appears that the person holds a valid driver's license and that the driver's license has been surrendered, the department shall issue a temporary driver's permit that is valid until the scheduled date for the review. A person who has requested a review under this section may request, and the department may grant for good cause, a delay in the date of the hearing.  If necessary, the department may issue additional temporary permits to stay the effective date of its action under  AS 28.15.165(c) until the final order after the review is issued.

(d) A person who has requested a hearing under this section and who fails to attend or appear at the hearing, for reasons other than lack of actual notice of the hearing or physical incapacity such as hospitalization or incarceration, waives the right to a hearing. The determination of the department that is based upon the enforcement officer's report becomes final.

(e) The hearing under this section must be held by telephone unless the hearing officer finds that a telephonic hearing would substantially prejudice the rights of the person involved in the hearing or that an in-person hearing is necessary to decide the issues to be presented in the hearing. An in-person hearing must be held at the office of the department nearest to the residence of the person involved in the hearing unless the department and the person agree that the hearing is to be held elsewhere.

(f) A review under this section shall be held before a hearing officer designated by the commissioner. The hearing officer has authority to

(1) administer oaths and affirmations;

(2) examine witnesses and take testimony;

(3) receive relevant evidence;

(4) issue subpoenas, take depositions, or cause depositions or interrogatories to be taken;

(5) regulate the course and conduct of the hearing;

(6) make a final ruling on the issue.

(g) The hearing for review of action by the department under  AS 28.15.165 shall be limited to the issues of whether the law enforcement officer had probable cause to believe that the person was operating a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle that was involved in an accident causing death or serious physical injury to another, or that the person was operating a motor vehicle, commercial motor vehicle, or aircraft while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, inhalant, or controlled substance in violation of  AS 28.33.030 or  AS 28.35.030 and whether

(1) the person refused to submit to a chemical test authorized under  AS 28.33.031(a) or  AS 28.35.031(a) or (g) after being advised that refusal would result in disqualification or the suspension, revocation, or denial of the person's license, privilege to drive, or privilege to obtain a license, and that the refusal is a misdemeanor;

(2) the chemical test administered under  AS 28.33.031(a) or  AS 28.35.031(a) or (g) produced a result described in  AS 28.35.030(a)(2); or

(3) the chemical test administered under  AS 28.33.031(a) produced a result described in  AS 28.33.030(a)(2).

(h) The determination of the hearing officer may be based upon the sworn report of a law enforcement officer.  The law enforcement officer need not be present at the hearing unless either the person requesting the hearing or the hearing officer requests in writing before the hearing that the officer be present.  If in the course of the hearing it becomes apparent that the testimony of the law enforcement officer is necessary to enable the hearing officer to resolve disputed issues of fact, the hearing may be continued to allow the attendance of the law enforcement officer.

(i) Testimony given by the person at the hearing is not admissible against the person in a criminal trial unless the person's testimony at the trial is inconsistent with that given at the hearing.

(j) If the issues set out in (g) of this section are determined in the affirmative by a preponderance of the evidence, the hearing officer shall sustain the action of the department. If one or more of the issues is determined in the negative, the department's action shall be rescinded.

(k) If the action of the department in revoking a nonresident's privilege to drive a motor vehicle is not administratively contested by the nonresident driver or if the departmental action is sustained by the hearing officer, the department shall give written notice of action taken to the motor vehicle administrator of the state of the person's residence and to any state in which that person has a driver's license.

(l)    [Repealed,§34 ch 119 SLA 1990.]

(m) Within 30 days of the issuance of the final determination of the department, a person aggrieved by the determination may file an appeal in superior court for judicial review of the hearing officer's determination. The judicial review shall be on the record, without taking additional testimony. The court may reverse the department's determination if the court finds that the department misinterpreted the law, acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, or made a determination unsupported by the evidence in the record.

(n) The filing of an appeal under (m) of this section or a petition for review does not automatically stay the department's order or revocation. The court may grant a stay of the order or revocation only upon a motion and hearing, and upon a finding that there is a reasonable probability that the petitioner will prevail on the merits, that the petitioner will suffer irreparable harm if the order is not stayed, and in a case where the petitioner operates a commercial motor vehicle that the public can be adequately protected by conditions imposed by the court.

(c) If a person licensed to operate a commercial motor vehicle in another jurisdiction is convicted in this state of a traffic offense, whether or not involving a commercial motor vehicle, or if the person is disqualified by this state for a period of 60 days or more, the department shall, within 10 days after notification of the conviction or the disqualification, notify appropriate authorities in the state that issued the license.

If a written request for a review is made after expiration of the 10-day period, and if it is accompanied by the applicant's verified statement explaining the failure to make a timely request for a review, the department shall receive and consider the request. If the department finds that the person was unable to make a timely request because of lack of actual notice of the revocation or because of factors of physical incapacity such as hospitalization or incarceration, the department shall waive the period of limitation, reopen the matter, and grant the review request.

(c) Upon receipt of a request for review, if it appears that the person holds a valid driver's license or permit and that the driver's license or permit has been surrendered, the department shall issue a temporary driver's permit that is valid until the scheduled date for the review. A person who has requested a review under this section may request, and the department may grant for good cause, a delay in the date of the hearing. If necessary, the department may issue additional temporary permits to stay the effective date of its action under AS 28.15.183(c) until the final order after the review is issued.

(d) A person who has requested a hearing under this section and who fails to appear at the hearing, for reasons other than lack of actual notice of the hearing or physical incapacity such as hospitalization or incarceration, waives the right to a hearing.

(h) The determination of the hearing officer may be based upon the sworn report of a peace officer, if the sworn report is supported by probable cause based on personal observations as required under AS 28.15.183(a). The peace officer need not be present at the hearing unless either the person requesting the hearing or the hearing officer requests in writing before the hearing that the officer be present.

(l) Within 30 days of the issuance of the final determination of the department, a person aggrieved by the determination may file an appeal in superior court for judicial review of the hearing officer's determination. The judicial review shall be on the record without taking additional testimony. The court may reverse the department's determination if the court finds that the department misinterpreted the law, acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, or made a determination unsupported by the evidence in the record.

(m) The filing of an appeal under (l) of this section or a petition for review does not automatically stay the department's order or revocation. The court may grant a stay of the order or revocation under the applicable rules of court, after a motion and hearing, and upon a finding that there is a reasonable probability that the petitioner will prevail on the merits and that the petitioner will suffer irreparable harm if the order is not stayed.

(b) The regulations adopted under (a) of this section shall include a designated level of point accumulation which identifies drivers who are habitually reckless or negligent or who are habitual or frequent violators of traffic laws, so as to show a disrespect for traffic laws and a disregard for the safety of other persons. In formulating the point system authorized by this section, the commissioner shall, in the interest of interstate uniformity, provide for suspension, revocation or denial of a driver's license, privilege to drive, or privilege to obtain a license for an accumulation of 12 or more points as a result of offenses committed during any consecutive 12-month period or 18 or more points as a result of offenses committed during any 24-month period.

The department may require a problem driver to appear for a driver improvement interview.  The purpose of that interview is to assist the person who is identified as a problem driver in overcoming substandard driving habits.  An interview under this subsection is to be conducted in an informal manner.

(1) not more than one driver improvement or one alcohol information course may be used to obtain a reduction in points in any 12-month period; and

(e) Except for immediate action under AS 28.15.181, when the department proposes to take action against a driver's license under (b) of this section, it shall notify the licensee that the proposed action shall become effective 30 days from the date of the notice, except that the licensee shall have the right, within the 30-day period, to make an oral or written answer or statement in which the licensee may controvert any point or issue and the licensee may present evidence and arguments for the consideration of the department pertinent to the action to be taken or the grounds for the action.

A person is relieved from the requirement for deposit of security for a claim for injury or damage arising out of the accident if the person is finally adjudicated not to be liable for the claim.

###### Sec. 28.20.120.   Agreements for payment of damages.

(a) Two or more persons involved in or affected by an accident as described in AS 28.20.050 may at any time enter into a written agreement for the payment of an agreed amount with respect to their claims because of bodily injury, death, or property damage arising from the accident.

###### Sec. 28.20.170.   Authority of department to decrease amount of security.

###### Sec. 28.20.310.   Exception when consent granted by judgment creditor.

If the judgment creditor consents in writing in a form prescribed by the department to the issuance of a license or nonresident's operating privilege to the judgment debtor, the department may allow it for six months from the date of such consent and thereafter until the consent is revoked in writing, if the judgment debtor furnishes proof of financial responsibility notwithstanding default in the payment of judgment, or of an installment of the judgment prescribed in AS 28.20.270.

###### Sec. 28.20.320.   Exceptions when insurer liable.

A license or nonresident's operating privilege may not be suspended under this chapter if the department finds that an insurer is obligated to pay the judgment upon which suspension is based at least to the extent and for the amounts required in this chapter, but has not paid the judgment for any reason.  A finding by the department that an insurer is obligated to pay a judgment is not binding upon the insurer and has no legal effect except for the purpose of administering this section.  If in a judicial proceeding it is determined by a final judgment, decree, or order that an insurer is not obligated to pay a judgment, the department, notwithstanding any contrary finding made by it, shall immediately suspend the license or nonresident's operating privilege of a person against whom the judgment is given, as provided in AS 28.20.270.

(3) $25,000 is credited upon a judgment given in excess of that amount because of injury to or destruction of property of others as a result of any one accident.

(b) However, payments made in settlement of a claim because of bodily injury, death, or property damage arising from the accident shall be credited in reduction of the amounts provided for in this section.

###### Sec. 28.20.370.   Installment payment of judgments; default.

(a) A judgment debtor upon due notice to the judgment creditor may apply to the court in which such judgment was rendered for the privilege of paying the judgment in installments and the court, without prejudice at any other legal remedy, may order and fix the amount and time of payment of the installments.

(b) The department may not suspend a license or nonresident's operating privilege, and shall restore a license or nonresident's operating privilege suspended following nonpayment of a judgment, when the judgment debtor gives proof of financial responsibility and obtains an order permitting the payment of the judgment in installments.

(c) If the judgment debtor fails to pay an installment specified by the court order, upon notice of default, the department shall immediately suspend the license or nonresident's operating privilege of the judgment debtor until the judgment is satisfied as provided in this chapter.

###### Sec. 28.20.380.   Registration and operator's rights limited by extent of proof.

(a) When a certificate is filed showing that a policy is issued covering a motor vehicle owned by the insured, but not insuring the person when operating a motor vehicle not owned by the person, the restriction may be removed upon the filing of a certificate showing an operator's policy issued to the person.

(b) If the department receives evidence of the violation of the restriction on the license, it may suspend the license until a certificate is filed showing an operator's policy issued to the holder of the license.

###### Sec. 28.20.390.   Proof by persons who do not own a vehicle.

(1) a certificate of insurance as provided in AS 28.20.410 or 28.20.420;

(2) a bond as provided in AS 28.20.470; or

(3) a certificate of self-insurance as provided in AS 28.20.400, supplemented by an agreement by the self-insurer that, for accidents occurring while the certificate is in force, the self-insurer will pay the same amount that an insurer would be obligated to pay under an owner's motor vehicle liability policy if it had issued a policy to the self-insurer.

###### Sec. 28.20.400.   Self-insurers.

(a) A person in whose name more than 25 vehicles are registered in this state may qualify as a self-insurer by obtaining a certificate of self-insurance issued by the department as provided in (b) of this section. A person in whose name 25 or fewer vehicles are registered qualifies as a self-insurer and shall be issued a certificate of self-insurance if the person provides proof satisfactory to the department that the person has and will continue to have the ability to pay a judgment for property damage, bodily injury, or both, in the amount of at least $125,000.

(b) The department may issue a certificate of self-insurance when it is satisfied that the person has and will continue to have ability to pay judgments obtained against the person.  The certificate may be issued authorizing a person to act as a self-insurer for either property damage or bodily injury, or both, or within the limits the department prescribes.

(c) Upon not less than 10 days' notice and a hearing pursuant to the notice, the department may upon reasonable grounds cancel a certificate of self-insurance.  Failure to pay a judgment within 30 days after judgment becomes final is a reasonable ground for the cancellation of a certificate of self-insurance.

###### Sec. 28.20.410.   Certificate of insurance as proof.

Proof of financial responsibility for the future may be furnished by filing with the department the written certificate of an insurance carrier authorized to do business in this state certifying that there is in effect a motor vehicle liability policy for the benefit of the person required to furnish proof of financial responsibility.  The certificate must give the effective date of the motor vehicle liability policy, which must be the same as the effective date of the certificate, and must designate by description or appropriate reference all vehicles covered by it, unless the policy is issued to a person who is not the owner of a motor vehicle.

###### Sec. 28.20.420.   Certificate furnished by nonresident as proof.

(a) A nonresident may give proof of financial responsibility by filing with the department a written certificate of an insurance carrier authorized to transact business in the state in which the vehicle described in the certificate is registered, or if the nonresident does not own a vehicle, then in the state in which the nonresident resides, if the certificate otherwise conforms with this chapter; the department shall accept it upon condition that the insurance carrier complies with (b) and (c) of this section.

(b) The insurance carrier shall execute a power of attorney authorizing the department to accept service on its behalf of notice or process in an action arising out of a motor vehicle accident in this state.

(c) The insurance carrier shall agree in writing that the policy shall conform with the laws of this state relating to the terms of motor vehicle liability policies issued in this state.

###### Sec. 28.20.430.   Default by nonresident insurer.

If an insurance carrier not authorized to transact business in this state, but qualified to furnish proof of financial responsibility in this state, defaults in an undertaking or agreement, the department may not accept as proof a certificate of the carrier whether previously filed or thereafter tendered as proof, so long as the default continues.

###### Sec. 28.20.440.   Motor vehicle liability policy defined; required provisions.

(a) In this chapter, "motor vehicle liability policy" means an "owner policy" or an "operator's policy" containing an agreement or endorsement as provided in this section, or certified as provided in AS 28.20.410 or 28.20.420 as proof of financial responsibility for the future, and issued, except as otherwise provided in AS 28.20.420, by an insurance carrier authorized to transact business in this state, to or for the benefit of the person named as insured.

(b) The owner's policy of liability insurance must

(1) designate by description or appropriate reference all vehicles that it covers;

(2) insure the person named and every other person using the vehicle with the express or implied permission of the named insured, against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the vehicle within the United States or Canada, subject to limits exclusive of interest and costs, with respect to each vehicle, as follows: $50,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident, and, subject to the same limit for one person, $100,000 because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, and $25,000 because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident;

(3) contain coverage in not less than the amounts set out in (2) of this subsection for the protection of the persons insured under the policy who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured or underinsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury or death, or damage to or destruction of property arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle; this coverage must comply with the provisions of AS 28.20.445.

(c) The operator's policy of liability insurance must insure the person named as insured against loss from the liability imposed upon the person by law for damages arising out of the use by the person of any motor vehicle not owned by the person, within the same territorial limits and subject to the same limits of liability as are required for an owner's policy of liability insurance.

(d) The motor vehicle liability policy must state the name and address of the named insured, the coverage, the premium charges, the policy period, and the limits of liability, and must contain an agreement or an endorsement that insurance is provided in accordance with the coverage defined in this chapter for bodily injury and death or property damage, or both, and is subject to all the provisions of AS 28.20.010 § 28.20.640.

(e) The motor vehicle liability policy need not insure liability under a workers' compensation law nor liability for damage to property owned by, rented to, in charge of or transported by the insured.

(f) Every motor vehicle liability policy is subject to the following provisions but these provisions need not be contained in the policy.

(1) The liability of the insurance carrier becomes absolute whenever injury or damage covered by the policy occurs; the policy may not be cancelled or annulled as to this liability after the occurrence of the injury or damage; no statement made by the insured or on behalf of the insured and no violation of the policy defeats or voids the policy.

(2) The satisfaction by the insured of a judgment for injury or damages is not a condition precedent to the right or duty of the insurance carrier to make payment on account of injury or damage.

(3) The insurance carrier may settle a claim covered by the policy, and if settlement is made in good faith, the amount of settlement is deductible from the limits of liability specified in (b) of this section.

(4) The policy, the written application for the policy, if any, and every rider or endorsement that does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter constitute the entire contract between the parties.

(g) A policy that grants the coverage required for a motor vehicle liability policy may also grant lawful coverage in excess of or in addition to the coverage specified for a policy and the excess or additional coverage is not subject to the provisions of this chapter. With respect to a policy that grants excess or additional coverage the term "motor vehicle liability policy" applies only to that part of the coverage that is required by this section.

(h) A motor vehicle liability policy may provide that the insured shall reimburse the insurance carrier for any payment the insurance carrier would not have been obligated to make under the terms of the policy except for the provisions of this chapter.

(i) A motor vehicle liability policy may provide for proration of the insurance with other valid and collectible insurance.

(j) The requirements for a motor vehicle liability policy may be fulfilled by the policies of one or more insurance carriers that together meet the requirements.

(k) A binder issued pending the issuance of a motor vehicle liability policy fulfills the requirements for a policy.

(l) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, a person who resides in the same household as the person named as insured or a person who is a relative of the person named as insured shall be excluded from coverage under a motor vehicle liability policy if the person named as insured requests that that person be excluded from coverage.

###### Sec. 28.20.445.   Uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.

(a) The maximum liability of the insurance carrier under the uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage required to be offered under AS 28.20.440 shall be the lesser of

(1) the difference between the amount of the covered person's damages for bodily injury and property damage and the amount paid to the covered person by or for a person who is or may be held legally liable for the damages; and

(2) the applicable limit of liability of the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.

(b) An amount payable under the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall be excess to an amount payable under automobile bodily injury, death, or medical payments coverage, or as workers' compensation benefits and may not duplicate amounts paid or payable under valid and collectible automobile bodily injury, death, or medical payments coverage, or as workers' compensation benefits.

(c) If a person is entitled to uninsured or underinsured motorists coverage under more than one coverage when two or more vehicles are insured under one policy, the maximum amount payable may not exceed the highest limit of any one coverage under the policy. If a person is entitled to uninsured or underinsured motorists coverage under more than one motor vehicle policy issued by the same insurer in the same household, the maximum amount payable may be limited to the highest limit of any one coverage under the policies. If a person is entitled to uninsured or underinsured motorists coverage under more than one policy providing motor vehicle liability coverage, payments will be made in the following order of priority, subject to the limit of liability of each applicable policy or coverage:

(1) a policy or coverage covering a motor vehicle occupied by the injured person or a policy or coverage covering a pedestrian as a named insured;

(2) a policy or coverage covering a motor vehicle occupied by the injured person as an insured other than as a named insured;

(3) a policy or coverage not covering a motor vehicle occupied by the injured person but covering the injured person as a named insured;

(2) if there was 0.04 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, or 40 milligrams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the person's blood, or 0.04 grams or more of alcohol per 210 liters of the person's breath, it is presumed that the person was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage.

The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person does not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer; the fact that the person under arrest sought to obtain an additional test, and failed or was unable to do so, is likewise admissible in evidence.

(e) Upon the request of the person who submits to a chemical test at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test, including the results of it, shall be made available to the person or person's attorney.

###### Sec. 28.35.026.   [Renumbered as AS 28.35.320.]

###### Sec. 28.35.028.   Court-ordered treatment.

(a) Notwithstanding another provision of law, with the consent of the state and the defendant, the court may elect to proceed in a criminal case under AS 04.16.200(b) or (e), AS 28.35.030, or 28.35.032, including the case of a defendant charged with violating the terms of probation, under the procedure provided in this section and order the defendant to complete a court-ordered treatment program. The state may not consent to a referral under this subsection unless the state has consulted with the victim and explained the process and consequences of the referral to the victim. A court may not elect to proceed under this section if the defendant has previously participated in a court-ordered treatment program under this section two or more times.

(b) Once the court elects to proceed under this section, the defendant shall enter a no contest or guilty plea to the offense or shall admit to a probation violation, as appropriate. The state and the defendant may enter into a plea agreement to determine the offense or offenses to which the defendant is required to plead. If the court accepts the agreement, the court shall enforce the terms of the agreement. The court shall enter a judgment of conviction for the offense or offenses for which the defendant has pleaded or an order finding that the defendant has violated probation, as appropriate. A judgment of conviction or an order finding a probation violation must set a schedule for payment of restitution owed by the defendant. In a judgment of conviction and on probation conditions that the court considers appropriate, the court may withhold pronouncement of a period of imprisonment or a fine to provide an incentive for the defendant to complete recommended treatment successfully.

However, notwithstanding Rule 35, Alaska Rules of Criminal Procedure, and any other provision of law, the court, at any time after the period when a reduction of sentence is normally available, may consider and reduce the defendant's sentence, including imprisonment, fine, or license revocation, based on the defendant's compliance with the treatment plan; when reducing a sentence, the court (1) may not reduce the sentence below the mandatory minimum sentence for the offense unless the court finds that the defendant has successfully complied with and completed the treatment plan and that the treatment plan approximated the severity of the minimum period of imprisonment, and (2) may consider the defendant's compliance with the treatment plan as a mitigating factor allowing a reduction of a sentence under AS 12.55.155(a). A court entering an order finding the defendant has violated probation may withhold pronouncement of disposition to provide an incentive for the defendant to complete the recommended treatment successfully.

(c) If the defendant does not successfully complete the treatment plan imposed by the court under this section, the defendant's no contest or guilty plea or admission to a probation violation to the court shall stand, and the sentence previously imposed shall be executed or, if sentence has not yet been imposed, sentence shall be imposed by the court.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the judge, the state, the defendant, and the agencies involved in the defendant's treatment plan are entitled to information and reports bearing on the defendant's assessment, treatment, and progress. The victim is entitled to periodic reports on the defendant's progress and participation.

(e) In addition to other conditions authorized under AS 12.30 or AS 12.55, a court may impose the following conditions of bail or probation:

(1) require the defendant to submit to electronic monitoring;

(2) require the defendant to submit to house arrest.

(f) A court shall refer a defendant who is ordered to participate in a treatment program under this section to an alcohol safety action program developed and implemented or designated under AS 47.37.040(21) for screening, referral, and monitoring.

(H) requires adherence to conditions of probation;

###### Sec. 28.35.033.   Presumptions and chemical analysis of breath or blood.

(a) Upon the trial of a civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by a person while operating or driving a motor vehicle or operating an aircraft or a watercraft while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, inhalant, or controlled substance, the amount of alcohol in the person's blood or breath at the time alleged shall give rise to the following presumptions:

(1) If there was 0.04 percent or less by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, or 40 milligrams or less of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the person's blood, or 0.04 grams or less of alcohol per 210 liters of the person's breath, it shall be presumed that the person was not under the influence of an alcoholic beverage.

(2) If there was in excess of 0.04 percent but less than 0.08 percent by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, or in excess of 40 but less than 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the person's blood, or in excess of 0.04 grams but less than 0.08 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of the person's breath, that fact does not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, but that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage.

(3) If there was 0.08 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, or 80 milligrams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the person's blood, or 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 210 liters of the person's breath, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage.

(b) For purposes of this chapter, percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood.

(c) Except as provided in AS 28.35.030(s), the provisions of (a) of this section may not be construed to limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether the person was or was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

(d) To be considered valid under the provisions of this section the chemical analysis of the person's breath or blood shall have been performed according to methods approved by the Department of Public Safety.  The Department of Public Safety is authorized to approve satisfactory techniques, methods, and standards of training necessary to ascertain the qualifications of individuals to conduct the analysis.  If it is established at trial that a chemical analysis of breath or blood was performed according to approved methods by a person trained according to techniques, methods, and standards of training approved by the Department of Public Safety, there is a presumption that the test results are valid and further foundation for introduction of the evidence is unnecessary.

(e) The person tested may have a physician, or a qualified technician, chemist, registered or advanced practice registered nurse, or other qualified person of the person's own choosing administer a chemical test in addition to the test administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer.

(1) deterrence of the convicted person from the commission of future offenses under AS 28.15.291(b), AS 28.35.030, or 28.35.032;

(2) protection of the safety and welfare of the public;

(2) the time and place of the forfeiture hearing;

(3) the legal authority under which the motor vehicle, aircraft, or watercraft, may be forfeited;

(4) notice of the right to intervene to protect the interest in the motor vehicle, aircraft, or watercraft.

(b) At the hearing, a person who claims an ownership or security interest in the motor vehicle, aircraft, or watercraft, must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that

(2) a person other than the petitioner was convicted of the offense that resulted in the forfeiture; and

(3) before parting with the motor vehicle, aircraft, or watercraft, the petitioner did not know or have reasonable cause to believe that it would be used in the commission of an offense.
