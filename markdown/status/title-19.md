###### Sec. 19.30.410.   Vacation of rights-of-way.

Notwithstanding another provision of law, the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, or another agency of the state may not vacate a right-of-way acquired by the state under former 43 U.S.C. 932 unless

(1) a reasonably comparable, established alternate right-of-way or means of access exists that is sufficient to satisfy all present and reasonably foreseeable uses;

(2) the right-of-way is within a municipality, the municipal assembly or council has requested the vacation, a reasonable alternative means of access is available, and the vacation is in the best interests of the state; or

(3) the vacation is approved by the legislature.

###### Sec. 19.30.420.   Immunity from liability for damages; risk of use of right-of-way acquired under former 43 U.S.C. 932.

(a) Notwithstanding AS 09.50.250 and AS 09.65.070, the state and its political subdivisions are not liable for damages, injury, or death arising from AS 19.30.400§19.30.420 and the recording of any rights-of-way identified in AS 19.30.400 or acquired under former 43 U.S.C. 932.

(b) A right-of-way identified under AS 19.30.400 or acquired under former 43 U.S.C. 932 that is not designated as part of the state highway system under AS 19.10.020 is traveled and used at the risk of the user. As to those rights-of-way and notwithstanding AS 09.50.250 and AS 09.65.070, the state and a political subdivision of the state are not liable for damages, injury, or death

(1) arising from the use of the right-of-way;

(2) arising from the failure to inspect, mark, or maintain the right-of-way;

## Chapter 35. Relocation Assistance.

[Repealed,§2 ch 41 SLA 1971.]

## Chapter 40. James Dalton Highway.

###### Sec. 19.40.010.   Declaration of policy.

(a) The legislature finds and declares that there is an immediate need for a public highway from the Yukon River to the Arctic Ocean and that this public highway should be constructed by the State of Alaska at this time because

(1) it will assist in the fulfillment of art. VIII, Sec. 1, Constitution of the State of Alaska, in which it is provided that it is the policy of the state to encourage the settlement of its land and the development of its resources by making them available for maximum use consistent with the public interest;

(2) it will provide the first year-round, overland route from north of the Yukon River to the Arctic Ocean, and will consequently result in the completion of a highway from the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean;

(3) it is in conformity with the policy of 23 U.S.C. 101(b) (Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956), in which it is declared to be in the national interest to accelerate the construction of certain highways which are of primary importance to the national defense;

(4) it will benefit local and interstate commerce because the area north of the Yukon River is rich in natural resources but is inaccessible at the present time because of the lack of roads and this inaccessibility prohibits the successful use of the natural resources of this area;

(5) it is consonant with art. VIII, Sec. 2, Constitution of the State of Alaska, in which it is provided that the legislature shall provide for the utilization, development, and conservation of all natural resources belonging to the state, including land and water, for the maximum benefit of its people, because the highway will benefit not only local and interstate commerce but will also augment the revenue of the state and result in conservation of natural resources, for example, by facilitating a system of wildland fire suppression.

(b) It is the sense of the legislature that the construction of the highway will not impair the natural wilderness adjacent to the highway and will not unreasonably interfere with subsistence hunting, fishing, trapping, and gathering.

(c) It is the intent of the legislature that the state shall be reimbursed for the cost plus interest of constructing the public highway from the Yukon River to the Arctic Ocean.

(d) It is the intent of the legislature that employment of Alaska residents be encouraged and that the provisions of AS 36.10 be complied with.

###### Sec. 19.40.015.   Highway named.

The highway is named the James Dalton Highway.

###### Sec. 19.40.020.   Contractual authority.

(a) Subject to (b) of this section, the department may contract in accordance with AS 36.30 for the construction of a secondary highway from the Yukon River to the Arctic Ocean.  The provisions of AS 36.10 govern in employment practices on all work authorized by this chapter.

(b) The authority granted under (a) of this section may not be exercised until the state enters into a contract with the participants in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System or other organization formed for the purpose of transporting oil by pipeline from the North Slope (that area of Alaska lying north of 68 degrees latitude).  The contract shall provide for reimbursement to the state by the participants, jointly and severally, in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System or other organization formed for the purpose of transporting oil by pipeline, of the full amount of the highway's cost of construction plus interest on the state's expenditures at the rate of seven and one-half percent per year. Complete reimbursement together with interest shall be made within five years from the date of the contract.  The state may, with the agreement of the participants, elect to construct an oil pipeline from the North Slope.  In that event, the provisions of this subsection requiring reimbursement do not apply.

(c) The contract with the participants must include additional terms and conditions that are in the best interests of the state.  Any advance payments made under the contract shall be deposited in a special account which will be used for disbursements to the contractor charged with construction of the highway.  Disbursements to the contractor shall be made on order of the commissioner of transportation and public facilities on presentation of a proper voucher or the presentation of a voucher by an employee of the department authorized in writing to certify as to such payment.

###### Sec. 19.40.030.   Undertakings of contractors.

The department, in place of the bonds or individual sureties required by AS 36.25.010, may accept corporate undertakings that include the same essential provisions of the bonds or individual sureties required by AS 36.25.010 and that are satisfactory to the department.

###### Sec. 19.40.040.   Exemption.

The Alaska Net Income Tax Act and the Alaska Business License Act do not apply to any money received by the general contractor from the state under a highway construction contract authorized under this chapter if the money is to be paid to a subcontractor for work performed under the construction contract.  The money received by the subcontractors is subject to the Alaska Net Income Tax Act, the Alaska Business License Act, and any other applicable state taxes.

###### Sec. 19.40.050.   Highway width.

In accordance with AS 19.10.015, the width of this highway is designated as 200 feet.

(2) certification by the commissioner of transportation and public facilities that the road design and construction methods will cause minimal landscape defacement or environmental degradation by erosion or waste disposal;

(3) certification by the commissioner of health that adequate and reasonable precautions have been taken for the prevention of pollution during construction and subsequent public use;

(4) all certifications, as well as the regulations, contract provisions, specifications, inspection procedures, and programs necessary to implement and accomplish AS 19.40.020§19.40.050 shall be filed with the governor's office and published;

(5) the governor has approved all certifications and supporting material submitted under (4) of this section as being in the best public interest, and has certified that the contract required by AS 19.40.020 has been executed.

###### Sec. 19.40.065.   Regulations and penalties.

All departments and agencies of the state are given the specific authority to adopt under AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) emergency, temporary, and permanent regulations necessary to accomplish the purposes of AS 19.40.020§19.40.050.  The violation of any regulation adopted under AS 19.40.020§19.40.050 is a misdemeanor and upon conviction the person is punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000 for each offense.

###### Sec. 19.40.070.   Conflict with other laws.

In the event of a conflict between this chapter and any other law of this state, the provisions of this chapter govern and supersede any such other law.

###### Sec. 19.40.080.   [Renumbered as AS 19.40.290.]

Renumbered as AS 19.40.290.

Renumbered as AS 19.40.290.
