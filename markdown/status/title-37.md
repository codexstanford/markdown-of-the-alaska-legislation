## Chapter 06. Capital Project Matching Grant Programs.

###### Sec. 37.06.010.   Municipal capital project matching grant program.

(a) The municipal capital project matching grant program is established in the department. Grants to municipalities under this program shall be administered as provided in this section.

(b) The municipal capital project matching grant fund is established in the department and consists of appropriations to the fund. Appropriations to the fund do not lapse except as provided in (f) of this section. The money in the fund is held by the department in custody under this subsection for each municipality. The department shall establish, for each municipality, an individual grant account within the fund. As provided in this subsection, each fiscal year the department shall allocate, to the individual grant accounts, appropriations to the fund. The department shall credit interest earned on money in an individual grant account to that account. Except as provided in (c) of this section, the amount allocated under this subsection to an individual grant account in a fiscal year is determined by multiplying the total amount appropriated to the fund during that fiscal year by a fraction,

(1) the numerator of which equals for a municipality with a population

(A) under 1,000, the amount equal to that population multiplied by 1.5;

(B) of at least 1,000 but less than 5,000, the amount equal to that population multiplied by 1.4;

(C) of at least 5,000 but not greater than 10,000, the amount equal to that population multiplied by 1.2;

(D) of over 10,000, the amount equal to that population; and

(2) the denominator of which equals the sum of the numerators calculated for all municipalities under (1)(A)§(D) of this subsection.

(c) A minimum of $25,000 shall be allocated to each municipality's individual grant account each fiscal year under (b) of this section. The department shall reduce allocations under (b) of this section on a pro rata basis, based upon the population of the municipalities, if necessary to fund the minimum amount for each municipality. If appropriations are not sufficient to fully fund the minimum amount for each municipality, the amount appropriated shall be allocated equally among the municipalities' individual grant accounts.

(d) By October 1 of each fiscal year, each municipality shall submit to the governor a prioritized list of capital projects and estimated costs to be financed with money from the municipality's individual grant account established under (b) of this section. The list must include the amount and source of the local share required by AS 37.06.030. The governor shall include in the capital improvements program presented to the legislature under AS 37.07.060 the projects submitted by each municipality that the governor recommends for funding. If, in the capital improvements program, the governor includes projects in other than the priority order submitted by a municipality, the governor shall provide the legislature with a written statement of the reasons for that action.

(e) The legislature may make appropriations from a municipality's individual grant account established under (b) of this section to the municipality for capital projects under this section. Subject to appropriations under this subsection and to the local share requirements of AS 37.06.030, each municipality may draw amounts from its individual grant account for a capital project, in accordance with an appropriation for that project. In accepting a draw, the municipality covenants with the state that it will provide for the operation and maintenance of the capital project for which the draw is used for the practical life of the project, and acknowledges that the state is not responsible for operating or maintaining the capital project or for paying for its operation or maintenance. This requirement does not apply to use of money from a draw for repair or improvement of an existing facility that is operated or maintained by the state at the time that the draw is made if the repair or improvement for which the draw is used will not substantially increase the operating or maintenance costs to the state. No more than 10 percent of the total amount of money from a draw for land acquisition, or planning, design, construction, or repair of a facility may be used for administrative expenses. No more than five percent of the total amount of money from a draw for equipment or equipment repairs may be used for administrative expenses. If a municipality provides grant money from a draw to another recipient, the municipality may not use any of the money from the draw for administrative expenses. The municipality and its agents, contractors, and subcontractors shall comply with the hiring preferences under AS 36.10 in hiring employees to be paid wholly or in part with money from a draw.

(f) A municipality shall repay to the department money drawn from its individual grant account if substantial, ongoing work on the capital project is not started within five years after the effective date of the appropriation from which the draw is funded. Money repaid shall be deposited into the general fund. Money from an allocation to a municipality's individual grant account that has not been drawn out by the municipality within five years after the effective date of the appropriation from which the allocation is funded lapses into the general fund.

(g) For purposes of this section, in calculating the population of a borough, the population of each city in the borough is excluded. The determination of population shall be based on the latest figures of the United States Bureau of the Census or other population data that the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development determines is reliable.

(h) The provisions of AS 37.05.321 apply to a grant and draws made under this section, and to earnings from the grant and draws.

(i) Before the department may pay a draw under this section to a municipality, the department shall have evidence acceptable to the department that the municipality

(1) has a preventive maintenance plan that

(A) includes a computerized maintenance management program, cardex system, or other formal systematic means of tracking the timing and costs associated with planned and completed maintenance activities, including scheduled preventive maintenance;

(B) addresses energy management for buildings owned or operated by the municipality;

(C) includes a regular custodial care program for buildings owned or operated by the municipality;

(D) includes preventive maintenance training for facility managers and maintenance employees;

(E) includes renewal and replacement schedules for electrical, mechanical, structural, and other components of facilities owned or operated by the municipality; and

(2) is adequately adhering to the preventive maintenance plan.

(j) In this section, unless specified otherwise, "department" means the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development.

###### Sec. 37.06.020.   Unincorporated community capital project matching grant program.

(a) The unincorporated community capital project matching grant program is established in the department. Grants to unincorporated communities under the program shall be administered as provided in this section.

(b) The unincorporated community capital project matching grant fund is established in the department and consists of appropriations to the fund. Appropriations to the fund do not lapse except as provided in (h) of this section. The money in the fund is held by the department in custody under this subsection for each unincorporated community eligible for an allocation under this subsection. The department shall establish an individual grant account within the fund for each unincorporated community that was entitled to receive state aid under AS 29.60.855 during the preceding fiscal year. As provided in this subsection, each fiscal year, the department shall allocate, to the individual grant accounts, appropriations to the fund. An unincorporated community is eligible for an allocation in a fiscal year if the community was eligible to receive state aid under AS 29.60.855 during the preceding fiscal year. The department shall credit interest earned on money in an individual grant account to that account. Except as provided in (c) of this section, the amount allocated under this subsection to an individual grant account in a fiscal year is determined by dividing the total amount appropriated to the fund during that fiscal year by the number of unincorporated communities eligible for an allocation during that fiscal year.

(c) A minimum of $25,000 shall be allocated to each eligible unincorporated community's grant account each fiscal year under (b) of this section. If appropriations are not sufficient to fully fund the minimum amount for each eligible unincorporated community, the amount appropriated shall be allocated equally among the eligible unincorporated communities.

(d) The department shall designate, in each eligible unincorporated community, an incorporated nonprofit entity or a Native village council that agrees to receive and spend grant money allocated to the unincorporated community's individual grant account under (b) of this section. If there is more than one qualified entity in a community, the department shall designate the entity that the department finds most qualified to make draws from that unincorporated community's individual grant account and spend the money. If there is no qualified incorporated nonprofit entity or Native village council in an unincorporated community that will agree to receive and spend money allocated to the community under (b) of this section, draws may not be made from the unincorporated community's individual grant account and the amount allocated to the account lapses into the general fund.

(e) By October 1 of each fiscal year, the incorporated nonprofit entity or Native village council designated by the department under (d) of this section shall submit to the governor a prioritized list of capital projects and estimated costs to be financed with money from the community's individual grant account established under (b) of this section. The list must include the amount and source of the local share required by AS 37.06.030. The governor shall include in the capital improvements program presented to the legislature under AS 37.07.060 the projects submitted by designated entities under this subsection that the governor recommends for funding. If, in the capital improvements program, the governor includes projects in other than the priority order submitted by a designated entity, the governor shall provide the legislature with a written statement of the reasons for that action.

(f) The legislature may make appropriations, from an unincorporated community's individual grant account established under (b) of this section, for the unincorporated community for capital projects under this section. Subject to appropriations under this subsection and to the local share requirements of AS 37.06.030, an entity designated by the department under (d) of this section may draw, on behalf of the unincorporated community, amounts from that community's individual grant account for a capital project in accordance with an appropriation for that project. In accepting a draw, an entity designated by the department under (d) of this section acknowledges that the state is not responsible for operating or maintaining a capital project for which the draw is used, or for paying for its operation or maintenance. The acknowledgment does not apply to use of money from a draw for repair or improvement of an existing facility that is operated or maintained by the state at the time that the draw is made if the repair or improvement for which the draw is used will not substantially increase the operating or maintenance costs to the state. No more than 10 percent of the total amount of money from a draw for land acquisition, or planning, design, construction, or repair of a facility may be used for administrative expenses. No more than five percent of the total amount of money from a draw for equipment or equipment repairs may be used for administrative expenses. The designated entity and its agents, contractors, and subcontractors shall comply with the hiring preferences under AS 36.10 in hiring employees to be paid wholly or in part with money from a draw.

(g) An entity designated by the department under (d) of this section that is a Native village council may not draw money from an unincorporated community's individual grant account unless the council waives immunity from suit for claims arising out of activities of the council related to the draw. A waiver of immunity from suit under this subsection must be on a form provided by the Department of Law. Neither this subsection nor any action taken under it enlarges or diminishes the governmental authority or jurisdiction of a Native village council.

(h) An entity designated by the department under (d) of this section shall repay to the department money it has drawn from an unincorporated community's individual grant account if substantial, ongoing work on the project is not started within five years after the effective date of the appropriation from which the draw is funded. Money repaid shall be deposited into the general fund. Money from an allocation to an unincorporated community's individual grant account that has not been drawn out by a designated entity within five years after the effective date of the appropriation from which the allocation is funded lapses into the general fund.

(i) The limitations of AS 44.33.745 do not apply to a grant made under this section.

(j) The provisions of AS 37.05.321 apply to a grant and draws made under this section, and to earnings from the grant and draws.

(k) Before the department may pay a draw under this section to an entity, the department shall have evidence acceptable to the department that the entity

(1) has a preventive maintenance plan that

(A) includes a computerized maintenance management program, cardex system, or other formal systematic means of tracking the timing and costs associated with planned and completed maintenance activities, including scheduled preventive maintenance;

(B) addresses energy management for public buildings owned or operated by the entity;

(C) includes a regular custodial care program for public buildings owned or operated by the entity;

(D) includes preventive maintenance training for managers of public facilities owned or operated by the entity and maintenance employees;

(E) includes renewal and replacement schedules for electrical, mechanical, structural, and other components of public facilities owned or operated by the entity; and

(2) is adequately adhering to the preventive maintenance plan.

(l) In this section, unless specified otherwise, "department" means the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development.

###### Sec. 37.06.030.   Local share requirements.

(a) For each draw made by a municipality under AS 37.06.010, the municipality shall contribute a local share to the cost of the capital project for which the draw is made. The amount of the local share equals the local share percentage as calculated under (1) of this subsection, divided by the state share percentage as calculated under (2) of this subsection, multiplied by the amount of the draw. For purposes of this subsection,

(1) the local share percentage is

(A) 30 percent for a municipality with a population of 5,000 or more;

(B) for a municipality with a population of 1,000§4,999, the greater of

(C) for a municipality with a population of under 1,000, the greater of

(i) five percent; or

(ii) the percentage obtained by dividing the amount that would be received by the municipality from a property tax levy of 1/1000th of a mill for each $1,000 of grant funds received by the sum of that first amount plus the amount of the grant or draw, but not more than 30 percent;

(2) the state share percentage equals one minus the local share percentage;

(b) For each draw made by an entity or council under AS 37.06.020, the incorporated entity or Native village council that makes the draw shall contribute a local share of the cost of the capital project for which the draw is made. The amount of the local share equals the local share percentage as calculated under (1) of this subsection, divided by the state share percentage as calculated under (2) of this subsection, multiplied by the amount of the draw. For purposes of this subsection,

(1) the local share percentage is five percent;

(2) the state share percentage equals one minus the local share percentage;

(3) the local share may be satisfied from (A) federal or local money; (B) labor, materials, or equipment used directly in the construction of the project, or land, including land transferred by the state; the department shall determine the value of a contribution under this subparagraph; (C) money from another nonstate source; (D) money received by the unincorporated community under AS 29.60.850§29.60.879; or (E) money obtained from the sale or lease of land or other assets transferred by the state; except as provided in this paragraph, the local share may not be satisfied with money from, or with the portion of an asset that was obtained with money from, an appropriation, allocation, entitlement, grant, or other payment from the state.

An entity organized under federal law as an Indian reserve that existed before enactment of 43 U.S.C. 1618(a) and is continued in existence under that subsection is a municipality for purposes of AS 37.06.010§37.06.090 and may not receive a grant under AS 37.06.020. In addition to other eligibility requirements applicable to municipalities, to qualify to receive a grant under AS 37.06.010, a municipality organized under federal law as an Indian reserve shall form a community development corporation with authority to determine how the grant money will be used. The corporation's charter must require that the governing board of the corporation shall be elected at an annual election open to all residents of the municipality who are registered and qualified to vote in state elections. The Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development may distribute money for the municipality only to a corporation organized in accordance with this section and only after the corporation has delivered a written waiver of sovereign immunity from legal action by the state to recover all or a portion of the money distributed under AS 37.06.010.

Unless specifically exempted by statute, a state agency authorized to collect or receive fees, licenses, taxes, or other money belonging to the state shall account for and remit the receipts, less fees to which the collector is entitled by statute or regulation, to the Department of Revenue at least once each month. The commissioner of administration shall separately account under AS 37.05.142 for receipts deposited under this subsection. A fee or other charge that is set by regulation may not exceed the estimated actual costs of the state agency in administering the activity or providing the service unless otherwise provided by the statute under which the regulation is adopted; however, this limitation does not apply to sale or lease of property by a state agency, fees charged by a resource agency for a designated regulatory service as defined in AS 37.10.058, fees adopted by the Department of Natural Resources under AS 41.21.026(f), AS 44.37.025, and 44.37.027, or fees, rents, tolls, and other charges established or levied by the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities for the use of the Knik Arm bridge and appurtenant facilities.

(a) Each resource agency shall, by regulation, establish a list of fixed fees for standard designated regulatory services that it provides. A fixed fee adopted under this subsection may not exceed the estimated average reasonable direct cost incurred by the resource agency in providing the standard designated regulatory service. The resource agency shall provide an explanation of the basis for the fixed fee. The resource agency shall review the list of fixed fees at least once every four years, identify any changes in the average actual and reasonable direct cost of providing each standard designated regulatory service for which a fixed fee has been established, and, by regulation, adjust the fees accordingly. The agency shall include the results of its review in the report submitted under AS 37.10.050(c).

(b) In the case of a designated regulatory service for which a resource agency has not established a fixed fee under (a) of this section, a resource agency shall, at the request of the person who will be billed for a designated regulatory service, attempt to reach a negotiated service agreement for provision of that service. A negotiated service agreement that is reached under this subsection is a contract that is enforceable by either party under generally applicable contract remedies provided by law. A negotiated service agreement reached under this subsection may include

(2) the structure or methodology by which the fee will be charged;

(3) deadlines, sequences, or milestones for the provision of the regulatory service; and

(4) other matters reasonably related to the cost of, or procedures for, the provision of the regulatory service.

(c) A person requiring more than one regulatory service, at least one of which is a designated regulatory service, for an activity may petition the resource agency that will provide the services or, if more than one resource agency will provide a regulatory service, the office of management and budget to establish a single fee for all regulatory services that are required for that class of activities. The resource agency or office of management and budget, as appropriate, shall grant the petition if it finds that the proposed fee meets the applicable requirements of this subsection and is likely to be used by the resource agency or office of management and budget more than once. If a petition under this subsection is granted, the resource agency or the office of management and budget shall make available to the public information concerning the single fee, including a list of regulatory services to be provided and the amount of the fee. If the resource agency or the office of management and budget denies the petition, the agency or office shall provide to the petitioner a statement setting out the agency's or office's reasons for denial. The single fee under this subsection must be

(1) confined to the distinct economic sector in which the petitioner is or proposes to be engaged;

(2) where necessary, limited by geography, facility size or capacity, or other relevant factors so as to provide a reasonable assurance that only similarly situated activities, with respect to cost, are included within the fixed fee; and

(3) based on the estimated average reasonable direct cost of each designated regulatory service required for the activity and the average fee customarily charged for a regulatory service other than a designated regulatory service discounted by the amount of savings that may be achieved by avoiding regulatory overlap and, where applicable, coordinating multi-agency review of the activity to the maximum extent possible.

(d) Except for fees determined under (a), (b), or (c) of this section or in AS 37.10.056, a fee levied by a resource agency for a designated regulatory service must be based solely on the actual and reasonable direct cost incurred by the resource agency in providing the designated regulatory service to the person on whom that fee is levied, computed on a time-and-expense basis.

(e) Nothing in this section authorizes or requires a resource agency to charge a fee for a designated regulatory service.

(f) No action taken by a resource agency or the office of management and budget under (c) of this section is subject to AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act).

###### Sec. 37.10.054.   Invoices for designated regulatory services.

(a) Unless a negotiated service agreement reached under AS 37.10.052(b) or (c) provides otherwise, a resource agency charging a fee for providing a designated regulatory service other than a standard designated regulatory service for which a fixed fee has been established under AS 37.10.052(a) shall, on a monthly basis, provide the person who will be billed for the service with an invoice for services performed during that month. The invoice must be reasonably convenient to the reader, and reasonably susceptible to audit. The invoice must set out, in time increments of not greater than one-quarter hour for each employee, and separately for each expenditure, the purpose of the time or expenditure in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable person to determine whether the time or cost was an actual and reasonable direct cost.

(b) If a person believes that an invoice rendered under (a) of this section exceeds the actual and reasonable direct cost of providing the designated regulatory service, the person may, within 30 days after receiving the invoice, request that the resource agency review the invoice. The resource agency shall review the invoice under the standards of this section and issue its final decision on the invoice within 30 days of receipt of a request for review.

###### Sec. 37.10.056.   Petitions to adopt regulations.

A person requiring a designated regulatory service from a resource agency may petition the resource agency under AS 44.62.220 and 44.62.230 to adopt regulations that would establish, for a category of designated regulatory services, a fixed fee that is

(1) confined to the distinct economic sector in which the petitioner is or proposes to be engaged;

(2) where necessary, limited by geography, facility size or capacity, or other relevant factors so as to provide a reasonable assurance that only similarly situated regulatory services, with respect to cost, are included within the fixed fee;

(3) likely to be used by the resource agency more than once; and

(4) based on the average reasonable direct cost incurred by the agency in providing the designated regulatory service.

When adopting regulations authorized by this section or managing and investing fund assets, the prudent-investor rule shall be applied by the corporation. The prudent-investor rule as applied to investment activity of the fund means that the corporation shall exercise the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that an institutional investor of ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercises in the designation and management of large investments entrusted to it, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of funds, considering preservation of the purchasing power of the fund over time while maximizing the expected total return from both income and the appreciation of capital.

(b) The corporation may not borrow money or guarantee from principal of the fund the obligations of others, except as provided in this subsection. With respect to investments of the fund, the corporation may, either directly or through an entity in which the investment is made, borrow money if the borrowing is nonrecourse to the corporation and the fund.

(c) The board shall maintain a reasonable diversification among investments unless, under the circumstances, it is clearly prudent not to do so.

(2) are eligible for investment of fund assets under (a) of this section.

(d) The corporation may enter into and enforce all contracts necessary, convenient, or desirable for managing the fund's assets and corporate operations, including contracts for future delivery to implement asset allocation strategies or to hedge an existing equivalent ownership position in an investment.

Income available for distribution equals 21 percent of the net income of the fund for the last five fiscal years, including the fiscal year just ended, but may not exceed net income of the fund for the fiscal year just ended plus the balance in the earnings reserve account described in AS 37.13.145.

The amount available for appropriation is five percent of the average market value of the fund for the first five of the preceding six fiscal years, including the fiscal year just ended, computed annually for each fiscal year in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In this subsection, "average market value of the fund" includes the balance of the earnings reserve account established under AS 37.13.145, but does not include that portion of the principal attributed to the settlement of State v.

(c) After the transfer under (b) and an appropriation under (e) of this section, the corporation shall transfer from the earnings reserve account to the principal of the fund an amount sufficient to offset the effect of inflation on the principal of the fund during that fiscal year. However, none of the amount transferred shall be applied to increase the value of that portion of the principal attributed to the settlement of State v. Amerada Hess, et al., 1JU-77-847 Civ. (Superior Court, First Judicial District) on July 1, 2004. The corporation shall calculate the amount to transfer to the principal under this subsection by

(1) computing the average of the monthly United States Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers for each of the two previous calendar years;

(2) computing the percentage change between the first and second calendar year average; and

(3) applying that rate to the value of the principal of the fund on the last day of the fiscal year just ended, including that portion of the principal attributed to the settlement of State v. Amerada Hess, et al., 1JU-77-847 Civ. (Superior Court, First Judicial District).

(d) Notwithstanding (b) of this section, income earned on money awarded in or received as a result of State v. Amerada Hess, et al., 1JU-77-847 Civ.

###### Sec. 37.13.150.   Corporation budget.

The revenue generated by the fund's investments must be identified as the source of the operating budget of the corporation in the state's operating budget under AS 37.07 (Executive Budget Act). The unexpended balance of the corporation's annual operating budget does not lapse at the end of the fiscal year but shall be treated as income and part of the market value of the fund under AS 37.13.140.

###### Sec. 37.13.160.   Audits.

The Legislative Budget and Audit Committee may provide for an annual post audit and annual operational and performance evaluations of the fund's investments and investment programs.

###### Sec. 37.13.170.   Reports and publications.

Confidential information may be disclosed only for the purposes of an official law enforcement investigation or when its production is required in a court proceeding.  These restrictions do not prohibit the publication of statistics presented in a manner that prevents the identification of particular reports, items, persons, or enterprises.

A regulation adopted, amended, or repealed by the board may vary from the informative summary specified in (d) of this section if the subject of the action taken on the regulation remains the same and if the original notice of the proposed action was written so as to ensure that members of the public are reasonably notified of the subject of the proposed action in order for members of the public to determine whether their interests could be affected by the board's proposed action on that subject.

(2) all proceeds of bonds required to be deposited in the fund by terms of the bond resolution or a trust agreement with respect to the proceeds of bonds.

(b) Subject to (h) of this section, money in the reserve fund shall be held and applied solely to the payment of the interest on and principal of bonds authorized under AS 37.15.225§37.15.290 as the interest and principal become due and payable to the retirement of bonds. Money may not be withdrawn if a withdrawal would reduce the amount in the reserve fund to an amount less than the required debt service reserve except for payment of interest then due and payable on bonds and the principal of bonds then maturing and payable and for the retirement of bonds in accordance with the terms of the bond resolution or trust agreement and for which payment is not then available.

(d) Money in the reserve fund may be invested in the same manner and on the same conditions as permitted for investment of funds belonging to the state or held in the treasury under AS 37.10.070; however, the committee or the committee's delegated representative may agree with the bondholders to further limit these investments.

The committee may, at any time, issue bonds or notes for the purpose of increasing the amount in the reserve fund to the required debt service reserve, or to meet whatever higher or additional reserve that may be fixed by a bond resolution or trust agreement with respect to the fund.

(g) To ensure the required debt service reserve is maintained in the reserve fund, the legislature may appropriate annually for deposit in the fund the sum, certified by the commissioner of revenue to the governor and to the legislature, that is necessary to restore the fund to an amount equal to the required debt service reserve. The commissioner of revenue annually, before January 30, shall make and deliver to the governor and to the legislature a certificate stating the sum required to restore the fund to that amount, and the certified sum may be appropriated during the then current state fiscal year. Nothing in this subsection creates a debt or liability of the state.
