(b) The department shall select one or more competent persons to make examinations of financial institutions. The examiner shall take and subscribe an oath that

(1) the examiner will honestly and impartially examine into and report the condition of the institution as to assets and liabilities and other information required by the department;

(2) the examiner will not disclose the information the examiner obtains through the examination to a person other than the department;

(3) at the time of employment, the examiner is not obligated to, or the owner of an interest in, the institution and is not an officer or shareholder of the institution;

(4) the examiner does not own more than five percent of the voting shares in another financial institution in the state; and

(a) Notwithstanding other provisions of this title, the department may by order authorize state financial institutions, except licensees subject to AS 06.20, AS 06.40, or AS 06.50, to exercise any of the powers conferred upon, or to be subject to any of the limitations imposed upon, a federally chartered financial institution doing business in this state with deposits insured by an agency of the federal government if the department finds that the exercise of the power or imposition of the limitation both

(1) serves the public convenience and advantage; and

(1) authorized in writing by the depositor or customer;

(2) required by federal or state statute or regulation or by an order directed to the financial institution and issued by a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction;

(3) made to the holder of a negotiable instrument drawn on the financial institution as to whether the drawer has sufficient funds in the financial institution to cover the instrument;

(c) Unless otherwise provided in this subsection, when disclosure of financial institution records is required under a court or administrative agency order under (a)(2) of this section, the financial institution shall notify the depositor or customer of the disclosure before the disclosure is made. If notification before disclosure is not possible, the financial institution shall notify the customer or depositor of the disclosure as soon as practicable after the disclosure is made. However, notification either before or after disclosure may not be made if disclosure is made under a court or administrative agency order under (a)(2) of this section and the document requiring disclosure requires on its face that the financial institution not notify or inform the depositor or customer, or the document requiring disclosure is, or is accompanied by, a court order that expressly directs the financial institution not to notify or inform the depositor or customer.

(2) the person receiving the information has a written agreement with the financial institution to be bound by the requirements of (a) — (c) of this section.

(e) Nothing in this section authorizes the disclosure of information if disclosure is prohibited by 15 U.S.C. 6801 — 6827 or the regulations adopted under those sections.

(f) A financial institution or any other person who violates this section is liable to a depositor or customer for damages caused by the disclosure of the confidential records or information of the financial institution pertaining to the depositor or customer.

(c) A cease and desist order issued under (b) of this section may impose a penalty under AS 06.01.035(e) — (g) and may require the person to cease and desist from the act or practice and to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from the act or practice.

A temporary cease and desist order issued under this subsection remains in effect until a final order is issued under (b) of this section or until otherwise terminated by the department, except that the order may not remain in effect for more than 60 days.

###### Sec. 06.20.060.   Issuance of license.

Upon the filing of the application, the payment of the fees and the approval of the bond, the department shall issue a license to the applicant if it finds upon investigation that (1) the financial responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness of the applicant and of its members if the applicant is a copartnership or association, and of its officers and directors if the applicant is a corporation, are such as to command the confidence of the community and to warrant belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and efficiently within the purposes of this chapter, and (2) allowing the applicant to engage in business at the location will provide accessibility and convenience for borrowers of money, and (3) the applicant has available for the operation of the business at the specific location liquid assets of at least $25,000, or, in the case of a multiple office license, that the equivalent amount is available to each office from a central account maintained by the applicant. The foregoing facts are conditions precedent to the issuance of a license under this chapter. The license permits the applicant to make loans in accordance with this chapter at the location or locations specified in the application. The license remains in full force and effect until it is surrendered by the licensee or revoked or suspended. If the department denies the application, it shall notify the applicant of the denial, bill the applicant for any outstanding expenses incurred by the department during the investigation and return the bond if those expenses have been paid. The department shall approve or deny every application for license within 60 days from the filing of the application with the fees and the approved bond. If the application is denied, the department shall, within 20 days thereafter, serve upon the applicant a copy of the written decision and findings.

(b) If a licensee changes the place of business to another location within the same municipality, the licensee shall give written notice to the department in advance. Upon approval, the department shall issue an amended license for the new location. A licensee may not change the place of business to a location outside the municipality in which the licensee is authorized to do business.

(2) the licensee has violated a provision of this chapter or a regulation lawfully adopted by the department under and within the authority of this chapter; or

A revocation, suspension, or surrender of a license does not impair or affect the legally enforceable obligation of any pre-existing contract between the licensee and any borrower.

Every license remains in force and effect until it is surrendered, revoked, or suspended as provided in this chapter.

###### Sec. 06.20.160.   Inspection and examination of licensees.

For the purpose of discovering violations of this chapter or securing information required by it under this chapter, the department or its duly designated representative may investigate at any time the loans and business and examine the books, accounts, records, and files used in the business, of every licensee and of every person engaging in the business described in AS 06.20.010, whether the person acts or claims to act as principal or agent, or under or without the authority of this chapter.

The maintenance of separate books and records for another business authorized by the department under AS 06.20.210 is not required. The method of tracking and numbering the loans shall be determined by the licensee, as long as the system enables the department to perform the department's obligations under this title.

###### Sec. 06.20.190.   Annual reports of licensees.

A licensee may not transact business or make any loan under this chapter under any name or at any place of business other than that named in the license.

A licensee may not induce or permit a person, or a husband and wife jointly or severally, to split up or divide a loan or to become obligated, directly or contingently or both, under more than one loan contract at the same time, for the purpose or with the result of obtaining a higher rate of interest than would otherwise be permitted by AS 06.20.230. However, a licensee may enter into new or different loan transactions with the borrower or the borrower's spouse at a different time so long as the purpose of the additional transaction does not violate this section.

(a) Interest may not be paid, deducted, or received in advance. Except for open-end loans made under AS 06.20.285, interest shall be computed and paid only on unpaid principal balances and may not be compounded; however, if part or all of the consideration for a loan contract is the unpaid principal balance of a prior loan, the principal amount payable under the loan contract may include any unpaid charges on the prior loan that have accrued within 60 days before the making of the loan contract.  The maximum interest permitted on loans made under this chapter shall be computed on the basis of the number of days actually elapsed. For the purpose of these computations a month is any period of 30 consecutive days.

(b) A licensee may compute interest for a loan as provided in this chapter on an interest-bearing or actuarial basis either at the rates stated in AS 06.20.230 or at the single annual percentage rate that would earn the same finance charge as the rates stated in AS 06.20.230 when the debt is paid according to the agreed terms and the calculations made according to the actuarial method.

(c) Except for open-end loans under AS 06.20.285, a licensee may not enter into a contract for a loan that provides for a scheduled repayment of principal over more than the maximum terms set out below opposite the respective size of loans.

(e) If the irregular payment is confirmed in writing by the borrower, and the method of repayment is consistent with the maximum term and annual interest rate provided in this chapter, and if a borrower demonstrates sufficient seasonal or extraordinary income to support repayment of a loan, the loan contract may provide for irregular payments and first payment extensions greater than 45 days from the date the loan is made.

###### Sec. 06.20.260.   Charges prohibited.

(2) premiums actually paid out for insurance on any one or combination of the following: pledged property of the borrower, or consumer credit insurance; in this paragraph, “consumer credit insurance” has the meaning given in AS 21.57.160;

(5) for loans over $10,000, whether or not secured by an interest in real estate, reasonable costs and fees paid by a licensee for appraisals, surveys, title insurance or reports, and credit reports;

(6) a late payment fee of not more than 10 percent of the payment that is due or $25, whichever is less;

(7) a fee for dishonored checks not to exceed $25 for each dishonored check;

(8) reasonable attorney fees, actual expenses, and costs incurred in connection with the collection of a delinquent debt or a foreclosure if the collection or foreclosure is referred to an attorney who is not a salaried employee of the licensee and the balance then owing on the debt exceeds $5,000;

(9) actual expenses and costs incurred in connection with a repossession.

(b) A licensee may collect the charges permitted under (a) of this section at the time when the loan is made or at any time thereafter.  If any interest, consideration, or charges in excess of those permitted by AS 06.20.230 are charged, contracted for, or received, except as the result of an accidental and bona fide error in computation, the contract of loan is modified as follows: all interest, consideration, or charges involved are voided and a like amount credited to the debtor on the principal of the loan. If the unpaid principal is less than the total of the interest, consideration, and charges, the difference shall be refunded by the lender to the borrower.

(b) The billing cycle for open-end loans is monthly, and the unpaid principal balance on a certain day is computed by adding to the balance unpaid on the beginning of that day, or the average unpaid daily balance for that billing cycle, all advances and other permissible amounts charged to the borrower and deducting all payments and other credits made or received that day.

(c) A licensee may secure the payment of an open-end loan in the same manner as other loans under this chapter may be secured.

(d) The licensee shall deliver a copy of the open-end loan agreement to the borrower at the time the open-end loan account is opened.

(e) At the end of each billing cycle in which there is an outstanding balance in the account for which a finance charge is imposed, the licensee shall deliver to the borrower a statement in the form required by regulations adopted by the department and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

(2) any transfer of trust company assets made after or in contemplation of the trust company's insolvency or in anticipation of the department's takeover, with intent to effect a preference of one creditor over another creditor or to prevent the distribution of the trust company assets according to law, is void.

(b) A plan of reorganization may not be established under this chapter unless, in the opinion of the department,

(1) the plan is fair to all classes of depositors, other customers, creditors, and shareholders;

(2) subject to a fair adjustment for new capital that a class will pay under the plan, the face amount of the trust company asset interest provided to a class of depositors, other customers, creditors, or shareholders under the plan does not exceed the value of the assets at liquidation less the full amount of the claims of all prior classes;

###### Sec. 06.26.780.   Involuntary liquidation powers.

(a) When liquidating a trust company, the department may exercise any power incidental to liquidating a trust company, but it may not, without the approval of the superior court,

(c) As soon as practical after beginning the involuntary liquidation of a trust company, the department shall take the steps necessary to terminate all fiduciary positions held by the trust company, to surrender all property held by the trust company as a fiduciary, and to settle the trust accounts of the trust company.

The specified day may not be less than 60 days from the date of the first publication of the notice.

The court shall hear and determine the filed objections after the notice to the department and interested claimants that the court establishes. If the court sustains an objection, the court shall direct that the schedule be modified appropriately.

(f) After filing its schedule, the department may make partial distribution to the holders of the claims that are undisputed or are allowed by the court if an adequate reserve is established for the payment of disputed claims. As soon as practicable after the determination of all objections, the department shall make the final distribution.

(g) The following claims have priority in liquidation proceedings, in the order listed:

(1) obligations incurred by the department in liquidating the trust company;

(2) wages and salaries of officers and employees earned during the three-month period preceding the department's possession in an amount not exceeding $3,000 for each person;

(3) fees and assessments owed by the trust company to the department;

(4) deposits;

(5) claims secured by trust company assets.

(h) After the payment of all other claims, including interest at the rate of 10.5 percent a year, the department shall pay claims that are otherwise valid but that were not filed within the time prescribed.

(i) If the sum available for a class of creditors is insufficient to provide payment in full, the sum shall be distributed pro rata to the claimants in the class.

(j) Unclaimed property remaining after the completion of the liquidation proceedings under this section is presumed abandoned, and the property shall be delivered to the Department of Revenue for handling under AS 34.45.110 — 34.45.780.

(k) After payment of the expenses of the liquidation and the claims against the trust company arising from its fiduciary obligations in this state under AS 06.26.760 — 06.26.800, the receiver shall distribute any remaining money or other assets from the liquidation of the trust company's fiduciary operations in this state equitably among, as applicable, the receivers for liquidation of the trust company's fiduciary operations in other states of the United States and under the laws of the United States, for payment of the expenses of liquidation and claims against the trust company's fiduciary operations. If the trust company's fiduciary operations are not being liquidated in another state or under the laws of the United States, the receiver shall, after satisfying the requirements of AS 06.26.760 — 06.26.800, pay any remaining money or other assets from the liquidation of the trust company's fiduciary operations in this state to the trust company.

(l) When the receiver has completed the liquidation of the trust company's fiduciary operations in this state, the receiver shall, with notice to the department, petition the court for an order declaring the trust company's fiduciary operations in this state properly wound up under AS 06.26.760 — 06.26.800. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall proceed as provided in AS 06.26.760 — 06.26.800.

(m) An order issued by the court under a petition filed under (l) of this section may only declare the trust company's fiduciary operations in this state have been properly wound up and may not declare the trust company is dissolved. The court may make whatever additional orders and grant whatever additional relief that the court determines is proper under the evidence submitted.

(n) After an order is issued under (m) of this section declaring the trust company's fiduciary operations in this state are properly wound up,

Upon filing with the court a certificate indicating the acceptance of the appointment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor, the possession of and title to all the assets, business, and property of the trust company are transferred to that corporation. The department is then relieved of all responsibility and liability with respect to the reorganization or liquidation of the trust company. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor may liquidate, reorganize, merge, or consolidate the trust company in the manner permitted by the laws of the United States or by this chapter, and possesses all the rights, powers, duties, and obligations of the department in the liquidation, reorganization, merger, or consolidation of the trust company under this chapter.
