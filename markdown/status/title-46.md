An oral or written contract that would transfer, sell, lease, rent, or otherwise allow the use of the property in violation of this subsection is voidable between the parties at the option of the purchaser, transferee, user, lessee, or renter. However, this subsection does not

(1) make voidable a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness or a mortgage, trust deed, or other security interest securing the promissory note or evidence of indebtedness, if the note or evidence of indebtedness, mortgage, trust deed, or other security interest was given to a person other than the person transferring, selling, using, leasing, or renting the property to induce the person to finance the transfer, sale, use, leasing, or rental of the property;

(2) make voidable a lease or rental agreement between the property owner and the person who caused the property to be contaminated and determined unfit for use; or

(3) impair obligations or duties required to be performed on termination of a contract, as required by the contract, such as payment of damages or return of refundable deposits.

(b) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, property covered by (a) of this section may be transferred or sold if full written disclosure is made to the prospective transferee or purchaser that the property has been determined to be an illegal drug manufacturing site and the property has not been determined to be fit for use. The disclosure shall be attached to the earnest money receipt, if any, and shall accompany the transfer or sale document. The disclosure is not considered to be part of the transfer or sale document, however, and may not be recorded. The property shall continue to be subject to the restrictions in (a) of this section after transfer or sale under this subsection.

(c) A person who knowingly transfers, sells, leases, or rents property to another, knowingly allows another to use or occupy property, or, being the owner of property, knowingly occupies or uses the property in violation of this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor. In this subsection, "knowingly" has the meaning given in AS 11.81.900(a).

(d) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under (c) of this section for allowing another to use or occupy the property that the defendant or an agent of the defendant, within four days after receiving a notice under AS 46.03.500, filed an appropriate civil action to remove the user or occupier from the property for which the notice was received.

###### Sec. 46.03.520.   Sampling and testing procedures.

(a) If the owner of the property for which notice was received under AS 46.03.500(b) desires to determine if the property is fit for use, the owner shall cause the site to be sampled and tested for the substances covered in regulations adopted under AS 46.03.530, using the procedures and laboratory services specified under (b) and (c) of this section. The property owner shall inform the laboratory used for sampling or testing under this subsection that the sampling and testing are related to property that has been determined to be an illegal drug manufacturing site.

(b) The department shall establish procedures for sampling and testing property that may have been an illegal drug manufacturing site.

(c) The department shall establish and maintain a list of laboratories in the state that have notified the department that they have the capacity to perform the sampling and testing procedures and that they wish to be on the list maintained under this subsection. A laboratory may not be included on the list unless the laboratory agrees to send the department a copy of test results related to properties whose owners have informed the laboratory that the test results are for property that has been determined to be an illegal drug manufacturing site.

###### Sec. 46.03.530.   Standards for determining fitness.

(a) Property for which a notice was received under AS 46.03.500(b) is not fit for use if sampling and testing of the property under AS 46.03.520 shows the presence of substances for which the department has set a limit under (b) of this section.

(b) The Department of Public Safety shall annually submit a list of substances to the Department of Environmental Conservation. The department shall adopt regulations that set the limit for each substance specified by the Department of Public Safety for purposes of determining whether the property for which a notice was received under AS 46.03.500 is fit for use. The department may also determine whether there are other substances associated with illegal drug manufacturing sites that may pose a substantial risk of harm to persons who occupy or use the site or to public health and may adopt regulations that set limits for those substances for the purposes of determining whether the property for which notice was received under AS 46.03.500 is fit for use.

###### Sec. 46.03.540.   Decontamination requirements.

(a) If the owner desires to decontaminate the property for which a notice has been issued under AS 46.03.500, the owner shall follow the guidelines established by the department under (b) of this section.

###### Sec. 46.03.550.   Fitness for use.

(a) Property for which a notice has been issued under AS 46.03.500 shall be determined by the department to be fit for use if the owner certifies to the department under penalty of unsworn falsification in the second degree that

(1) based on sampling and testing procedures established by the department under AS 46.03.520(b) and performed by laboratories that are on the list maintained by the department under AS 46.03.520(c), the limits on substances specified in regulations adopted under AS 46.03.530 are not exceeded on the property;

(2) if the property was ever sampled and tested under AS 46.03.520 and the test results showed the property to be unfit for use under AS 46.03.530, decontamination procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines established under AS 46.03.540(b) and the requirements of (1) of this subsection have been met; or

(3) a court has held that the determination that the property was an illegal drug manufacturing site was not made in compliance with AS 46.03.500(a).

(b) The department shall maintain a list of properties for which the department has received notice under AS 46.03.500(c). When the department determines under (a) of this section that a property on the list is fit for use, the department shall note on the list maintained on its Internet website under AS 46.03.500(f), and on any other list or database it maintains related to illegal drug manufacturing sites, that the property is fit for use and shall notify the owner of the property that the property is fit for use. The property shall remain on the lists or databases for five years after it is determined that the property is fit for use and shall be removed from the lists or databases within three months after the five-year period has elapsed. On request, the department shall give a copy of the list maintained under this section to any person who requests the list.

###### Sec. 46.03.560.   Securing the property.

The owner of property for which a notice was received under AS 46.03.500(b) shall ensure that the property is vacated and secured against use

(a) A person in charge of a facility, operation, or vessel, as soon as the person has knowledge of any discharge from the facility, operation, or vessel in violation of AS 46.03.740 or 46.03.750, shall immediately notify the department of the discharge.

(b) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, the department may enter into a written agreement with a person for the periodic reporting of minor discharges other than into the waters of the state.

###### Sec. 46.03.758.   Civil penalties for discharges of oil.

(a) The legislature finds that

(1) recent information discloses that the discharge of oil may cause significant short and long-term damage to the state's environment; even minute quantities of oil released to the environment may cause high mortalities among larval and juvenile forms of important commercial species, may affect salmon migration patterns, and may otherwise degrade and diminish the renewable resources of the state;

(2) the exact nature and extent of oil pollution can be neither documented with certainty nor precisely quantified on a spill-by-spill basis; however, in light of the magnitude of harm which may be caused by oil discharges, and the vital importance of commercial, sport, and subsistence fishing, tourism, and the state's natural abundance and beauty to the economic future of the state and its quality of life, it is the judgment of the legislature that substantial civil penalties should be imposed for the discharge of oil in order to provide a meaningful incentive for the safe handling of oil and to insure that the public does not bear substantial losses from oil pollution for which, because of its subtle, long-term, or unquantifiable nature, compensation would not otherwise be received; and

(3) the handling of oil in large quantities is a hazardous undertaking that poses a significant threat to the economy and environment of the state, which can be substantially reduced only by the taking of rigorous safety precautions involving considerable expense; conversely, persons handling oil in smaller amounts pose a correspondingly lower risk to the economy and environment of the state, and are capable of safe oil handling practices at correspondingly lower costs; in order to provide an incentive that is effective, but not punitive, it is necessary and appropriate that the assessment of civil penalties for discharges of small quantities of oil be left for case-by-case judicial determination, while ensuring, through the penalty provisions of this section, that the handling of oil in large quantities occurs in a manner that will not impair the renewable resources of the state.

(b) No later than the 10th day after the convening of the Second Session of the Tenth Alaska Legislature, the department shall submit to the legislature regulations establishing the following schedule of fixed penalties for discharges of oil:

(1) subject to (2) of this subsection, the penalties for the following categories of receiving environments may not exceed

(A) $10 per gallon of oil which enters an anadromous stream or other freshwater environment with significant aquatic resources;

(B) $2.50 per gallon of oil which enters an estuarine, intertidal or confined saltwater environment; and

(C) $1 per gallon of oil which enters an unconfined saltwater environment, public land or freshwater environment without significant aquatic resources;

(2) for discharges of oil that are caused by the gross negligence or intentional act of the discharger, or when the court finds that the discharger did not take reasonable measures to contain and clean up the discharged oil, the penalty shall be determined by multiplying the penalty established under (1) of this subsection by a factor of five.

(c) Regulations adopted under (b) of this section shall become effective 60 days after submission to the legislature, unless disapproved by a special concurrent resolution introduced in either house, and concurred in by a majority of the members in joint session within 60 days of the submission of the regulations.  The department may periodically revise regulations adopted under (b) of this section.  Revised regulations shall be submitted to the legislature no later than 10 days after the convening of the appropriate regular session of the legislature, and are subject to disapproval as specified in this subsection.

(d) The schedule shall vary according to the toxicity, degradability and dispersal characteristics of the oil.  The schedule shall also vary according to the sensitivity and productivity of the receiving environment.  Variations under this subsection may be by subcategories of receiving environments, specific receiving environments, or both.  The maximum penalties established in (b) of this section shall apply to discharges in the most sensitive and productive of receiving environments within each category of receiving environment, and the penalty shall decrease for less productive or sensitive receiving environments.

(e) If a discharge of oil in excess of 18,000 gallons not permitted under applicable state and federal law occurs within the territorial jurisdiction of the state, or into or upon the adjacent outer continental shelf of the state, the following persons, in addition to the person causing or permitting the discharge, are jointly and severally liable to the state, in a civil action, for the full amount of penalties established in the regulations adopted under this section:

(1) if the discharge occurs from any commercial or industrial facility other than a vessel or offshore platform, the owner, lessee or permittee, and operator of the facility;

(2) if the discharge occurs from a vessel,

(A) the owner and operator of the vessel; and

(B) the owner of the oil carried as cargo on the vessel at the time the vessel was loaded, if the loading occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the state, or at a deep-water port or other offshore storage facility adjacent to the state; however, if the owner of the oil temporarily transfers ownership of the oil to another person, and the transfer has the purpose or effect of evading the vicarious liability imposed by this section, the transferor shall be considered the owner of the oil for the purposes of this subsection; and

(3) if the discharge occurs from an offshore platform, the lessee or permittee of the tract or acreage upon which the platform is situated, and the operator of the platform.

(f) The court shall deduct from the penalties for which the person charged is liable under (e) of this section that amount of oil which was removed from the environment as a result of a cleanup operation undertaken in conformity with applicable state and federal law, unless the oil was removed by an agency of state, local or federal government.  The dispersal of oil through the use of chemical agents or other means is not considered removal for the purposes of this subsection.  The court may estimate the amount of oil removed.

(g) Except as provided in (f) and (j) of this section, the entire penalty specified in the regulations shall be imposed, except that a person who discharges oil into a receiving environment may demonstrate, by a preponderance of evidence, that mitigating circumstances relating to the effects of the discharge would make imposition of the full penalty inappropriate.  In determining whether mitigating circumstances exist, the court shall recognize that scientific knowledge pertaining to oil spills is very limited and if there is insufficient knowledge either to predict a base case or to show mitigating circumstances varying from that base case, the administratively established schedule of penalties shall apply.  If mitigating circumstances are proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the court may reduce or totally eliminate the penalty, in accordance with the purposes of this section.

(h) A person otherwise liable for penalties under (e) of this section is not liable if the person demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the discharge occurred solely as a result of

(1) an act of God;

(2) an act of a third person with intent to cause a discharge, unless the third person is a person with whom the person charged is made jointly and severally liable under (e)(1)§(3) of this section;

(3) a negligent or intentional act of this state or the United States; or

(4) an act of war.

(i) Notwithstanding AS 46.03.875, a person liable under this section is not also liable for the discharge of oil under AS 46.03.760(a).  A person causing or permitting a discharge of oil of 18,000 gallons or less not permitted under applicable state or federal law is liable for that discharge under the penalty provisions of AS 46.03.760(a); however, the court may impose a penalty of less than $500 for the discharge.

(j) The court may reduce the penalty imposed under this section if the person charged demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the discharge was caused solely by a negligent act of a third person, unless the third person is a person with whom the person charged is made jointly and severally liable under (e)(1)§(3) of this section.

(k)  [Repealed,§19 ch 59 SLA 1986.]

(l) In this section,

(4) "intertidal" means the ocean area between highest high water and lowest low water of tidal action;

(5) "offshore platform" means an offshore structure, whether floating or temporarily or permanently secured to the floor of the ocean or other water body, which is used primarily for the exploration for or production of oil or natural gas;

(6) "oil" means petroleum and any substance refined from petroleum, except crude oil;

(7) "operator" means the person who, through contract, lease, sublease, or otherwise, exerts general supervision and control of activities at the facility; the term includes, by way of example and not limitation, a prime or general contractor, the master of a vessel and the master's employer, or any other person who, personally or through an agent or contractor, undertakes the general functioning of the facility;

(8) "vessel" means any form or manner of watercraft, whether or not capable of self-propulsion, except offshore platforms.

###### Sec. 46.03.759.   Civil penalties for discharges of crude oil.

(a) A person who is found to be liable under any other state law for an unpermitted discharge of crude oil in excess of 18,000 gallons is, in addition to liability for any other penalties or for damages or the cost of containment and cleanup, liable to the state in a civil action for a civil penalty, up to a maximum of $500,000,000, in the amount of

(1) $8 per gallon of crude oil discharged for the first 420,000 gallons discharged; and

(2) $12.50 per gallon of crude oil discharged for amounts discharged in excess of 420,000 gallons.

(b) In determining how many gallons of crude oil have been discharged for purposes of assessing a penalty under (a) of this section, the court shall deduct the number of discharged gallons of crude oil that the defendant proves were removed by the defendant from the environment within the first 36 hours after the discharge as a result of a cleanup operation undertaken in conformity with applicable state and federal law. The dispersal of oil through burning, the use of chemical agents, biological additives, or sinking agents, or other means is not considered removal for the purposes of this subsection.

(c) Subject to the $500,000,000 maximum set under (a) of this section the court shall assess four times the penalty set out in (a) of this section if the court finds

(1) the discharge was caused by the gross negligence or intentional act of the defendant;

(2) the defendant did not take reasonable measures to contain and clean up the discharged oil; or

(3) the defendant did not act or respond in accordance with an approved oil discharge prevention and contingency plan.

(d) Notwithstanding AS 46.03.875, a person liable for civil penalties under this section is not also liable for the discharge of the crude oil under AS 46.03.760(a). A person causing or permitting a discharge of crude oil of 18,000 gallons or less not permitted under applicable state or federal law is liable for that discharge under the penalty provisions of AS 46.03.760(a); however, the court may impose a penalty of less than $500 for the discharge.

(e) The court may reduce the penalty imposed under this section if the defendant demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the discharge was caused solely by a negligent act of a third person unless the third person is a person with whom the defendant was found jointly and severally liable for the discharge under other state law.

(f) A person otherwise liable for penalties under this section is not liable if the person demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the discharge occurred solely as a result of

(1) an act of God;

(2) a negligent or intentional act of the state or the United States; or

(3) an act of war.

(g) In this section, "discharge" means entry of crude oil into or upon the water or public land of the state, regardless of causation, except discharges into an enclosed and impervious oil spill containment area.

###### Sec. 46.03.760.   Civil action for pollution; damages.

(a) A person who violates or causes or permits to be violated a provision of this chapter other than AS 46.03.250§46.03.313, or a provision of AS 46.04 or AS 46.09, or a regulation, a lawful order of the department, or a permit, approval, or acceptance, or term or condition of a permit, approval, or acceptance issued under this chapter or AS 46.04 or AS 46.09 is liable, in a civil action, to the state for a sum to be assessed by the court of not less than $500 nor more than $100,000 for the initial violation, nor more than $5,000 for each day after that on which the violation continues, and that shall reflect, when applicable,

(1) reasonable compensation in the nature of liquidated damages for any adverse environmental effects caused by the violation, which shall be determined by the court according to the toxicity, degradability, and dispersal characteristics of the substance discharged, the sensitivity of the receiving environment, and the degree to which the discharge degrades existing environmental quality;

(2) reasonable costs incurred by the state in detection, investigation, and attempted correction of the violation;

(3) the economic savings realized by the person in not complying with the requirement for which a violation is charged.

###### Sec. 46.03.761.   Administrative penalties.

(a) The department may assess an administrative penalty against an entity that violates or causes or permits to be violated a provision of AS 46.03.720(b) or a term or condition of a regulation, order, permit, approval, or certificate of the department issued or adopted under AS 46.03.720(b).

(b) Before assessing an administrative penalty under this section, the department shall

(1) communicate about the alleged noncompliance with the entity and the governing body of the community or municipality whose residents are served by the public water system; communication under this paragraph must be in language designed to be easily understood by the entity and governing body and must clearly describe the nature of the alleged noncompliance;

(2) offer technical assistance to aid in correcting the alleged noncompliance when the department has reason to believe that the entity may lack the resources or expertise to get technical assistance from other sources; and

(3) unless the alleged noncompliance poses an immediate threat to the public health, give the entity a reasonable amount of time to correct the alleged noncompliance after the department has complied with (1) and (2) of this subsection.

(c) If, after complying with (b) of this section, the department determines that noncompliance still exists and the violation is subject to a penalty under this section, the department may make a preliminary determination to assess the penalty. The department shall provide notice to the entity of its preliminary determination. The entity may, within 10 days after receiving the notice, request the department to reconsider its decision. If a timely request for reconsideration is made, the department shall reconsider its preliminary determination and may affirm or modify the determination. The department shall notify the entity of the decision. If a timely request for reconsideration is not received or if, after reconsideration, the department determines that a penalty should be assessed, the department may assess the penalty. The department shall provide notice of the assessment and instructions for contesting and appealing the assessment to the entity by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice must inform the entity of the amount of the proposed penalty and that the entity has 45 days within which to file a notice with the department contesting the proposed penalty. If, within 45 days after receiving the notification issued by the department, the entity fails to file a notice contesting the proposed penalty, the proposed penalty is considered a final order. The department may extend the time periods specified in this subsection for good cause.

(d) If an entity sends notice to the department contesting a proposed penalty under (c) of this section, the department shall afford an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with its adjudicatory hearing procedures. After an opportunity for a hearing, the department shall issue an order, based upon findings of fact, affirming, modifying, or rescinding the administrative penalty. The order must include notice that the entity may appeal the order to the superior court and the address of the appropriate superior court. The order is the final agency action on the penalty.

(e) An entity against whom an administrative penalty is assessed under this section may obtain judicial review of the administrative penalty by filing a notice of appeal in the superior court as provided by the Alaska Rules of Appellate Procedure. An order of the department under (d) of this section becomes final and is not subject to review by a court if a notice of appeal is not filed with the superior court within the period provided for by the Alaska Rules of Appellate Procedure.

(f) Unless the notice of appeal is incomplete or otherwise not in conformance with court rules, a notice of appeal under (e) of this section is considered to be filed with the superior court on the day the entity delivers the appropriate documents and fee to the appropriate superior court. Determining whether the notice of appeal is complete and otherwise in conformance with court rules is the responsibility of the superior court.

(g) An administrative penalty assessed under this section may not exceed (1) $1,000 a day for each violation if the affected public water supply system serves a population of more than 10,000 persons; (2) $250 a day for each violation if the affected public water supply system serves a population of 10,000 or fewer persons but more than 1,000 persons; and (3) $100 a day for each violation if the public water supply system serves 1,000 or fewer persons. Each provision, term, or condition violated is a separate and distinct violation. If a violation of a provision, term, or condition continues from day to day, each day is a separate violation.

(h) In determining the amount of a penalty assessed under this section, the department shall consider

(1) the effect of the violation on the public health or the environment;

(2) reasonable costs incurred by the state in the detection, investigation, and attempted correction of the violation;

(3) the economic savings realized by the entity by not complying with the requirement for which a violation is charged;

(4) any previous history of compliance or noncompliance by the entity with this chapter, AS 46.04, AS 46.09, and AS 46.14;

(5) the need to deter future violations;

(6) the extent and seriousness of the violation, including the potential for the violation to threaten public health or the environment;

(7) whether the entity achieved compliance with the requirement violated within the shortest feasible time; and

(8) other factors considered relevant to the assessment that are adopted by the department in regulation.

(i) If an entity fails to pay an administrative penalty assessed under this section after the penalty becomes final, the department may bring an action to collect the penalty. The amount of the penalty is not subject to review by the court in such an action.

(j) In a collection action under (i) of this section, the court shall award the prevailing party full reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in the collection action.

(k) Action under this section by the department does not limit or otherwise affect the authority of the department to otherwise enforce this chapter, AS 46.04, AS 46.08, AS 46.09, AS 46.14, or regulations adopted under those statutes, or to recover damages, restoration expenses, investigation costs, court costs, attorney fees, or other necessary expenses. The court shall set off against a judicial civil assessment subsequently awarded under AS 46.03.760 an amount ordered to be paid under this section by the same entity for the same violation.

(l) In this section, "entity" means the owner or operator of a public water system.

###### Sec. 46.03.763.   Attorney fees and costs.

In an action to impose civil penalties under AS 46.03.758, 46.03.759, or 46.03.760 for a discharge of oil, the state may recover full reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred by the state in maintaining the action.

###### Sec. 46.03.765.   Injunctions.

The superior court has jurisdiction to enjoin a violation of this chapter, AS 46.04, AS 46.09, AS 46.14, or of a regulation, a lawful order of the department, or permit, approval, or acceptance, or term or condition of a permit, approval, or acceptance issued under this chapter, AS 46.04, AS 46.09, or AS 46.14. In actions brought under this section, temporary or preliminary relief may be obtained upon a showing of an imminent threat of continued violation, and probable success on the merits, without the necessity of demonstrating physical irreparable harm. The balance of equities in actions under this section may affect the timing of compliance, but not the necessity of compliance within a reasonable period of time.

###### Sec. 46.03.770.   Detention of vessel without warrant as security for damages.

A vessel that is used in or in aid of a violation of AS 46.03.740§46.03.750 may be detained after a valid search by the department, an agent of the department, a peace officer of the state, or an authorized protection officer of the Department of Fish and Game. Upon judgment of the court having jurisdiction that the vessel was used in, or was the cause of, a violation of AS 46.03.740§46.03.750 with knowledge of its owner or under circumstances indicating that the owner should reasonably have had this knowledge, the vessel may be held as security for payment to the state of the amount of damages assessed by the court under AS 46.03.758, 46.03.759, 46.03.760, 46.03.822, and AS 46.04.030(g). If the damages assessed are not paid within 30 days after judgment or final determination of an appeal, the vessel shall be sold at public auction, or as otherwise directed by the court, and the damages paid from the proceeds. The balance, if any, shall be paid by the court to the owner of the vessel. The court shall permit the release of the vessel upon posting of a bond set by the court in an amount not to exceed the maximum amount of damages available under AS 46.03.758, 46.03.759, 46.03.760, 46.03.822, and AS 46.04.030(g). The damages received under this section shall be transmitted to the proper state officer for deposit in the general fund. A vessel seized under this section shall be returned or the bond exonerated if no damages are assessed under AS 46.03.758, 46.03.759, 46.03.760, 46.03.822, or AS 46.04.030(g).

(5) any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances, other than refined oil, for transport to disposal or treatment facilities, vessels or sites selected by the person, from which there is a release, or a threatened release that causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance.

(b) In an action to recover damages or costs, a person otherwise liable under this section is relieved from liability under this section if the person proves

(1) that the release or threatened release of the hazardous substance to which the damages relate occurred solely as a result of

(A) an act of war;

(B) except as provided under AS 46.03.823(c) and 46.03.825(d), an intentional or negligent act or omission of a third party, other than a party or its agents in privity of contract with, or employed by, the person, and that the person

(i) exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance; and

(ii) took reasonable precautions against the act or omission of the third party and against the consequences of the act or omission; or

(C) an act of God; and

(2) in relation to (1)(B) or (C) of this subsection, that the person, within a reasonable period of time after the act occurred,

(A) discovered the release or threatened release of the hazardous substance; and

(B) began operations to contain and clean up the hazardous substance.

(c) For purposes of (b)(1)(B) of this section, a third party or an agent of a third party is in privity of contract with the person who is otherwise liable, if the third party or its agent and the person are parties to a land contract, deed, or other instrument transferring title or possession of the real property on which the facility in question is located, unless that property was acquired by the person after the disposal or placement of the hazardous substance on, in, or at the facility, and the person establishes that the person has satisfied the requirements of (b)(1)(B) of this section and establishes that

(1) at the time the person acquired the facility the person did not know and had no reason to know that a hazardous substance that is the subject of the release or threatened release was disposed of on, in, or at the facility;

(2) the person is a governmental entity that acquired the facility by escheat, or through another involuntary transfer or acquisition, or through the exercise of eminent domain authority by purchase or condemnation;

(4) the person acquired the facility by inheritance or bequest; or

(5) the person is a state governmental entity and the state acquired the facility under Public Law 85-508 (Alaska Statehood Act).

(d) To establish that a person had no reason to know that the hazardous substance was disposed of on, in, or at the facility, as provided in (c)(1) and (l) of this section, the person must have undertaken, at the time of voluntary acquisition, all reasonable inquiries into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice in an effort to minimize liability. For purposes of this subsection a court shall take into account all relevant facts, including

(1) any specialized knowledge or experience the person has;

(2) the relationship of the purchase price to the value of the property if it were uncontaminated;

(3) commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property;

(4) the obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property; and

(5) the ability to detect contamination by appropriate inspection.

(e) This section does not diminish the liability of a person who previously owned or operated a facility or vessel and who would otherwise be liable. If the person obtained actual knowledge of the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at the facility or vessel and subsequently transferred ownership to another without disclosing that knowledge, the person is liable under (a)(2) of this section, and a defense under (b)(1)(B) of this section is not available to the person.

(f) This section does not diminish the liability of a person who, by an act or omission, caused or contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance that is the subject of the action relating to the facility or vessel.

(g) An indemnification, hold harmless, or similar agreement, or conveyance of any nature is not effective to transfer liability under this section from the owner or operator of a facility or vessel or from a person who might be liable for a release or substantial threat of a release under this section. This subsection does not bar an agreement to insure, hold harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for liability under this section. This subsection does not bar a cause of action that an owner, operator, or other person subject to liability under this section, or a guarantor, has or would have, by reason of subrogation or otherwise against another person.

(h) The state, a municipality, a village, a person who acts as a volunteer and is engaged in a response action under the direction of the federal or state on-scene coordinator, and a vessel of opportunity engaged in a response action under the direction of the federal or state on-scene coordinator are not liable under this section for costs or damages as a result of actions taken in response to an emergency created by a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance generated by or from a facility or vessel owned by another person unless the actions taken by the state, the municipality, the village, the volunteer, or the vessel constitute gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

(i) In an action to recover damages and costs, a person otherwise jointly and severally liable under this section is relieved of joint liability and is liable severally for damages and costs attributable to that person if the person proves that

(1) the harm caused by the release or threatened release is divisible; and

(2) there is a reasonable basis for apportionment of costs and damages to that person.

(j) A person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable under (a) of this section during or after a civil action under (a) of this section or after the issuance of a potential liability determination by the department. Actions under this subsection shall be brought under the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure and are governed by state law. In resolving claims for contribution under this section, the court may allocate damages and costs among liable parties using equitable factors determined to be appropriate by the court. This subsection does not diminish the right of a person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under (a) of this section.

(k) A unit of state or local government that acquired ownership or control of a vessel or facility through bankruptcy, foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, tax delinquency proceeding, abandonment, escheat, the exercise of eminent domain authority by purchase or condemnation, or circumstances in which the governmental unit involuntarily acquired title by virtue of its function as a sovereign is not liable as an owner or operator under this section unless the governmental unit has caused or contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at or from the facility or vessel, in which case, the governmental unit is subject to liability under this section in the same manner and to the same extent, both procedurally and substantively, as any nongovernmental entity.

#### Article 1. Oil Pollution Control.

## Chapter 04. Oil and Hazardous Substance Pollution Control.

###### Sec. 46.04.010.   Reimbursement for cleanup expenses.

The department shall promptly seek reimbursement under AS 46.03.760(d), AS 46.08.070, or from an applicable federal fund, for the expenses it incurs in cleaning up or containing a discharge of oil. If the department obtains reimbursement for a portion of its expenses from a federal fund, the remainder of the expenses incurred may be recovered under AS 46.03.760(d) or AS 46.08.070. Money received by the department under this section shall be deposited in the general fund and credited to

(1) the oil and hazardous substance release response mitigation account established under AS 46.08.025(b); the amount required to be deposited under this paragraph shall represent the proportion of the expenses recovered that were originally paid for from the oil and hazardous substance release account established under AS 46.08.010(a)(2); or

(2) the oil and hazardous substance release prevention mitigation account established under AS 46.08.020(b); the amount required to be deposited under this paragraph is the amount of money recovered that exceeds the amount payable to the response mitigation account under (1) of this section.

###### Sec. 46.04.020.   Removal of oil discharges.

(a) A person causing or permitting the discharge of oil shall immediately contain and clean up the discharge.  The department may waive this requirement

(1) if it determines, in consultation with the United States Coast Guard or the United States Environmental Protection Agency, as appropriate, that containment or cleanup is technically not feasible; or

(2) if the cleanup or containment activities would result in greater environmental damage than the discharge itself.

(b) The containment and cleanup of discharged oil shall be carried out in a manner approved by the department.  Wastes generated as a result of containment or cleanup activities shall be disposed of in a manner approved by the department.  The requirement of this subsection for approval of containment and cleanup activities does not apply to the United States Coast Guard or United States Environmental Protection Agency acting under the authority of§311(c) or (d) of the Clean Water Act.

(c) If the department determines that containment or cleanup activities are not adequate, it may direct the person engaged in the activities to cease and may undertake the activities itself through contract or its own resources, or both. The department may not direct the cessation of containment or cleanup activities undertaken by the United States Coast Guard or United States Environmental Protection Agency under§311 of the Clean Water Act.  However, the department may undertake, direct, or authorize supplemental cleanup or containment efforts.

(d) The department shall provide for the immediate containment or cleanup of an oil discharge of unexplained origin unless

(1) the department determines, in consultation with the United States Coast Guard or the United States Environmental Protection Agency that containment or cleanup of the oil discharge is technically not feasible; or

(2) the containment or cleanup activities would result in greater environmental damage than the discharge itself.

(e) The department shall enter into negotiations for memoranda of understanding or cooperative agreements with the United States Coast Guard, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and other persons in order to

(1) facilitate coordinated and effective oil discharge prevention and response in the state, including agreements relating to development and enforcement of vessel traffic control and monitoring systems for tank vessels and oil barges operating in or near the waters of the state;

(2) provide for cooperative review of oil discharge prevention and contingency plans submitted to the department under AS 46.04.030;

(3) provide for cooperative inspections of oil terminal facilities by the department and the United States Coast Guard or United States Environmental Protection Agency; and

(4) provide for cooperative oil discharge notification procedures.

(f) In fulfilling its responsibilities under (e) of this section, the department shall consult with the governing bodies of municipalities and villages.

(g) In addition to existing obligations under state and federal law, and the provisions of the state and federal Trans Alaska Pipeline System right-of-way agreements, the common operating agent for the holder and lessees of the right-of-way agreement for the trans Alaska pipeline shall (1) immediately contain and clean up a discharge or threatened discharge of oil transported by or due to the operation of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System or due to related activities, including activities related to a vessel en route to, berthed at, or transiting from the Trans Alaska Pipeline System marine terminal or traveling on waters within Prince William Sound; and (2) provide services required in a response action under contract terms as provided under AS 46.04.030(q). The obligations imposed under this subsection do not affect the response action duties of another person or the liability of another person for a discharge or threatened discharge. Upon the request of the person required to respond to a discharge or threatened discharge under this subsection, the obligation imposed by this subsection may be transferred to another person required by law to respond to the discharge or threatened discharge if the transfer is approved by the federal and state on-scene coordinators. In this subsection, "Prince William Sound" has the meaning given in AS 46.04.030(q).

(h) A charge, contract term, or financial responsibility requirement imposed by the holders and lessees of the right-of-way agreement for the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, the holders and lessees' common operating agent, or the agent or representative of either the holders and lessees, or their common operating agent, on or for a vessel traveling from a marine terminal and related to containing and cleaning up a discharge or threatened discharge of oil or the obligations imposed under (g) of this section

(1) must be fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory; and

(2) with respect to a financial responsibility requirement in excess of $10,000,000, must

(A) not exceed the potential cost of containment and cleanup as provided in the applicable contingency plan under AS 46.04.030 that the agent may reasonably be expected to incur from a discharge or threatened discharge of oil from that vessel before the transfer of cleanup and containment management and control to the responsible party; in establishing the financial responsibility requirement, the common operating agent shall assume that transfer of management and control will occur at the earliest practicable time following the discharge or threat of discharge; and

(B) vary among each vessel in proportion to the volume of oil carried by each vessel per voyage from a marine terminal; for purposes of this subparagraph, the volume of oil carried by the vessel must be reduced by the percentage of spill reduction credits granted that vessel under regulations adopted by the department.

(i) The superior court and, with respect to intrastate voyages, the Regulatory Commission of Alaska under AS 42.05.361§42.05.431, have concurrent jurisdiction to review and enjoin a charge, contract term, or financial responsibility requirement described under (h) of this section at the request of a vessel owner, operator, or charterer. Except as provided in this subsection, nothing in this section affects the jurisdiction of the Regulatory Commission of Alaska.

###### Sec. 46.04.025.   Confidential information.

The department may maintain the confidentiality of a manufacturer's proprietary technical information relating to chemical and biological agents used to control or mitigate the effects of an oil discharge. The department may refuse to release the information unless the manufacturer authorizes its release or unless a court orders its release.  The department may provide the information to the Department of Fish and Game and other state and federal agencies if the department or other agency requesting the information agrees to maintain its confidentiality.

###### Sec. 46.04.030.   Oil discharge prevention and contingency plans.

(a) A person may not cause or permit the operation of an oil terminal facility in the state unless an oil discharge prevention and contingency plan for the facility has been approved by the department and the person is in compliance with the plan.

(b) A person may not cause or permit the operation of a pipeline or an exploration or production facility in the state unless an oil discharge prevention and contingency plan for the pipeline or facility has been approved by the department and the person is in compliance with the plan.

(c) Except as provided in (n) of this section, a person may not operate a tank vessel or an oil barge within the waters of the state, or cause or permit the transfer of oil to or from a tank vessel or an oil barge, unless an oil discharge prevention and contingency plan for the tank vessel or oil barge has been approved by the department and the person is in compliance with the plan.

(d) Upon approval of a contingency plan, the department shall issue to the plan holder a certificate stating that the contingency plan has been approved by the department. The certificate must include the name of the facility, pipeline, tank vessel, or oil barge for which it is issued, the effective date of the contingency plan, and the date by which the contingency plan must be submitted for renewal. A contingency plan must be submitted for renewal every five years.

(e) The department may attach reasonable terms and conditions to its approval or modification of a contingency plan that the department determines are necessary to ensure that the applicant for a contingency plan has access to sufficient resources to protect environmentally sensitive areas and to contain, clean up, and mitigate potential oil discharges from the facility or vessel as provided in (k) of this section, and to ensure that the applicant complies with the contingency plan. If a contingency plan submitted to the department for approval relies on the services of an oil spill primary response action contractor, the department may not approve the contingency plan unless the primary response action contractor is registered and approved under AS 46.04.035. The contingency plan must provide for the use by the applicant of the best technology that was available at the time the contingency plan was submitted or renewed. The department shall identify the prevention and response technologies that are subject to a best available technology determination. The department may find that any technology meeting the response planning standards in (k) of this section or a prevention performance standard established under AS 46.04.070 is the best available technology. The department may prepare findings and maintain a list of those technologies that are considered the best available. The department may require an applicant or holder of an approved contingency plan to take steps necessary to demonstrate the applicant's or holder's ability to carry out the contingency plan, including

(1) periodic training;

(2) response team exercises; and

(3) verifying access to inventories of equipment, supplies, and personnel identified as available in the approved contingency plan.

(f) Upon request of a plan holder or on the department's own initiative, the department, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may modify its approval of a contingency plan if the department determines that a change has occurred in the operation of a facility or vessel necessitating an amended or supplemented plan, or the operator's discharge experience demonstrates a necessity for modification. The department, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may revoke its approval of a contingency plan if the department determines that

(1) approval was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation;

(2) the operator does not have access to the quality or quantity of resources identified in the plan;

(3) a term or condition of approval or modification has been violated; or

(4) the person is not in compliance with the contingency plan and the deficiency materially affects the plan holder's response capability.

(g) Failure of a holder of an approved or modified contingency plan to comply with the plan, or to have access to the quality or quantity of resources identified in the plan or to respond with those resources within the shortest possible time in the event of a spill is a violation of this chapter for purposes of AS 46.03.760(a), 46.03.765, 46.03.790, and any other applicable law. If the holder of an approved or modified contingency plan fails to respond to and conduct cleanup operations of an unpermitted discharge of crude oil with the quality and quantity of resources identified in the plan and in a manner required under the plan, the holder is strictly liable, jointly and severally, for the civil penalty assessed under AS 46.03.758, 46.03.759, or 46.03.760 against any other person for that discharge.

(h) The department is the only state agency that has the power to approve, modify, or revoke a contingency plan for the purposes of this section. The department shall exercise its power under this section in a timely manner. Except as provided in (i) of this section, it is not a defense to an action brought for a violation of (a)§(c) of this section that the person charged believed that a current contingency plan had been approved by the department.

(i) It is a defense to an action brought for a violation of (a)§(c) of this section that the person charged relied on a certificate of approval issued by the department under (d) of this section unless the person knew or had reason to know at the time of the alleged violation that approval of the plan had been revoked or that the holder of the plan was not capable of carrying out the plan.

(j) Before the department approves or modifies a contingency plan under this section, the department shall provide a copy of the contingency plan to the Department of Fish and Game and to the Department of Natural Resources for their review. The department shall by regulation establish the procedures and time limits applicable to agency review of contingency plans.

(k) Except as provided in (m) and (o) of this section, the holder of an approved contingency plan required under this section shall maintain, or have available under contract, in its region of operation or in another region of operation approved by the department, singly or in conjunction with other operators, sufficient oil discharge containment, storage, transfer, and cleanup equipment, personnel, and resources to meet the following response planning standards:

(1) for a discharge from an oil terminal facility, the plan holder shall plan to be able to contain or control, and clean up a discharge equal to the capacity of the largest oil storage tank at the facility within 72 hours, except that if the department determines that the facility is located in an area of high risk because of natural or man-made conditions outside of the facility, it may increase the volume requirement under this paragraph so that the contingency plan must be designed for a response that is greater in amount than the capacity of the largest oil storage tank at the facility;

(2) for a discharge from an exploration or production facility or a pipeline, the plan holder shall plan to be able to contain or control, and clean up the realistic maximum oil discharge within 72 hours;

(3) for a discharge of crude oil from a tank vessel or oil barge, the plan holder shall plan to be able to contain or control, and clean up a realistic maximum oil discharge as provided in (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph:

(A) for tank vessels and oil barges having a cargo volume of less than 500,000 barrels, the plan holder shall maintain at a minimum in the region of operation, equipment, personnel, and other resources sufficient to contain or control, and clean up a 50,000 barrel discharge within 72 hours;

(B) for tank vessels and oil barges having a cargo volume of 500,000 barrels or more, the plan holder shall maintain at a minimum in its region of operation, equipment, personnel, and other resources sufficient to contain or control, and clean up a 300,000 barrel discharge within 72 hours;

(C) in addition to the minimum equipment, personnel, and other resources required to be maintained within the region of operation by (A) or (B) of this paragraph, a plan holder shall maintain, either within or outside of the plan holder's region of operation, additional equipment, personnel, and other resources sufficient to contain or control, and clean up a realistic maximum discharge within the shortest possible time; the plan holder must demonstrate that the equipment, personnel, and other resources maintained outside the plan holder's region of operation are accessible to the plan holder and will be deployed and operating at the discharge site within 72 hours;

(4) for a discharge from a tank vessel or oil barge carrying noncrude oil in bulk as cargo, the plan holder shall plan to be able to contain or control 15 percent of the maximum capacity of the vessel or barge or the realistic maximum oil discharge, whichever is greater, within 48 hours and clean up the discharge within the shortest possible time consistent with minimizing damage to the environment;

(5) for a discharge subject to the provisions of (1)§(3) of this subsection that enters a receiving environment other than open water, the time requirement for clean up of the portion of the discharge that enters the receiving environment may, in the department's discretion, be within the shortest possible time consistent with minimizing damage to the environment.

(l) The provisions of (k) of this section do not constitute cleanup standards that must be met by the holder of a contingency plan. Notwithstanding (k) of this section, failure to remove a discharge within the time periods set out in (k) of this section does not constitute failure to comply with a contingency plan for purposes of (g) of this section or for the purpose of imposing administrative, civil, or criminal penalties under any other law.

(m) When considering whether to approve or modify a contingency plan, the department may consider evidence that oil discharge prevention measures such as double hulls or double bottoms on vessels or barges, secondary containment systems, hydrostatic testing, enhanced vessel traffic systems, or enhanced crew or staffing levels have been implemented, and, in its discretion, may make exceptions to the requirements of (k) of this section to reflect the reduced risk of oil discharges from the facility, pipeline, vessel, or barge for which the plan is submitted or being modified.

(n) A tank vessel or oil barge that is conducting, or is available only for conducting, oil discharge response operations is exempt from the requirements of (c) of this section if the tank vessel or oil barge has received prior approval of the department. The department may approve exemptions under this subsection upon application and presentation of information required by the department.

(o) A holder of an approved contingency plan does not violate the terms of the contingency plan by furnishing to another plan holder, with the approval of the department, equipment, materials, or personnel to assist the other plan holder in a response to an oil discharge. The plan holder shall replace or return the transferred equipment, materials, and personnel as soon as feasible. The department shall by regulation determine the maximum amount of equipment, materials, or personnel and the maximum amount of time for which it will approve a transfer.

(p)  [Repealed,§1 ch 16 SLA 1993.]

(q) Except as provided in (n) of this section and in order to receive approval from the department for an oil discharge prevention and contingency plan submitted under this section, the owner, operator, or charterer of a vessel that intends to carry oil that has been transported by the Trans Alaska Pipeline System shall obtain by contract the services required in a response action from the common operating agent for the holders and lessees of the right-of-way agreement for the Trans Alaska Pipeline System. The contract must contain the following provisions: (1) the common operating agent, as a primary response action contractor shall, unless services required in a response action are transferred as provided in (3) of this subsection, provide services required in a response action for a discharge or a threatened discharge of oil to the owner, operator, or charterer of the vessel while the vessel is berthed at, en route to, or transiting from the Trans Alaska Pipeline System marine terminal or traveling on waters within Prince William Sound; (2) that its coverage for any particular vessel may not be terminated by the common operating agent while that vessel is within Prince William Sound; this provision may not be interpreted to limit the department's authority to revoke approval under this section for an oil discharge prevention and contingency plan submitted by the owner, operator, or charterer of a vessel; and (3) the owner, operator, or charterer of the vessel shall accept a transfer of the services required in a response action to a discharge or threatened discharge, after receiving not less than 72 hours of advance notice and after the transfer has been approved by the federal and state on-scene coordinators. In addition to the requirements of this subsection, the department may require individual vessels to submit additional contingency plans to cover specific vessel response, prevention equipment, and procedures. Nothing in this subsection is intended to preclude the federal or state government from assuming management and control of an oil spill response to a discharge or threatened discharge from a vessel under appropriate circumstances. In this subsection, "Prince William Sound" means all marine waters within the boundary line established at Cape Puget, southeasterly to Cape Cleare, along Montague Island to Zaikof Point, easterly to Cape Hinchinbrook, along Hinchinbrook Island to Point Bintinck, and easterly to Point Whitshed.

(c) Except as provided in (m) of this section, a person may not operate a tank vessel or an oil barge within the waters of the state, or cause or permit the transfer of oil to or from a tank vessel or an oil barge, unless the person operating the tank vessel or oil barge has furnished to the department, and the department has approved, proof of financial ability to respond in damages. Proof of financial responsibility required under this subsection is

(1) $300, per incident, for each barrel of storage capacity or $100,000,000, whichever is greater, for a tank vessel or barge carrying crude oil;

(2) $100, per incident, for each barrel of storage capacity or $1,000,000, whichever is greater, subject to a maximum of $35,000,000, for a tank vessel or barge carrying noncrude oil.

(d) Except as provided in (k) of this section, it is not a defense to an action brought for violation of (a)§(c) of this section that the person charged believed in good faith that proof of financial ability to respond in damages had been furnished to, and approved by, the department.

(e) Financial responsibility may be demonstrated by (1) self-insurance, (2) insurance, (3) surety, (4) guarantee, (5) letter of credit approved by the department, or (6) other proof of financial responsibility approved by the department, including proof of financial responsibility provided by a group of insureds who have agreed to cover pollution risks of members of the group under terms the department may prescribe. An action brought under AS 46.03.758, 46.03.759, 46.03.760(a) or (d), 46.03.822, or AS 46.04.030(g) may be brought in a state court directly against the insurer, the group, or another person providing evidence of financial responsibility; however, the liability under this section of a third-party insurer is limited to the type of risk assumed and the amount of coverage specified in the proof of financial responsibility furnished to and approved by the department. The applicant, and an insurer, surety, guarantor, person furnishing an approved letter of credit, or other group or person providing proof of financial responsibility approved by the department shall appoint an agent for service of process in the state. For purposes of this subsection, an insurer, other than a group of insureds whose agreement has been approved by the department, must either be authorized by the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development to sell insurance in the state or be an unauthorized insurer listed by the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development as not disapproved for use in the state. In this subsection, "third-party insurer" means a third-party insurer, surety, guarantor, person furnishing a letter of credit, or other group or person providing proof of financial responsibility on behalf of an applicant under this section; "third-party insurer" does not include the applicant.

(m) A tank vessel or oil barge that is conducting, or is available only for conducting, oil discharge response operations is exempt from the requirements of (c) of this section if the tank vessel or oil barge has received prior approval of the department. The department may approve an exemption under this subsection upon application and presentation of information required by the department.

###### Sec. 46.04.045.   Adjustment of dollar amounts.

(a) The dollar amounts in AS 46.04.040 change, as provided in this section, according to and to the extent of changes in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers for the Anchorage metropolitan area compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor (the index). The index for January 1990 is the reference base index.

(b) The dollar amounts change on October 1 of each third year according to the percentage change between the index for January of that year and the most recent index used to determine whether to change the dollar amounts. After calculation of the new amounts, the resulting amounts shall be rounded to the nearest cent.

(c) If the index is revised, the percentage of change is calculated on the basis of the revised index. If a revision of the index changes the reference base index, a revised reference base index is determined by multiplying the reference base index applicable by the rebasing factor furnished by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the index is superseded, the index referred to in this section is the one represented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as reflecting most accurately changes in the purchasing power of the dollar for Alaskan consumers.

(d) The department shall adopt a regulation announcing

(1) on or before June 30 of each third year, the changes in dollar amounts required by (b) of this section; and

(2) promptly after the changes occur, changes in the index required by (c) of this section, including, if applicable, the numerical equivalent of the reference base index under a revised reference base index and the designation or title of any index superseding the index.

(e) The department shall also provide notification of a change in dollar amounts required under (b) of this section to the clerks of court in each judicial district of the state.

(5) an agreement by a person to subordinate a prior interest to an environmental covenant affects the priority of that person's interest but does not by itself impose any affirmative obligation on the person with respect to the environmental covenant;

(6) if the environmental covenant covers commonly owned property in a common interest community, the record may be signed by any person authorized by the governing board of the owners' association.

###### Sec. 46.04.305.   Contents of environmental covenant.

###### Sec. 46.04.310.   Validity of environmental covenant; effect on other instruments.

(a) An environmental covenant entered into in accordance with AS 46.04.300§46.04.390 runs with the land.

(b) An environmental covenant is valid and enforceable even if

###### Sec. 46.14.200.   Review of permit action.

A person who has a private, substantive, legally protected interest under state law that may be adversely affected by the permit action, the owner and operator, or, if a public comment process is required or solicited, a person who participated in the public comment process may request an adjudicatory hearing under the department's adjudicatory hearing procedures. After the issuance of an adjudicatory hearing decision, a party to the hearing may obtain judicial review of that decision as provided in the Alaska Rules of Appellate Procedure.

###### Sec. 46.14.210.   General operating permits.

After notice and opportunity for public comment and hearing, the department may, unless the permit is disapproved by the federal administrator, establish a general operating permit that would be applicable to more than one stationary source determined by the department to be similar in emissions unit structure. A general operating permit must contain provisions that meet the requirements of this chapter that are applicable to operating permits. A general operating permit issued to a particular person takes effect when the person's application is determined to be complete unless the department notifies the applicant that the general permit is not applicable to the person's stationary source.

###### Sec. 46.14.211.   General minor permits.

After notice and opportunity for public comment and hearing, the department may establish a general minor permit that would be applicable to more than one stationary source determined by the department to be similar in structure. If authorized by the department, a permit issued under this section may be valid for multiple locations in this state. A general minor permit must contain provisions that meet the requirements of this chapter that are applicable to a minor permit.

The department may not issue a permit under this section unless the permit contains conditions that will ensure compliance with this chapter at each authorized location, including compliance with ambient air quality standards and applicable increment or visibility requirements adopted under this chapter. A permit under this section must require the owner and operator to notify the department at least 10 days before a change in location of a stationary source permitted under this section.

###### Sec. 46.14.220.   Objection by federal administrator.

(a) An operating permit may not be issued under this chapter until the federal administrator approves the permit, or until 45 days after a copy of the final draft permit has been provided by the department to the federal administrator, whichever is earlier. If, during the 45-day period, the federal administrator files an objection with the department, the department shall notify the applicant of the objection. The department may not issue the permit until the objection is resolved or the permit is revised to meet the objection of the federal administrator. Upon request of an applicant, the department shall assist the applicant in an effort to resolve promptly an objection by the federal administrator.

(b) Within 60 days after the close of the 45-day period under (a) of this section and in accordance with procedures established in federal regulations adopted under 42 U.S.C. 7661d(b)(2) (Clean Air Act, sec. 505(b)(2)), a person may petition the federal administrator to file an objection to the permit.

###### Sec. 46.14.230.   Duration of operating permits.

(a) An operating permit under this chapter, including an operating permit that contains a compliance schedule, shall be issued for a fixed term of five years after the date of issue, except as provided for temporary operations under AS 46.14.215 or unless a shorter term is requested by the permit applicant.

The department shall take measures practicable and otherwise lawful to avoid termination, modification, or revocation and reissuance by the federal administrator of permits issued by the department under this chapter.

###### Sec. 46.14.240.   Permit administration fees.

(a) The owner or operator of a stationary source who is required to apply for a permit under AS 46.14.130 shall pay to the department all assessed permit administration fees established under (b) of this section except that the person named in a permit issued under AS 46.14.170 shall pay assessed permit administration fees incurred after the date the permit is issued.

(b) The department shall establish by regulation permit administration fees in accordance with AS 37.10.050§37.10.058.

(c)  [Repealed, "" 60(b), 65 ch 46 SLA 2003.]

(d) Costs incurred by the department and other state or local governmental agencies that are assessed against small business facilities that qualify for assistance under AS 46.14.300§46.14.310 shall be recovered from emission fees under AS 46.14.250(h)(2) for the following services:

(1) providing preapplication consultation, assistance, and completeness review of applications for a permit, an amendment, a permit modification, or a renewal of a permit;

(2) reviewing or assisting in the preparation of specific documents to support a permit for a stationary source; the documents described in this paragraph include on-site evaluations.

###### Sec. 46.14.250.   Emission fees.

(a) A person named as permittee in a permit issued under this chapter shall pay to the department all assessed emission fees established under this section.

(b) The department shall establish by regulation an emission fee rate. The rate shall be set on the basis of dollars per ton of air pollutant emitted. The department shall assess emission fees annually on or before July 1 based on a stationary source's estimated assessable emissions for the subsequent fiscal year. The department may allow installment payments of assessed emission fees.

(c) For a stationary source that begins operation during a fiscal year, the department shall prorate the first year's fee to cover the time period occurring before the next annual payment date. The owner or operator shall pay the initial emission fee upon commencement of lawful stationary source operation unless authorized to pay by installments under (b) of this section. The first year's emission fee may not duplicate a fee paid by a permittee under AS 44.46.025 for the same emissions units for the same time period. If the fees would otherwise be duplicative, the department shall provide a credit toward the emission fee in the amount of the unused balance of the fee collected under AS 44.46.025. The unused balance to be credited shall be based on prorating the total original fee under AS 44.46.025 for the time period for which an emission fee applies.

(d) The department shall design the emission fee rate to distribute the total annual incurred costs described under (h) of this section in a manner so that each permittee is assessed an annual emission fee that reflects an equitable apportionment of the fees paid by each stationary source type, size, or category. In making an apportionment under (f)(6) of this section, the department shall consider factors such as exemptions or reduced rates for small amounts of emissions, limits upon assessable emissions, exempting small business facilities from the costs of the small business assistance program established under AS 46.14.300, air pollution prevention efforts, and other factors that may ensure fair distribution of the costs described under (h) of this section.

(e) [Repealed,§88 ch 56 SLA 2005.]

(f) The department shall set the emission fee rate in regulation to implement the policy established in (d) of this section. The department shall base the regulation on the findings of a report, which the department shall make available to the public with proper notice before adoption of the regulation, that examines

(1) fees assessed;

(2) alternative fee rates or formulas;

(3) types, sizes, or categories of stationary sources, their respective emission quantities, and their previous or proposed fee burden;

(4) apparent inequities encountered in the initial fee rate;

(5) total costs incurred or anticipated to be incurred under (h) of this section; and

(6) other factors that ensure fair distribution of the costs described in (h) of this section.

(g) The department shall periodically, and at least every four years, evaluate the fee rate set under this section to determine if it is responsive to the policy established in (d) of this section and shall provide its findings in a report.

(h) In this section,

(1) "assessable emission" means the quantity of each air pollutant for which emission fees are assessed and is the lesser of

(A) the stationary source's potential to emit, in tons per year, each air pollutant; or

(B) the projected annual rate of emissions, in tons per year, of each air pollutant by the stationary source based upon previous actual annual emissions if the permittee can demonstrate to the department its previous actual annual rate of emissions through monitoring, modeling, calculations, or other method acceptable to the department;

(2) "emission fees" mean fees assessed to recover costs incurred by the department and other state or local governmental agencies for the implementation of minor permits, for the implementation of construction permits, and for operating permits to the extent required under 42 U.S.C. 7661a(b)(3)(A) and federal regulations implementing that provision, for execution of the permit program established under this chapter that are generally not associated with service provided to a specific facility, including the costs incurred by the department or a local air quality program to comply with AS 46.14.010 and 46.14.015; the costs may include rent, utilities, permit program management, administrative and accounting services, and other costs as identified by the department in regulations; the fees shall also be sufficient to recover the cost of the small business assistance program under AS 46.14.300 and 46.14.310.

###### Sec. 46.14.255.   Interest and sanctions for nonpayment.

(a) The department may assess interest against the owner and operator after a fee is due under this chapter and is unpaid. Interest assessed under this subsection shall be computed at two percentage points higher than the prime rate, as defined in AS 44.88.599, for the day the fee was due.

(b) If a permittee has failed to pay a fee imposed under AS 46.14.240§46.14.250, a penalty, assessment, or damage award imposed under AS 46.03.760(e) or 46.03.790 for a violation of this chapter, or interest imposed under (a) of this section, the department may, after 30 days' written notice to the permittee, revoke a minor permit, refuse to issue or renew permits requested by the permittee, or refuse to amend or modify a permit when the amendment or modification is requested by the permittee.

###### Sec. 46.14.260.   Clean air protection fund.

(a) The clean air protection fund is established. The fund consists of fees collected by the department under AS 46.14.240 and 46.14.250 and under regulations authorized by AS 46.14.140, as required by 42 U.S.C. 7661a(b)(3)(C)(iii) (Clean Air Act, sec. 502(b)(3)(C)(iii)) for state participation in the federal emission control permit program.

(b) The money deposited into the clean air protection fund may only be used to cover the reasonable direct and indirect costs required to support the permit program under this chapter and the activities of the small business assistance program that are directed at stationary sources subject to this chapter, not including court costs or other costs associated with an enforcement action.

###### Sec. 46.14.265.   Emission control permit receipts account.

(a) The emission control permit receipts account is established in the state treasury. Under AS 37.05.146(c), money received by the department in payment of fees under AS 46.14.240 and 46.14.250 and under regulations adopted under AS 46.14.140, other than fees described in AS 46.14.260(a), shall be deposited in the account. Appropriations from the account are not made from the unrestricted general fund.

(b) Nothing in this section creates a dedicated fund.

###### Sec. 46.14.270.   Clean air protection account.

Civil or criminal penalties, fines, assessments, or damages, and interest, attorney fees, and costs collected as a result of a violation relating to this chapter and interest collected under AS 46.14.255 shall be deposited in the general fund and credited to a special account called the clean air protection account.

###### Sec. 46.14.275.   Timely and complete application as shield.

If an owner and operator have submitted a timely and complete application for a permit or a permit renewal, as applicable, but final action has not been taken on the application, the owner's and operator's failure to have an operating permit is not a violation of this chapter unless the delay in final action was due to the failure of the owner and operator to submit, in a timely manner, additional information required or requested to process the application. An owner and operator required to have an operating permit under this chapter are not in violation of the operating permit program established under this chapter before the date on which the owner and operator are required to submit an application under AS 46.14.150.

###### Sec. 46.14.280.   Termination, modification, reopening, or revocation and reissuance of permits by the department.

(a) After 30 days' written notice to the permittee, the department

(1) may terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue a construction, operating, or minor permit if the department finds that

(A) the permit was obtained by misrepresentation of material fact or by failure of the owner and operator to disclose fully the facts relating to issuance of the permit;

(B) the permittee has violated this chapter, a regulation, a judicial or administrative order, or a material term or condition of a permit, approval, or acceptance issued under this chapter; or

(C) the permittee has failed to construct or modify a stationary source within the time period specified in a construction permit, if any, required under AS 46.14.130(a);

(2) may modify, or revoke and reissue a construction, operating, or minor permit if the department finds that

(A) the permit contains a material mistake; or

(3) shall reopen a permit issued under this chapter

(A) based on a determination of the federal administrator or the department that the permit must be revised to comply with 42 U.S.C. 7401§7671q (Clean Air Act) and regulations adopted under 42 U.S.C. 7401§7671q; or

(B) to incorporate changes in law, or to impose equivalent emission limitations, that become applicable after the permit is issued if the permit is issued to a major source and has a remaining duration of three or more years; the department shall make revisions allowed under this subparagraph as soon as practicable, but, regarding a change in law, not later than 18 months after the change in law takes effect; the department may not reopen the permit of a major source under this subparagraph if the change in law is not effective until after the date that the permit expires.

(b) Reopening of a permit under (a)(3) of this section shall be treated as a permit renewal by the department if the procedural requirements for permit renewal have been met.

(c) Proceedings to reopen a permit under this section shall follow the same procedure as for initial permit issuance and shall affect only those parts of the permit for which the department had cause to reopen under this section.

###### Sec. 46.14.285.   Amendment and modification of permit upon request of permittee.

(a) A permittee may request

(1) a permit amendment that provides for administrative changes to a permit that do not result in material changes in permit terms or conditions, such as changes in the name of the owner or operator, mailing address, registered agent, or assessable emissions;

(2) an expedited authorization for minor changes in permit terms and conditions that provide for flexibility in the operation of a stationary source consistent with 42 U.S.C. 7661a(b)(10) (Clean Air Act, sec. 502(b)(10)), and regulations adopted under that paragraph; the department may adopt regulations that include procedures under which the public may participate when an expedited authorization is requested under this paragraph; or

(3) a modification of a permit to authorize significant changes in permit terms and conditions consistent with this chapter and regulations adopted under AS 46.14.140.

(b) The department shall review all requests submitted under (a) of this section and issue or deny the permit amendment or modification or otherwise authorize or deny the request consistent with this chapter and regulations adopted under this chapter.

###### Sec. 46.14.290.   Permit as shield.

(a) To the extent allowed under 42 U.S.C. 7661c(f) (Clean Air Act, sec. 504(f)), a permittee is considered in compliance with applicable requirements of this chapter, regulations adopted under this chapter and 42 U.S.C. 7401§7671q (Clean Air Act) and regulations adopted under it, if

(1) the applicable requirements are included and specifically identified in the owner or operator's permit; or

(2) the requirements are determined in writing not to be applicable to the permitted stationary source; a determination made under this paragraph shall be included in the permit.

(b) This section does not alter or affect

(1) the owner's and operator's obligation to comply with an emergency order issued under AS 46.03.820 or 42 U.S.C. 7603 (Clean Air Act, sec. 303);

(2) the liability of an owner and operator for a violation of applicable requirements of law before or at the time of permit issuance; or

#### Article 4. Local Programs.

###### Sec. 46.14.400.   Local air quality control programs.

(a) With the approval of the department, a municipality may establish and administer within its jurisdiction a local air quality control program that operates in lieu of and is consistent with all or part of the department's air quality program as established under this chapter. A first or second class borough may administer an air quality control program approved by the department under this subsection on an areawide basis and is not subject to the restrictions for acquiring additional areawide powers specified in AS 29.35.300§29.35.350. A third class borough may administer a local air quality control program approved by the department under this subsection only in a service area formed under AS 29.35.490(b) or (c).

(b) With the approval of the department, two or more municipalities or other entities may create a local air quality district for the purpose of jointly administering a local air quality control program within the boundaries of the air quality district.

(c) If the department finds that the location, character, or extent of particular concentrations of population, air pollutant emissions units, the geographic, topographic, or meteorological considerations, or a combination of these factors make impracticable the maintenance of appropriate levels of air quality without an areawide air pollution control program, the department may determine the boundaries within which a local air quality control program is necessary and direct that a local air quality control program spanning those boundaries is the only acceptable alternative to direct state administration.

(d) A municipality or a local air quality district seeking department approval for a local air quality control program shall enter into a cooperative agreement with the department that is designed to avoid unnecessary duplication of responsibilities. The cooperative agreement must include provisions specifying

(1) the respective duties and authority of the department and the municipality or local air quality district in the administration of the local air quality control program;

(2) the authority of the municipality or the local air quality district to employ staff to administer the local air quality control program;

(3) duties of staff employed under (2) of this subsection;

(4) the procedures that must be followed by the municipality or local air quality district when requesting money from the clean air protection fund to cover the costs of implementing the municipality's or district's air quality program;

(5) the procedures that will be used by the department in approving a request under (4) of this subsection and submitting it to the legislature for funding;

(6) respective enforcement responsibilities of the department and the municipality or the local air quality district;

(7) that if the municipality or local air quality control district seeks authority to take action under (f) of this section, the municipality or local air quality control district will use procedures that are substantially equivalent to those required under AS 46.14.010 and 46.14.015.

(e) A local air quality control program shall provide for the exemption of a locally registered motor vehicle from motor vehicle emission requirements adopted under AS 46.14.510 if the motor vehicle is not used within the program's jurisdiction.

(f) A municipality or a local air quality district administering a program under this section shall administer its local air quality control program according to this chapter, regulations adopted under those sections, and its cooperative agreement under (d) of this section. A municipality or local air quality district's program may, upon a finding by the local agency and an affirmative agreement by the department, establish a more stringent requirement than the stationary emissions unit permit program authorized under this chapter if public health or air quality effects provide a reasonable basis to regulate the emissions unit with the additional or more stringent requirement and the municipality or district has used procedures substantially equivalent to those required under AS 46.14.010 and 46.14.015 before establishing the more stringent requirement. This subsection does not prohibit a municipality or local air quality control district from establishing a mobile source emissions program more stringent than the state program without making findings of public health or air quality effects or using procedures substantially equivalent to those required under AS 46.14.010 and 46.14.015. In this subsection, "mobile source" does not include tank vessels or other watercraft.

(g) A determination, order, permit, or permit action issued under a local air quality control program is considered to be a determination, order, permit, or permit action of the department.

(h) Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law, the department may not delegate or enable another department or government entity to establish fee rates or collect fees under AS 46.14.240 or 46.14.250.

(i) If a municipality or a local air quality district administering a program under this section requires emissions inspection for a motor vehicle, emission inspection may not be required more than once every two years.

(j) A person who operates a motor vehicle in violation of emissions requirements imposed under this section is guilty of a violation and, upon conviction, shall be fined an amount not to exceed $500. It is the intent of the legislature that money collected under this subsection be appropriated to promote air quality control programs in municipalities.

###### Sec. 46.14.410.   Inadequacy of local program.

(a) If a municipality or a local air quality district has an approved local air quality control program and the department determines that the program is being implemented in a manner that fails to meet the terms of the cooperative agreement or is otherwise being inappropriately administered, the department shall give written notice setting out its determination to the municipality or local air quality district. Within 45 days after giving written notice, the department shall conduct a public hearing on the matter. The hearing shall be recorded by any means that ensures an accurate record.

(b) If, after the hearing, the department upholds the determination made in the written notice, the department shall provide the municipality or local air quality district with a written finding setting out the nature of the deficiencies and a description of the necessary action to be taken to ensure that the local air quality control program prevents or controls air pollution. The department shall provide its finding to the municipality or district within 45 days after closure of the public hearing record. The department shall set a reasonable period of time for the municipality or local air quality district to take corrective action in response to the department's finding.

(c) If the municipality or local air quality district fails to take corrective action within the time period set by the department under (b) of this section, the department shall terminate the cooperative agreement and resume management of air quality control in the affected jurisdiction. If the municipality or the local air quality district partially remedies, to the department's satisfaction, the deficiencies found in the determination, the department shall amend the cooperative agreement to reflect a modified allocation of responsibilities between the department and municipality or the local air quality district.

(d) A municipality or local air quality district that has had its cooperative agreement terminated may, with the department's approval, resume a local air quality control program if the municipality or district agrees to comply with AS 46.14.400 and with any corrective action plan required by the department.

(e) If the department finds that control of a particular class of stationary source or emissions unit, because of its complexity or magnitude, is beyond the reasonable capability of the municipality or the local air quality district or may be more efficiently and economically controlled at the state level, the department may assume and retain jurisdiction over the class of stationary source or emissions unit. Classifications under this subsection may be based on the nature of stationary sources or emissions units involved, their size relative to the size of the communities in which they are located, or another basis established by the department.

#### Article 5. Miscellaneous Provisions.

###### Sec. 46.14.500.   Air pollution from outer continental shelf activities.

(a) The department shall seek delegation of authority from the federal administrator to implement and enforce the terms and provisions of 42 U.S.C. 7627 (Clean Air Act, sec. 328) for the Pacific and Arctic Ocean areas offshore of the state. The department may adopt regulations that are necessary to acquire this delegated authority.

(b) In adopting regulations under this section, the department shall ensure that stationary sources located within 25 miles of the seaward boundary of the state are subject to the same air quality control requirements that would be applicable if the stationary source were located in the corresponding onshore area. For purposes of this subsection, stationary sources located within 25 miles of the seaward boundary of the state include a vessel servicing or associated with the stationary source while at the stationary source or en route to or from the stationary source and within 25 miles of the stationary source.

(c) In this section, "corresponding onshore area" means, with respect to a stationary source located within 25 miles of the seaward boundary of the state, the onshore attainment or nonattainment area that is closest to the stationary source, unless the commissioner determines that another area with more stringent requirements relating to control and abatement of air pollution may reasonably be expected to be affected by emissions from the offshore stationary source; this determination shall be based on the potential for air pollutants from the stationary source to reach the other onshore area and the potential of the air pollutants to affect the efforts of the other onshore area to attain or maintain a federal ambient air quality standard set under 42 U.S.C. 7470§7492 (Clean Air Act, secs. 160§169b) or a state equivalent.

###### Sec. 46.14.510.   Motor vehicle pollution.

(a) When the department determines that the state of knowledge and technology may allow or make appropriate the control of emissions from motor vehicles to further air quality control, the department may provide, by regulation, for the control of the emissions from motor vehicles. The regulations may prescribe requirements for the installation and use of equipment designed to reduce or eliminate emissions and for the proper maintenance of this equipment.

(b) Unless otherwise exempted by law, a person shall maintain in operating condition any element of the air pollution control system or mechanism of a motor vehicle that the department, by regulation, requires to be maintained in or on the motor vehicle.

(c) The department shall consult with the Department of Administration regarding implementation of the motor vehicle pollution control program. The Department of Administration shall cooperate with the department in implementing the program. As a part of a motor vehicle pollution control program, the department or a municipality that enforces a motor vehicle pollution control program may determine if a vehicle is properly registered as required by law.

(d) If the department adopts regulations requiring the maintenance of air pollution control systems or mechanisms in motor vehicles to control emissions from the vehicle, a motor vehicle subject to those regulations may not be issued a certificate of inspection unless the required air pollution control system or mechanism has been inspected in accordance with the standards, testing techniques, and instructions furnished by the department and the motor vehicle has been found to meet those standards. A valid certificate of inspection for the emission control system, if required by the department, must be presented to the Department of Administration before that department may register a motor vehicle.

(e) If the department adopts regulations requiring emissions inspection for a motor vehicle, the department may not require the vehicle be inspected more than once every two years.

(f) A person who fails to display an emissions inspection decal as required by law is guilty of a violation and, upon conviction, shall be fined an amount not to exceed $500. It is the intent of the legislature that money collected under this subsection be appropriated to control pollution from motor vehicle emissions.

(g) In addition to the emission control inspection program fee imposed under AS 28.10.423, the department or a municipality may impose a fee upon a vehicle required to be inspected under a motor vehicle emission control program established under this chapter, but the fee may not exceed the actual costs of the department or the municipality in administering

(1) the motor vehicle emission control inspection program; and

(2) the related ambient air monitoring program.

###### Sec. 46.14.515.   Inspection.

(a) An officer or employee of the department designated by the commissioner or an inspector authorized by the commissioner and certified under regulations adopted under AS 46.14.140(a)(14) may, upon presentation of credentials and at reasonable times with the consent of the owner or operator, enter upon or through any premises of a stationary source regulated under this chapter to

(1) inspect and copy any records required to be maintained;

(2) inspect any emissions unit, monitoring equipment, or method required to be used; or

(3) sample any emissions that the owner and operator of the stationary source is required to sample.

(b) During an inspection under this section, the inspector shall comply with applicable health and safety standards.

###### Sec. 46.14.520.   Confidentiality of trade secrets.

Records, reports, and information, and parts of records, reports, and information, other than emission data, in the department's possession or control are considered confidential records and shall be kept confidential and in separate files if the owner and operator have certified under oath to the department or authorized local program that

(1) public disclosure would tend to affect adversely the owner's and operator's competitive position; and

(2) the records, reports, or information, or parts of the records, reports, or information, would divulge production figures, sales figures, processes, production techniques, or financial data of the owner and operator that are entitled to protection as trade secrets under AS 45.50.910§45.50.945 (Alaska Uniform Trade Secrets Act).

###### Sec. 46.14.525.   Public records.

Except as provided in AS 46.14.520, permits, permit applications, emissions and monitoring reports, compliance reports, certifications, and monitoring, reporting, and quality assurance plans in the department's possession or control are available to the public for inspection and copying.

###### Sec. 46.14.530.   State and federal aid.

(a) A municipality or local air quality district with a local air quality control program may apply for, receive, administer, and spend state aid for the control of air emissions or the development and administration of the program if an application is first submitted to and approved by the department. Subject to available money appropriated by the legislature for the purpose of this section, the department may approve an application if it is consistent with the terms and conditions of the applicable cooperative agreement and meets the requirements of this chapter.

(b) A municipality or local air quality district with a local air quality control program may apply for, receive, administer, and spend federal aid for the control of air emissions or the development and administration of the program.

###### Sec. 46.14.535.   Grants. [Repealed,§4 ch 20 SLA 2009.]

###### Sec. 46.14.540.   Authority of department in cases of emergency.

(a) When the commissioner finds that an act of God, act of war, act of terrorism, or similar catastrophe necessitates emergency use of an unpermitted emissions unit or emergency use of a permitted emissions unit in a manner not authorized by the permit, the commissioner may waive procedural requirements of this chapter and issue an order to authorize emergency use of the emissions unit. When acting under this section, the commissioner shall impose conditions necessary to protect life, human health, welfare, property, and the environment and may impose other conditions the commissioner finds necessary and appropriate.

(b) An authorization issued under this section automatically terminates within a reasonable time after abatement of the emergency, subject to a maximum of 30 days from the date of issuance. However, the commissioner may reissue an authorization, if warranted, that may remain in effect for up to another 30 days. An authorization may be reissued more than once.

(c) A person acting under an order issued under (a) of this section is considered to be acting in compliance with the operating permit program established in this chapter.

(d) The commissioner may delegate the commissioner's authority under this section to deputy commissioners and division directors in the department.

###### Sec. 46.14.550.   Responsibilities of owner and operator; agent for service.

Notwithstanding use of the conjunctive or disjunctive in a provision of this chapter, before issuance of a permit under this chapter both the owner and operator of a stationary source are responsible for compliance with this chapter and regulations adopted under this chapter. If the owner and operator of the stationary source are separate persons, only one person is required to discharge a specific responsibility. After issuance of a permit under this chapter, only the permittee is responsible for permitted operations. The permittee shall have a designated agent for service of process in the state.

###### Sec. 46.14.560.   Unavoidable malfunctions and emergencies.

Excess emissions caused by an unavoidable emergency, a malfunction, or nonroutine repairs of an emissions unit including pollution control equipment or process equipment constitute an affirmative defense, when asserted under regulations adopted under AS 46.14.140, to an action brought for noncompliance with a technology-based emission standard. This section does not limit the department's power to enjoin the emission or require corrective action. This provision is in addition to any emergency or upset provision contained in an applicable requirement.

(c) If water to be sold by the state under (a) of this section, is to be removed from the hydrologic unit from which it was appropriated to another hydrologic unit, inside or outside the state, without being returned to the hydrologic unit from which it was appropriated, the commissioner may not sell the water unless the sale meets the requirements of (a)(2) of this section, a water conservation fee is assessed under AS 46.15.035, and, if the water to be sold is from a lake, river, or stream that is used by fish for spawning, incubation, rearing, or migration, or ground water that significantly influences the volume of water in a lake, river, or stream that is used by fish for spawning, incubation, rearing, or migration, the commissioner reserves a volume of water in the lake or an instream flow in the river or stream for the use of fish and to maintain habitat for fish. The commissioner may adjust the volume of water reserved under this subsection if the commissioner, after public notice and opportunity to comment and with the concurrence of the commissioner of fish and game, finds that the best interests of the state are served by the adjustment. A reservation under this subsection

(1) of a volume of water or an instream flow for the use of fish and to maintain habitat for fish that is reserved under this section is withdrawn from appropriation;

(2) for fish from a lake, river, or stream, identified under AS 16.05.870 or identified in a Department of Fish and Game regional guide as being used by fish for spawning, incubation, rearing, or migration on or before July 1, 1992, has a priority date as of July 1, 1992;

(3) is not subject to AS 46.15.145;

(4) of water does not apply to appropriations under this section of ground water of 5,000 gallons or less a day unless the commissioner, in consultation with the Department of Fish and Game, determines that the appropriation may adversely affect fish habitat in a lake, river, or stream; the commissioner shall consider multiple appropriations of water for a single related use as a single appropriation for the purposes of this subsection.

(d) With respect to rivers and streams described in (c) of this section, the instream flow reservation shall be limited to the portion of the stream, including tributaries to the stream, at and downstream of the point of diversion or withdrawal. With respect to lakes described in (c) of this section, the reservation shall be limited to the lake from which the diversion or withdrawal is made, and the outlet and tributaries to the outlet flowing downstream.

(e) The commissioner may not provide for the sale of salt water under this section.

(f) In this section,

(1) "fish" means a species of anadromous or freshwater fish that may be taken under regulations of the Board of Fisheries;

(2) "hydrologic unit" has the meaning given in AS 46.15.035(e).

###### Sec. 46.15.040.   Right to appropriate.

(a) A right to appropriate water can be acquired only as provided in this chapter.  A right to the use of water either appropriated or unappropriated may not be acquired by adverse use or possession.

(b) A right to appropriate water shall be obtained by first making application to the commissioner for a permit to appropriate. The commissioner shall by regulation prescribe the form and contents of the application and the procedure for filing the application.  If a permit is granted and the means of appropriation is constructed, a certificate of appropriation may be obtained.

(c) All applications to the commissioner for a permit to appropriate water, filed subsequent to July 1, 1966, shall be considered as having been simultaneously filed with the Department of Fish and Game under AS 16 and the Department of Environmental Conservation under AS 46.03.

(d) The commissioner's issuance of a permit under AS 46.15.080 or of a certificate under AS 46.15.065 or 46.15.120 does not represent a guarantee by the state to the permittee or certificate holder that water will be available for appropriation at a certain volume, quality, artesian pressure, or cost. This subsection does not, however, alter the right a permittee or certificate holder may have against a later appropriator, including a government agency.

###### Sec. 46.15.050.   Priority.

(a) Priority of appropriation gives prior right. Priority of appropriation does not include the right to prevent changes in the condition of water occurrence, such as the increase or decrease of stream flow, or the lowering of a water table, artesian pressure, or water level, by later appropriators, if the prior appropriator can reasonably acquire the appropriator's water under the changed conditions.

(b) Priority of appropriation made under this chapter dates from the filing of an application with the commissioner.

(c) Priority of appropriation perfected before July 1, 1966, shall be determined as provided in AS 46.15.065.

###### Sec. 46.15.060.   Existing rights.

A water right acquired by law before July 1, 1966 or a beneficial use of water on July 1, 1966, or made within five years before July 1, 1966, or made in conjunction with works under construction on July 1, 1966, under a lawful common law or customary appropriation or use, is a lawful appropriation under this chapter.  The appropriation is subject to applicable provisions of this chapter and regulations adopted under this chapter.

###### Sec. 46.15.065.   Determination of existing rights.

(a) A claimant of an existing right under AS 46.15.060 shall file a declaration of appropriation with the commissioner as set out in this section.  The declaration shall be considered correct until a certificate of appropriation is issued or denied. Priority of the right dates from the day work was begun on the appropriation if due diligence was used in completing the work; otherwise, from the day water was applied for the beneficial use.

(b) The commissioner shall, as soon as practicable, determine the rights of persons owning existing appropriations. To accomplish this, the commissioner shall

(1) by order set a definite period for filing a declaration of appropriation within a specified area or from a specified source;

(2) publish notice of the order once a week for three weeks before the beginning of the period in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected area;

(3) give notice of the order by certified mail to any appropriator within the specified area or from the specified source who has requested mailed notice or of whom the commissioner can readily obtain knowledge including each owner of a recorded mining claim.

(c) The commissioner shall make investigations as necessary of rights asserted by declarations filed under this section and shall determine each existing appropriation and mail a summary of the determination to each person who has filed a declaration with respect to the specified area or source. Any person adversely affected by a determination may file with the commissioner a request for a hearing within 20 days of the date the notice is mailed. If a hearing is requested, the commissioner shall, after consulting with the office of administrative hearings (AS 44.64.010), send a notice of the time and place of the hearing to each person who has filed a declaration.

(d) If a hearing is not requested with respect to a determination, or if, after the hearing, the commissioner finds the determination to have been correctly made, the commissioner shall immediately issue a certificate of appropriation.  If the commissioner finds the determination to be incorrect, the commissioner shall correct it and either issue a certificate of appropriation or refuse the certificate according to the commissioner's findings.

(e) A person aggrieved by the action of the commissioner may appeal to the superior court within 30 days of the date on which that action is final.

(f) The adjudication process for a declaration filed under (a) of this section that is pending before the commissioner on June 10, 1986, continues under the procedures set out in this section until the commissioner finally determines whether the declarant is entitled to a certificate. If a certificate is issued under this section, the certificate holder may be included as a participant in an adjudication under AS 46.15.165 or 46.15.166.

###### Sec. 46.15.070.   [Renumbered as AS 46.15.133.]

###### Sec. 46.15.080.   Criteria for issuance of permit.

(a) The commissioner shall issue a permit if the commissioner finds that

(1) rights of a prior appropriator will not be unduly affected;

(2) the proposed means of diversion or construction are adequate;

(3) the proposed use of water is beneficial; and

(4) the proposed appropriation is in the public interest.

(b) In determining the public interest, the commissioner shall consider

(1) the benefit to the applicant resulting from the proposed appropriation;

(2) the effect of the economic activity resulting from the proposed appropriation;

(3) the effect on fish and game resources and on public recreational opportunities;

(4) the effect on public health;

(5) the effect of loss of alternate uses of water that might be made within a reasonable time if not precluded or hindered by the proposed appropriation;

(6) harm to other persons resulting from the proposed appropriation;

(7) the intent and ability of the applicant to complete the appropriation; and

(8) the effect upon access to navigable or public water.

###### Sec. 46.15.090.   Preference in granting permits.

When there are competing applications for water from the same source, and the source is insufficient to supply all applicants, the commissioner shall give preference first to public water supply and then to the use that alone or in combination with other foreseeable uses will constitute the most beneficial use.

###### Sec. 46.15.100.   Terms of permit.

The commissioner may issue a permit for less than the amount of water requested, but in no case for more water than can be beneficially used for the purposes stated in the application. The commissioner may require modification of plans and specifications for the appropriation.  The commissioner may issue a permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations necessary to protect the rights of others, and the public interest. However, the permit shall be subject to termination only as provided in this chapter.

###### Sec. 46.15.110.   Time for construction and completion.

A permit may place a time limit for beginning construction and perfecting appropriation.  Reasonable extensions of time shall be permitted for good cause shown.

###### Sec. 46.15.120.   Certificates.

Upon completion of construction of the works and commencement of use of water, the permit holder shall notify the commissioner that the appropriator has perfected the appropriation.  If the commissioner determines that the appropriation has been perfected in substantial accordance with the permit, the commissioner shall issue the permit holder a certificate of appropriation.  The certificate shall set out any condition that the commissioner may prescribe by regulation, including conditions that are necessary to protect the prior rights of other persons and the public interest.

###### Sec. 46.15.130.   [Renumbered as AS 46.15.050.]

###### Sec. 46.15.133.   Notices; objections.

(a) If the commissioner proposes a sale of water or receives an application for appropriation or removal, the commissioner shall prepare a notice containing the location and extent of the proposed sale, appropriation, or removal, the name and address of the applicant, if applicable, and other information the commissioner considers pertinent. The notice shall state that within 15 days of publication or service of notice, persons may file with the director written objections, stating the name and address of the objector, and any facts tending to show that rights of the objector or the public interest would be adversely affected by the proposed sale, appropriation, or removal.

(b) The commissioner shall publish the notice in one issue of a newspaper of general distribution in the area of the state in which the water is to be appropriated, removed, or sold. The commissioner shall also have notice served personally or by certified mail upon an appropriator of water or applicant for or holder of a permit who, according to the records of the division of lands, may be affected by the proposed sale, appropriation, or removal and may serve notice upon any governmental agency, political subdivision, or person; notice shall also be served upon the Department of Fish and Game and the Department of Environmental Conservation. An applicant for an appropriation or removal shall pay the commissioner's costs in providing publication and notice under this subsection. The commissioner may require as a condition of a sale of water under AS 46.15.037, that a purchaser of water reimburse the department for the costs associated with providing notice of the proposed sale.

(c) Within 15 days of publication or service of notice, an interested person may file an objection. The commissioner may hold hearings upon giving due notice and shall grant, deny, or condition the proposed sale or application for appropriation or removal in whole or in part within 30 days of receipt of the last objection or, if the commissioner elects to hold hearings, within 180 days of receipt of the last objection. Notice of the order or decision shall be served personally or mailed to any person who has filed an objection.

(d) If no objection is filed, the commissioner may proceed to make a determination upon the application for appropriation or removal or the proposal for sale.

(e) A person aggrieved by the action of the commissioner or by the failure of the commissioner to grant, deny, or condition a proposed sale or an application for appropriation or removal in accordance with (c) of this section may appeal to the superior court.

(f) The commissioner may, by regulation, designate types of appropriations that are exempt from this section and provide simplified procedures for ruling on the applications. The commissioner may not exempt under this subsection appropriations for removal under AS 46.15.035, appropriations by the state for sale or sales by the state under AS 46.15.037, or removals of water under AS 46.15.035 and 46.15.037.

###### Sec. 46.15.135.   [Renumbered as AS 46.15.065.]

###### Sec. 46.15.140.   Abandonment, forfeiture, and reversion of appropriations.

(a) The commissioner may declare an appropriation to be wholly or partially abandoned and revoke or amend the certificate of appropriation as to the unused quantity of water if an appropriator, with intention to abandon, does not make beneficial use of all or a part of the appropriated water.

(b) The commissioner may declare that an appropriator has wholly or partially forfeited an appropriation, and shall revoke the certificate of appropriation in whole or in part if the appropriator voluntarily fails or neglects, without sufficient cause, to make use of all or a part of the appropriated water for a period of five successive years. A person who has a permit to develop a use of water including but not limited to residential, agricultural, industrial, or mining use, but has not developed that property to the point of water use before permit expiration, may file a request for permit extension with the commissioner.

(c) Failure to use beneficially for five successive years all or part of the water granted in a certificate of appropriation raises a rebuttable presumption that the appropriator has abandoned or forfeited the right to use the unused quantity of water and shifts to the appropriator the burden to prove otherwise to the satisfaction of the commissioner.

(d) If the commissioner revokes a certificate in whole or in part, the portion of the certificate covered by the revocation reverts to the state and the water becomes unappropriated water.

###### Sec. 46.15.145.   Reservation of water.

(a) The state, an agency or a political subdivision of the state, an agency of the United States, or a person may apply to the commissioner to reserve sufficient water to maintain a specified instream flow or level of water at a specified point on a stream or body of water, or in a specified part of a stream, throughout a year or for specified times, for

(1) protection of fish and wildlife habitat, migration, and propagation;

(2) recreation and park purposes;

(3) navigation and transportation purposes; and

(4) sanitary and water quality purposes.

(b) Upon receiving an application for a reservation under this section, the commissioner shall proceed in accordance with AS 46.15.133.

(c) The commissioner shall issue a certificate reserving the water applied for under this section if the commissioner finds that

(1) the rights of prior appropriators will not be affected by the reservation;

(2) the applicant has demonstrated that a need exists for the reservation;

(3) there is unappropriated water in the stream or body of water sufficient for the reservation; and

(4) the proposed reservation is in the public interest.

(d) After the issuance of a certificate reserving water, the water specified in the certificate shall be withdrawn from appropriation and the commissioner shall reject an application for a permit to appropriate the reserved water.

(e) A reservation under this section does not affect rights in existence on the date the certificate reserving water is issued.

(f) At least once each 10 years the commissioner shall review each reservation under this section to determine whether the purpose described in (a) of this section for which the certificate reserving water was issued and the findings described in (c) of this section still apply to the reservation.  If the commissioner determines that the purpose, or part or all of the findings, no longer apply to the reservation, the commissioner may revoke or modify the certificate reserving the water after notice, hearing when appropriate, and a written determination that the revocation or modification is in the best interests of the state.

###### Sec. 46.15.147.   [Renumbered as AS 46.15.175.]

###### Sec. 46.15.150.   Preferred use.

(a) An applicant who asserts and proves a preferred use shall be granted a permit and shall be granted preference over other appropriators.  A preferred use of water is for a public water supply.

(b) To be entitled to a preference an applicant must show that the applicant's use will be prevented or substantially interfered with by a prior appropriation; the use is a preferred use; the applicant agrees to compensate a permit or certificate holder for the prior appropriation for any damages sustained by the preferred use; and other information that the commissioner requires by regulation.

###### Sec. 46.15.155.   Authorization for temporary use of water.

(a) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this chapter, the commissioner may authorize the temporary use of a significant amount of water, as determined by the department by regulation, for a period of time not to exceed five consecutive years, if the water applied for has not been appropriated in accordance with this chapter.

(b) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this chapter, an authorization for a temporary use of less than a significant amount of water is not required under this section unless the commissioner has determined by regulation that the use may have an adverse effect on other water uses and that an authorization must be obtained from the department.

(c) The issuance of an authorization for temporary use of water under this section does not establish a right to appropriate water. The temporary use of water under an authorization remains subject to appropriation under this chapter.

(d) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this chapter, the commissioner is not required to provide public notice under AS 46.15.133 of a proposed authorization for temporary use of water; however, the commissioner shall request comment on an application for temporary use of water from the Department of Fish and Game and the Department of Environmental Conservation.

(e) The provisions of AS 46.15.080 do not apply to the issuance under this section of an authorization for temporary use of water.

(f) The commissioner may impose reasonable conditions or limitations on an authorization for temporary use of water to protect the water rights of other persons or to protect fish and wildlife habitat, human health, or other public interests.

(g) Upon approval by the department, an authorization under this section may be transferred to another person under the same conditions and limitations under which the authorization was issued.

(h) A person to whom an authorization for temporary use of water was issued under this section may allow another person to use the authorization, consistent with the conditions and limitations of the authorization.

(i) The commissioner may modify, suspend, or revoke an authorization issued under this section if the commissioner determines it necessary to protect the water rights of other persons or the public interest.

###### Sec. 46.15.160.   Transfer and change of appropriations.

(a) The right to use water under an appropriation or permit shall be appurtenant to the land or place where it has been or is to be beneficially used, provided, that water supplied by one person to another person's property is not appurtenant to the property unless the parties so intend.  An appurtenant water right shall pass with a conveyance of the land, or transfer, or by operation of law unless specifically exempted from the conveyance.

(b) With the permission of the commissioner, all or any part of an appropriation may be severed from the land to which it is appurtenant, may be sold, leased or transferred for other purposes or to other land and be made appurtenant to other land. A permit or certificate or a deed, lease, contract, assignment of permit or other instrument transferring an appropriation must be filed in the office of the commissioner and a certified copy of the instrument must be recorded in the recorder's office of the recording district in which the appropriation is located.

###### Sec. 46.15.165.   Administrative adjudications.

(a) The commissioner may, by order, initiate an administrative adjudication to quantify and determine the priority of all water rights and claims in a drainage basin, river system, ground water aquifer system, or other identifiable and distinct hydrologic regime, including any hydrologically interrelated surface and ground water systems.

(b) In the order initiating an administrative adjudication, the commissioner shall describe the appropriate geographic and hydrologic boundaries of the adjudication area. During the adjudication, the commissioner may adjust the boundaries to ensure the efficient administration of water appropriations among users.

(c) Upon initiation of the adjudication, the commissioner shall

(1) serve the order on each applicant, certificate holder, or permittee listed in the department's records within the adjudication area;

(2) serve the order on any agency of the federal, state, or a local government with management authority over land or water within the adjudication area;

(3) serve the order on any person who owns or claims land within the adjudication area if the land is held in trust by the United States for the person or if the patent, deed, or certificate to the land from the United States was issued under 25 U.S.C. 334 (Indian General Allotment Act of February 8, 1887, 24 Stat. 389, as amended and supplemented), 25 U.S.C. 372 (the Allotment Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 855), former 43 U.S.C. 270-1, 270-2 (the Allotment Act of May 17, 1906, 34 Stat. 197), any other allotment act, or the Alaska Native Townsite Act of May 25, 1926, 44 Stat. 629, and serve the order on the United States on behalf of the person;

(4) serve the order on the United States and the appropriate governing body of the Annette Island Reserve established by 25 U.S.C. 495 (the Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1101) if the land or water, including hydrologically interconnected water, of the Annette Island Reserve is within the adjudication area;

(5) serve the order on any other person claiming a federal reserved water right within the adjudication area;

(6) serve the regional corporation and village corporation established under 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. (Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act) that has a pending land selection or has acquired ownership to land under that act that is located within the adjudication area; and

(7) serve the order on each mining claimant of record with the United States and the state within the adjudication area as of the date of the order initiating the administrative adjudication.

(d) Service of an order under (c) of this section does not constitute an admission by the state that the person served with the order has a water right.

(e) Service of the order under (c)(1) of this section is sufficient if mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address that the applicant, certificate holder, permittee, or claimant has given to the division of the department responsible for administration of water rights. A person served under (c)(1)§(7) of this section who fails to appear in a timely manner and assert a claim as prescribed by the commissioner is estopped from subsequently asserting an objection to the adjudication of that person's water rights within the adjudication area, unless the person is entitled to a federal reserved water right and has failed to consent under (k) of this section.

(f) In an adjudication under this section, the commissioner may appoint an impartial qualified person as a master to preside over the adjudication, to hold hearings, to take testimony, to collect evidence, to propose to the commissioner an order adjudicating the validity of, quantifying, and determining the priority of all water rights, and to take other action the commissioner decides is necessary.

(g) A state agency may assert a water right on behalf of the state in the adjudication.

(h) A division of the department or another state agency may provide documentary and testimonial evidence, research, and scientific analysis during the adjudication. The commissioner may provide evidence, research, or analysis from sources outside government.

(i) In conducting an adjudication, the commissioner may take action necessary for the efficient and fair administration and use of the state's water including

(1) determining indispensable, necessary, and convenient parties to the adjudication;

(2) classifying applicants, certificate holders, permittees, and claimants in groups that share similar interest, such as by the amount of water used or the type of use, and restricting their active participation in the adjudication by appointing group representatives for the purposes of receiving notices, examining witnesses, and other adjudicatory functions;

(3) entering interlocutory orders appropriate to a disposal of all or part of the issues in the adjudication, and designating the orders as final for the purposes of an appeal to the superior court under (l) of this section; and

(4) allocating to a participant the extra costs that the state has incurred in conducting the adjudication because the participant has in bad faith asserted a claim to water wholly without merit or has unreasonably delayed the proceeding.

(j) For the purpose of asserting a water right in an adjudication, a certificate issued under this chapter is prima facie evidence of the water right and its priority date.

(k) If the commissioner has initiated the adjudication and the federal government or a private person who has been served under (c)(2)§(4) of this section asserts a federal reserved water right but fails to consent in writing to the adjudication, then the commissioner may exclude the federal government or the person, respectively, as participants in the adjudication. The commissioner may negotiate the terms of the written consent.

(l) A person adversely affected by a final order of the commissioner adjudicating water rights under this section may appeal to the superior court within 30 days after the decision is mailed or delivered to the person.

(m) The commissioner may adopt regulations setting out procedures for administrative adjudications under this section.

###### Sec. 46.15.166.   Judicial adjudications.

(a) Instead of initiating an adjudication under AS 46.15.165, the commissioner may, with the concurrence of the attorney general, if a federal reserved water right has been or might be asserted by an agency of the United States on its own behalf or on behalf of a person described in AS 46.15.165(c)(3)§(6), file on behalf of the state a complaint in superior court to initiate a judicial adjudication consistent with 43 U.S.C. 666 to quantify and determine the priority of all water rights in a drainage basin, river system, ground water aquifer system, or other identifiable and distinct hydrologic regime, including any hydrologically interrelated surface and ground water systems.

(b) The venue for an action filed under (a) of this section shall be established by rule of the supreme court under AS 22.10.030.

(c) In a complaint brought under (a) of this section, the court may appoint an impartial, qualified person as a master to hold hearings, take testimony, collect evidence, and make recommendations to the court regarding the scope and content of a proposed judicial decree that would finally adjudicate the validity of water rights, quantify them, and determine priorities among the water right appropriations in the adjudication area. Employment by a federal, state, or local government agency does not disqualify an individual from appointment as master under this subsection if the court determines that the individual is otherwise impartial and qualified to act as master. The master may, with the court's permission, take action that the commissioner would be authorized to take in an administrative adjudication under AS 46.15.165.

(d) In an adjudication under this section, the court may incorporate in an order or judgment final orders of the commissioner previously issued under AS 46.15.165.

(e) Proceedings under this section shall be conducted without a jury.

###### Sec. 46.15.167.   Effect of decision.

The final order of the commissioner under AS 46.15.165 and the final judgment of a court under AS 46.15.166 are binding on each party to the adjudication and on each person who subsequently makes an application for a water right. The court or the commissioner may retain jurisdiction for a period of time necessary to implement an adjudication order or judgment and to provide for subsequent water appropriations.

###### Sec. 46.15.168.   Other actions.

(a) The state may timely intervene as a party in a superior court action potentially involving a determination of the validity, quantity, use, reservation, or priority of water rights.

(b) The commissioner may accept a remand from a state or federal court of a water rights dispute and may administratively adjudicate the dispute under AS 46.15.165.

(c) The commissioner may enter into arbitration to resolve a water rights dispute.

(d) The commissioner may incorporate and apply as binding upon the parties to an administrative adjudication under AS 46.15.165 any court decree concerning the state hydrologic regime involved in the adjudication.

###### Sec. 46.15.169.   Federal reserved water rights.

This chapter does not represent a commitment by the state to a specific federal reserved water right.

###### Sec. 46.15.170.   Effect of recording.

(a) A deed, lease, contract, assignment of permit, or other instrument transferring an appropriation is void as against a subsequent innocent purchaser who in good faith paid a valuable consideration for the appropriation or any portion of it and whose instrument is first filed and recorded under AS 46.15.160(b).

(b) A deed, lease, contract, assignment of permit, or other instrument transferring an appropriation that is recorded under AS 46.15.160(b) is constructive notice of its contents to subsequent purchasers of the appropriation or any portion of it. An unrecorded instrument is valid between the parties to it and as against one who has actual notice of it.

###### Sec. 46.15.175.   Termination of permit for violation.

(a) If the commissioner has reason to believe that a person who holds an appropriation permit under this chapter is wilfully violating or has wilfully violated a term, condition, restriction, or limitation of the permit, the commissioner may commence proceedings to terminate the appropriation permit under AS 44.62.330§44.62.630 (Administrative Procedure Act).

(b) When an appropriation permit is terminated under this section, the appropriation of water made by the permit reverts to the state and becomes unappropriated water.

###### Sec. 46.15.180.   Crimes.

(a) A person may not

(1) construct works for an appropriation, or divert, impound, withdraw, or use a significant amount of water from any source without a permit, certificate of appropriation, or authorization issued under this chapter;

(2) violate an order of the commissioner to cease and desist from preventing any water from moving to a person having a prior right to use it;

(3) disobey an order of the commissioner requiring the person to take steps to cause the water to move to a person having a prior right to use it;

(4) fail or refuse to install meters, gauges, or other measuring devices or control works;

(5) violate an order establishing corrective controls for an area or for a source of water;

(6) knowingly make a false or misleading statement in a declaration of existing right.

(b) A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.

(c) Crimes under this section are in addition to any other crimes provided by law.

###### Sec. 46.15.185.   Appeals.

Appeals to the superior court under this chapter are subject to AS 44.62.560§44.62.570 (Administrative Procedure Act).

#### Article 3. Water Resources Board.

###### Sec. 46.15.190.   The Water Resources Board.

There is created the Water Resources Board composed of seven members having a general knowledge of the use and requirements for use of the water of the state and the conservation and protection of it. The commissioner of environmental conservation or a designee shall serve as an additional, ex officio member serving without a vote.  The commissioner of natural resources shall act as the executive secretary of the board, and shall provide clerical staff for the board. Members of the board are appointed by the governor, subject to confirmation by a majority of the members of the legislature in joint session.

###### Sec. 46.15.200.   Term of office.

The term of office for members of the board is four years. If a vacancy occurs, the governor shall fill it by appointment for the unexpired term, subject to AS 39.05.080(4). The appointment shall be submitted to the legislature for confirmation at the next regular session.

###### Sec. 46.15.210.   Duties of the board.

## Chapter 45. Northwest Interstate Compact on Low-level Radioactive Waste Management.

###### Sec. 46.45.010.   Compact enacted.

The Northwest Interstate Compact on Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management, as contained in this section, is enacted into law and entered into on behalf of the State of Alaska with any and all other states legally joining it in a form substantially as follows:

The party states recognize that low-level radioactive wastes are generated by essential activities and services that benefit the citizens of the states.  It is further recognized that the protection of the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes can be accomplished through cooperation of the states in minimizing the amount of handling and transportation required to dispose of such wastes and through the cooperation of the states in providing facilities that serve the region.  It is the policy of the party states to undertake the necessary cooperation to protect the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and to provide for the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes on a continuing basis. It is the purpose of this compact to provide the means for such a cooperative effort among the party states so that the protection of the citizens of the states and the maintenance of the viability of the states' economies will be enhanced while sharing the responsibilities of radioactive low-level waste management.

In this compact

(1) "facility" means any site, location, structure, or property used or to be used for the storage, treatment, or disposal of low-level waste, excluding federal waste facilities;

(2) "generator" means any person, partnership, association, corporation, or any other entity whatsoever, which, as part of its activities, produces low-level radioactive waste;

(3) "host state" means a state in which a facility is located;

(4) "low-level waste" means waste material which contains radioactive nuclides emitting primarily beta or gamma radiation, or both, in concentrations or quantities which exceed applicable federal or state standards for unrestricted release; low-level waste does not include waste containing more than 10 nanocuries of transuranic contaminants per gram of material, nor spent reactor fuel, nor material classified as either high-level waste or waste which is unsuited for disposal by near-surface burial under any applicable federal regulations.

Each party state agrees to adopt practices which will require low-level waste shipments originating within its borders and destined for a facility within another party state to conform to the applicable packaging and transportation requirements and regulations of the host state.  Those practices must include:

(1) maintaining an inventory of all generators within the state that have shipped or expect to ship low-level waste to facilities in another party state;

(2) periodic unannounced inspection of the premises of such generators and the waste management activities on them;

(3) authorization of the containers in which such waste may be shipped, and a requirement that generators use only that type of container authorized by the state;

(4) assurance that inspections of the carriers which transport such waste are conducted by proper authorities, and appropriate enforcement action taken for violation;

(5) after receiving notification from a host state that a generator within the party state is in violation of applicable packaging or transportation standards, the party state will take appropriate action to assure that such violations do not recur. That action may include inspection of every individual low-level waste shipment by that generator.

Each party state may impose fees upon generators and shippers to recover the cost of the inspections and other practices under this article.  Nothing in this section limits any party state's authority to impose additional or more stringent standards on generators or carriers than those required under this paragraph.

(1) Facilities located in any party state, other than facilities established or maintained by individual low-level waste generators for the management of their own low-level waste, shall accept low-level waste generated in any party state if that waste has been packaged and transported according to applicable laws and regulations.

(2) No facility located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of the region comprised of the party states, except as provided in article V.

(3) Until paragraph (2) of this article takes effect, facilities located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of any of the party states only if that waste is accompanied by a certificate of compliance issued by an official of the state in which the waste shipment originated. Such a certificate must be in the form required by the host state, and must contain at least the following:

(A) the generator's name and address;

(B) a description of the contents of the low-level waste container;

(C) a statement that the low-level waste being shipped has been inspected by the official who issued the certificate or by that official's agent or by a representative of the United States nuclear regulatory commission, and found to have been packaged in compliance with applicable federal regulations and such additional requirements as may be imposed by the host state;

(D) a binding agreement by the state of origin to reimburse any party state for any liability or expense incurred as a result of an accidental release of the waste during shipment or after the waste reaches the facility.

(4) Each party state shall cooperate with the other party states in determining the appropriate site of any facility that might be required within the region comprised of the party states, in order to maximize public health and safety while minimizing the use of one party state as the host of such facilities on a permanent basis.  Each party state further agrees that decisions regarding low-level waste management facilities in their region will be reached through a good-faith process which takes into account the burdens borne by each of the party states as well as the benefits each has received.

(5) The party states recognize that the issue of hazardous chemical waste management is similar in many respects to that of low-level waste management. Therefore, in consideration of the State of Washington allowing access to its low-level waste disposal facility by generators in other party states, party states such as Oregon and Idaho which host hazardous chemical waste disposal facilities will allow access to such facilities by generators within other party states.  Nothing in this compact prevents any party state from limiting the nature and type of hazardous chemical or low-level wastes to be accepted at facilities within its borders or from ordering the closure of such facilities, so long as that action by a host state is applied equally to all generators within the region comprised of the party states.

(6) Any host state may establish a schedule of fees and requirements related to its facility, to assure that closure, perpetual care, and maintenance and contingency requirements are met, including adequate bonding.

The governor of each party state shall designate one official of that state as the person responsible for administration of this compact.  The officials so designated comprise the Northwest Low-level Waste Compact Committee.  The committee shall meet as required to consider matters arising under this compact.  The parties shall inform the committee of existing regulations concerning low-level waste management in their states, and shall afford all parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any proposed modifications in those regulations. Notwithstanding any provision of article IV to the contrary, the committee may enter into arrangements with states, provinces, individual generators, or regional compact entities outside the region comprised of the party states for access to facilities on such terms and conditions as the committee considers appropriate.  However, a two-thirds vote of all members, including the affirmative vote of the member of any party state in which a facility affected by such an arrangement is located, is required for the committee to enter into such an arrangement.

(1) Each of the following states is eligible to become a party to this compact: Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.  As to any eligible party, this compact becomes effective upon enactment into law by that party, but it does not become initially effective until enacted into law by two states.  Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing its approval.

(2) After the compact has initially taken effect pursuant to paragraph (1) of this article, any eligible party state may become a party to this compact by the execution of an executive order by the governor of the state.  Any state which becomes a party in this manner ceases to be a party upon the final adjournment of the next general or regular session of its legislature or July 1, 1983, whichever occurs first, unless the compact has by then been enacted as a statute of that state.

(3) Paragraph (2) of article IV of this compact takes effect on July 1, 1983, if consent is given by Congress.  As provided in Public Law 96-573, Congress may withdraw its consent to the compact after every five-year period.

If any provision of this compact, or its application to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, all other provisions of this compact, and the application of all of its provisions to all other persons and circumstances, remain valid; and to this end the provisions of this compact are severable.

###### Sec. 46.45.020.   Implementation.
