When the commissioner has filed the statement under AS 10.06.320, the resolution fixing the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of a wholly unissued class of shares or the resolution establishing and designating a series of shares and fixing and determining the relative rights and preferences of the series becomes effective and constitutes an amendment of the articles of incorporation.

###### Sec. 10.06.325.   Redemption of shares; creation of sinking fund; repurchase agreements.

(a) A corporation may provide in the articles of incorporation for one or more classes or series of

(1) common shares that are redeemable, in whole or in part,

Unless otherwise provided in the subscription agreement, subscriptions for shares, whether made before or after the organization of a corporation, shall be paid in full at the time or in installments as determined by the board. A call made by the board for payment on subscriptions shall be uniform for shares of the same class or shares of the same series.

###### Sec. 10.06.333.   Remedies for default in payment.

In case of default in the payment of an installment or call when payment is due, the corporation may proceed to collect the amount due as any debt due the corporation. The bylaws may prescribe other remedies for failure to pay installments or calls that become due. No remedy working a forfeiture of a subscription, or of the amounts paid on a subscription, may be declared against a subscriber unless the amount due remains unpaid for a period of 20 days after written demand has been made. If mailed, written demand is considered to be made when it is deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope addressed to the subscriber at the last post office address known to the corporation, with postage prepaid.

###### Sec. 10.06.338.   Payment for shares.

(a) Consideration for the issuance of shares may be paid, in whole or in part, in money, in other property, tangible or intangible, or in labor or services actually performed for the corporation.

Subject to a provision in its articles, a corporation may create and issue, whether or not in connection with the issuance and sale of any of its shares or other securities, rights or options entitling the holders of the rights or options to purchase from the corporation shares of any class or classes. These rights or options shall be evidenced in the manner the board approves and, subject to the provisions of the articles, must set out the terms upon which, the time within which, and the price at which the shares may be purchased from the corporation upon the exercise of the right or option. If the rights or options are to be issued to directors, officers, or employees of the corporation or of a subsidiary of the corporation and not to the shareholders generally, their issuance shall be authorized by the approval of the outstanding shares or must be consistent with a plan so approved or ratified. In the absence of fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the board as to the adequacy of the consideration received for the rights or options is conclusive.

The signatures of the president or vice-president and the secretary or assistant secretary upon a certificate may be facsimiles if the certificate is countersigned by a transfer agent or registered by a registrar, other than the corporation itself or an employee of the corporation. If an officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed on the certificate ceases to be an officer before the certificate is issued, the certificate may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if the officer were an officer at the date of its issue.

###### Sec. 10.06.349.   Shares without certificates.

(a) Unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise, the board of directors may authorize the issuance without certificates of some or all of the corporation's classes or series of shares. The authorization does not affect shares that are already represented by certificates until the certificates are surrendered to the corporation.

(b) Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of shares without certificates, the corporation shall send the shareholder a written statement giving the information required by AS 10.06.350 to be on certificates, and, if applicable, the information required by AS 10.06.424(c) to be disclosed to the shareholder when there is no certificate.

###### Sec. 10.06.355.   Issuance of fractional shares or scrip.

(a) A corporation may issue a fractional share, and, by action of its board, may issue, instead of a fractional certificate, scrip in registered or bearer form that entitles the holder to receive a full share upon the surrender of the scrip aggregating a full share.

(b) A fractional share entitles the holder to exercise voting rights, to receive dividends, and to participate in the assets of the corporation in the event of liquidation. Unless otherwise provided in the scrip, scrip does not entitle the holder to exercise voting rights, to receive dividends, or to participate in the assets of the corporation in the event of liquidation.

(c) The board may issue scrip subject to the condition that it is void if not exchanged for full shares before a specified date, or subject to the condition that the shares for which the scrip is exchangeable may be sold by the corporation and the proceeds distributed to the holders of that scrip, or subject to other conditions that the board considers advisable.

(2) immediately after giving effect to the distribution the

(A) sum of the assets of the corporation, exclusive of goodwill, capitalized research and development expenses, evidences of debts owing from directors or officers or secured by the corporation's own shares, and deferred charges, would be at least equal to one and one-fourth times its liabilities, not including deferred taxes, deferred income, and other deferred credits; and

(B) current assets of the corporation would be at least equal to its current liabilities or, if the average of the earnings of the corporation before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of the interest expense of the corporation for those fiscal years, at least equal to one and one-fourth its current liabilities.

(b) For purposes of this section,

(1) in determining the amount of the assets of the corporation, profits derived from an exchange of assets may not be included unless the assets received are currently realizable in cash;

(2) "current assets" may include net amounts that the board has determined in good faith may reasonably be expected to be received from customers during the 12-month period used in calculating current liabilities under existing contractual relationships obligating the customers to make fixed or periodic payments during the term of the contracts after in each case giving effect to future costs not then included in current liabilities but reasonably expected to be incurred by the corporation in performing the contracts.

(c) For the purposes of this chapter, the amount of a distribution payable in property shall be determined on the basis of the value at which the property is carried on the corporation's financial statements in accordance with this section.

(d) Only a corporation that classifies its assets as current assets and fixed assets in accordance with this section is governed by (a)(2)(B) of this section.

(e) For the purposes of this section, the board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited either on financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are fair and reasonable in the circumstances.

A corporation or subsidiary of a corporation may not make a distribution to the corporation's shareholders on any shares of its stock of a class or series that are junior to outstanding shares of another class or series with respect to distribution of assets on liquidation if, after giving effect to the distribution, the excess of its assets, exclusive of goodwill, capitalized research and development expenses, evidences of debts owing from directors or officers or secured by the corporation's own shares, and deferred charges, over its liabilities, not including deferred taxes, deferred income and other deferred credits, would be less than the liquidation preference of all shares having a preference on liquidation over the class or series to which the distribution is made.

The provisions of AS 10.06.358, 10.06.360, 10.06.363, and 10.06.365 do not apply to a purchase or redemption of shares of a deceased shareholder from the proceeds of insurance on the life of the shareholder in excess of the total amount of all premiums paid by the corporation for the insurance, in order to carry out the provisions of an agreement between the corporation and the shareholder to purchase or redeem the shares upon the death of the shareholder.

The liability of the shareholder under this subsection may not exceed the liabilities of the corporation owed to nonconsenting creditors at the time of the violation and the injury suffered by nonconsenting shareholders.

(b) Suit may be brought in the name of the corporation to enforce the liability to

(1) creditors arising under (a) of this section for a violation of AS 10.06.358 or 10.06.360 against any or all shareholders liable by any one or more creditors of the corporation whose debts or claims arose before the time of the distribution to shareholders and who have not consented to the distribution, whether or not they have reduced their claims to judgment; or

(2) shareholders arising under (a) of this section for a violation of AS 10.06.363 or 10.06.365 against any or all shareholders liable by any one or more holders of preferred shares outstanding at the time of the distribution who have not consented to the distribution, without regard to the provisions of AS 10.06.435.

###### Sec. 10.06.385.   Redemption of shares at the option of corporation; manner.

(a) A corporation may redeem any or all shares that are redeemable at its option by

(1) giving notice of redemption; and

(2) payment or deposit of the redemption price of the shares as provided in its articles of incorporation or deposit of the redemption price in accordance with (d) of this section.

(b) Subject to any provisions in its articles with respect to the notice required for redemption of shares, the corporation may give notice of the redemption of any or all shares subject to redemption by publishing a notice of redemption in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial district in which the principal executive office of the corporation is located at least once a week for two successive weeks, beginning not earlier than 60 nor later than 20 days before the date fixed for redemption. The notice of redemption must set out the following:

(1) the class or series of shares or part of any class or series of shares to be redeemed;

(2) the date fixed for redemption;

(3) the redemption price; and

(4) the place at which the shareholders may obtain payment of the redemption price upon surrender of their share certificates or uncertificated shares.

(c) If the corporation gives notice of redemption under (b) of this section, it shall also mail a copy of the notice of redemption to each holder of record of shares to be redeemed as of the date of mailing or record date fixed in accordance with AS 10.06.408, addressed to the holder at the address of the holder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the holder to the corporation for the purpose of notice not earlier than 60 nor later than 20 days before the date fixed for redemption. Failure to comply with this subsection does not invalidate the redemption of the shares.

(d) On or before the date fixed for redemption of redeemable shares, a corporation may deposit with a bank or trust company in this state as a trust fund a sum sufficient to redeem the shares called on the date fixed for redemption, with irrevocable instructions to the bank or trust company to publish a notice of redemption, or to complete the publication if begun, and to pay, on and after or before the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price of the shares to holders of the shares upon the surrender of their share certificates or uncertificated shares. From and after the date of the deposit with the bank or trust company, although before the date fixed for redemption, the shares called for redemption are redeemed and dividends on those shares cease to accrue after the date fixed for redemption. The deposit constitutes full payment of the shares to their holders and from and after the date of the deposit the shares are no longer outstanding and the holders of the shares cease to be shareholders with respect to the shares and have no rights with respect to the shares except the right to receive from the bank or trust company payment of the redemption price of the shares without interest upon surrender of the certificates for the shares or the uncertificated shares, and any right to convert the shares that may exist and continue for a period fixed by the terms of the shares.

###### Sec. 10.06.388.   Acquisition of corporation's own shares; reissuance or retirement.

(a) When a corporation purchases or redeems or otherwise acquires its own shares, the shares are restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares unless the articles prohibit their reissuance.

(b) If the articles prohibit the reissuance of shares upon their acquisition by the corporation, then upon the acquisition of those shares the authorized number of shares of the class and series, if any, to which the shares belonged is reduced by the number of shares acquired and the articles shall be amended to reflect the reduction in authorized shares. If all of the authorized shares of a class or series are acquired and their reissue is prohibited by the articles of incorporation, then the articles shall also be amended to eliminate any statement of rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions relating solely to that class or series. Articles of amendment shall be filed within 60 days of the acquisition of the shares in accordance with the requirements of AS 10.06.512§10.06.514. Approval by the outstanding shares is not required to adopt such articles of amendment.

###### Sec. 10.06.390.   Capitalization of retained earnings.

In the absence of a provision in the bylaws, meetings shall be held at the direction of the board or at the registered office of the corporation.

(b) An annual meeting of the shareholders shall be held at the time as provided in the bylaws or, if the bylaws do not set a time, at a time determined by the board. If the annual meeting is not held within any 13-month period, the superior court may on the application of a shareholder summarily order a meeting to be held.

(c) Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the board, the chair of the board, the president, the holders of not less than one-tenth of all the shares entitled to vote at the meeting, or other persons as may be authorized in the articles of incorporation or the bylaws.

###### Sec. 10.06.408.   Closing of transfer books and fixing record date.

(a) To determine the shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders or an adjournment of a meeting, to determine the shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, or to determine the shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of a corporation may provide that the stock transfer books shall be closed for a stated period not exceeding 70 days. If the stock transfer books are closed to determine shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, they shall be closed for at least 20 days immediately preceding the meeting.

(b) Instead of closing the stock transfer books, the bylaws or, in the absence of an applicable bylaw, the board may fix a date as the record date for the determination of shareholders. This record date may not be more than 60 days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 20 days before the date on which the particular action requiring the determination of shareholders is to be taken. If the stock transfer books are not closed and a record date is not fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders or for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the board declaring the dividend is adopted, is the record date for the determination of shareholders.

The original stock transfer books are prima facie evidence as to the shareholders who are entitled to examine the list or transfer books or to vote at a meeting of shareholders.

(b) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section does not affect the validity of the action taken at the meeting.

(c) An officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books who fails to prepare the list of shareholders, keep it on file for a period of 20 days, or produce and keep it open for inspection at the meeting, as provided in this section, is liable for a penalty of $5,000 and shall pay this sum to a shareholder who makes a written request for performance of the duties imposed by this section.

###### Sec. 10.06.415.   Quorum of shareholders.

(a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, a majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person, by remote communication, or by proxy, constitutes a quorum at a meeting of shareholders, but in no event may a quorum consist of less than one-third of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required by this chapter, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws.

(b) Shareholders present at a meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken other than adjournment is approved by at least a majority of shares required to constitute a quorum.

###### Sec. 10.06.418.   Proxies.

(a) Each person entitled to vote shares may authorize another person or persons to act by proxy with respect to the shares. A proxy purporting to be executed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter is presumed valid.

(b) A proxy is not valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date of the proxy unless it qualifies as an irrevocable proxy under (e) of this section. A proxy continues in full force and effect until revoked by the person executing it, except as provided in this section. A person may revoke a proxy by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked, by a subsequent proxy executed by the person executing the prior proxy and delivered to the corporation, or by attendance at the meeting and voting in person, or by remote communication, by the person executing the proxy. The dates contained on the forms of proxy presumptively determine the order of execution, regardless of the postmark dates on the envelopes in which the proxies are mailed.

(c) A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, written notice of the death or incapacity is received by the corporation.

(d) Except as provided otherwise by written agreement of the parties, the record holder of shares held by a person as pledgee or otherwise as security or that belong to another shall, upon demand and payment of necessary expenses, issue a proxy to vote to the pledgor or to the owner of the shares.

(e) Notwithstanding (c) of this section, a proxy that states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for the period specified in the proxy when it is held by the following or a nominee of the following:

(1) a person to whom the shares are pledged for the performance of an obligation or the payment of a debt;

(2) a person who has purchased, agreed to purchase, or holds an option to purchase the shares or a person who has sold a portion of the shares of the person in the corporation to the maker of the proxy;

(3) a person who has contracted to perform services as an employee of the corporation, if a proxy is required by the contract of employment and if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of the contract of employment, the name of the employee, and the period of employment contracted for;

(4) a person designated by or under an agreement under AS 10.06.425; or

(5) a beneficiary of a trust with respect to shares held by the trust.

(f) Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified in a proxy, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares of the corporation or dies, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has terminated, the agreement under AS 10.06.425 has terminated, or the person ceases to be a beneficiary of the trust. In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or equitable, until the happening of events that, by its terms, discharge the obligations secured by it.

(g) Notwithstanding a provision in a proxy that makes the proxy irrevocable, a proxy is revoked when the shares are transferred unless the transferee knows about the provision or the proxy, or the irrevocability or notice of the proxy appears on a certificate representing the shares.

###### Sec. 10.06.420.   Voting of shares.

(a) An outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders, except as may be otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation. If the articles provide for more or less than one vote for any share, on any matter, every reference in this chapter to a majority or other proportion of shares shall refer to a majority or other proportion of the votes entitled to be cast.

(b) Shares held by the corporation, or shares held by another corporation if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of the other corporation is held by the corporation, may not be voted at a meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at a given time.

(c) A shareholder may vote in person, by remote communication, by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by the authorized attorney-in-fact of the shareholder, or by proxy executed by electronic transmission by the shareholder or by the authorized attorney-in-fact of the shareholder. A proxy executed by electronic transmission must

(1) be directed to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or similar agent that is authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive the transmission; and

(2) include information that demonstrates that the shareholder authorized the transmission.

(d) Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, at an election for directors, each shareholder entitled to vote at the election may vote, in person, by remote communication, or by proxy, the number of shares owned by the shareholder for as many persons as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the shareholder has a right to vote, or to cumulate votes by giving one candidate votes equal to the number of directors multiplied by the number of shares of the shareholder, or by distributing votes on the same principle among any number of candidates. The rights created by this subsection may not be limited by amendment to the articles when the votes cast against the amendment would be sufficient to elect one director if voted cumulatively at an election of the entire board.

(e) Except as prohibited in this subsection, shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by the officer, agent, or proxy as the bylaws of the other corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of a provision, as the board of the other corporation may determine. The shares of a corporation may not be voted if they are owned, directly or indirectly, by a second corporation, domestic or foreign, and the first corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the directors of the second corporation.

(f) Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, or conservator may be voted by that person, in person, by remote communication, or by proxy, without a transfer of the shares into the name of that person. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by the trustee, in person, by remote communication, or by proxy, but a trustee is not entitled to vote shares held by the trustee without a transfer of the shares into the name of the trustee.

(g) Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by the receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by the receiver without a transfer of the shares into the name of the receiver if authority to transfer the shares is contained in an appropriate court order by which the receiver was appointed.

(h) A shareholder whose shares are pledged is entitled to vote the shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee is entitled to vote the shares so transferred.

(i) Beginning on the date on which written notice of redemption of redeemable shares has been mailed to the holders of the shares and a sum sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a bank or trust company with irrevocable instruction and authority to pay the redemption price to the holders of the shares upon surrender of the certificates for the shares or the uncertificated shares, the shares may not vote on any matter and are not considered to be outstanding shares.

(j) If a corporation adopts rules to provide for voting by proxy executed by electronic transmission or by a ballot cast by electronic transmission, the rules must provide that all legally qualified proxies and ballots cast by electronic transmission may be voted in the same manner as the corporation's proxy or ballot.

(k) The board may permit shareholders and shareholders' proxy holders to participate in meetings of the shareholders by remote communication using one or more methods of remote communication, whether the meetings are held at a designated place, by remote communication, or at a designated place and by remote communication. The board may adopt guidelines and procedures that apply to participation in shareholder meetings by remote communication and that the board considers appropriate. The board may limit participation to specified locations or means of communication. A shareholder participating in a meeting by remote communication permitted by the board is considered to be present in person at the meeting.

###### Sec. 10.06.421.   Corporation's acceptance of certain documents.

(a) If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the corporation, if acting in good faith, is entitled to accept the document and give it effect as the act of the shareholder.

(b) If the name signed on a document does not correspond to the name of its shareholder, the corporation, if acting in good faith, is nevertheless entitled to accept the document and give it effect as the act of the shareholder if

(1) the shareholder is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity;

(2) the name signed purports to be that of an administrator, executor, guardian, or conservator representing the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the document;

(3) the name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the document;

(4) the name signed purports to be that of a pledgee, beneficial owner, or attorney-in-fact of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation or the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder has been presented with respect to the document; or

(5) two or more persons are the shareholder as cotenants or fiduciaries, the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the coowners, and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all the coowners.

(c) The corporation is entitled to reject a document if the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has a reasonable basis to doubt the validity of the signature on the document or the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder.

(d) The corporation and its officer or agent who accepts or rejects a document in good faith and in accordance with the standards of this section are not liable in damages to the shareholder for the consequences of the acceptance or rejection.

(e) Corporate action based on the acceptance or rejection of a document under this section is valid unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise.

(f) In this section, "document" means vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment.

###### Sec. 10.06.423.   Actions taken without meeting: written consent; revocation of consent.

(a) Unless prohibited by the articles or the bylaws, whenever under this chapter shareholders are required or permitted to take action by vote, the action may be taken without a meeting by written consents, identical in content, setting out the action taken, signed by the holders of all outstanding shares entitled to vote on the action.

(b) A shareholder giving a written consent, or the shareholder's proxy holder, or a transferee of the shares or a personal representative or proxy holder of the shareholder, may only revoke the consent by a writing received by the corporation before the time that written consents of the shares required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the secretary of the corporation. The revocation is effective upon receipt by the secretary of the corporation.

###### Sec. 10.06.424.   Shareholder agreements.

(a) The shareholders of a corporation may enter into an agreement among all the shareholders to impose restrictions on the transfer or registration of shares of the corporation to

(1) maintain the corporation's status, including election of S corporation status under 26 U.S.C. (Internal Revenue Code), when the status depends on the number or identity of its shareholders; in this paragraph, "S corporation" has the meaning given in 26 U.S.C. 1361;

(2) preserve exemptions under federal or state securities laws;

(3) ensure that shareholders will be able to control who may participate in the corporation's business;

(4) ensure that shareholders who wish to retire will be able to liquidate their investments without disrupting corporate affairs;

(5) ensure that estates of deceased shareholders will be able to liquidate the decedents' shares in the corporation;

(6) obligate the shareholder first to offer to the corporation or other persons, separately, consecutively, or simultaneously, an opportunity to acquire the restricted shares;

(7) obligate the corporation or other persons, separately, consecutively, or simultaneously, to acquire the restricted shares;

(8) require the corporation, the holder of any class of its shares, or another person, to approve the transfer of restricted shares, if the requirement is not manifestly unreasonable; and

(9) accomplish another reasonable purpose.

(b) The shareholders of a corporation may enter into an agreement among all of the shareholders to provide for the selection of directors and officers.

(c) The existence of a shareholders' agreement that is consistent with this section shall be noted conspicuously on the front or back of each stock certificate together with a statement indicating that the agreement, or a copy of the agreement, is on file at the principal office of the corporation and that the corporation will allow inspection of the agreement or furnish a copy of the agreement without charge. If the share has been issued under AS 10.06.349 without a certificate, a statement that discloses the existence of the shareholders' agreement shall be sent within a reasonable time to the shareholder.

(d) Shares issued before compliance with (c) of this section, if acquired by a person without knowledge of the shareholders' agreement, are not subject to the shareholders' agreement.

(e) A shareholders' agreement may not alter or waive AS 10.06.350, 10.06.358, 10.06.360, 10.06.430, 10.06.438, 10.06.544, 10.06.570, 10.06.633, 10.06.648, or 10.06.653.

(f) In this section, "shares" includes a security that is convertible into shares or that carries a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.

###### Sec. 10.06.425.   Voting trusts and agreements among shareholders.

(a) Any number of shareholders of a corporation may create a voting trust for the purpose of conferring upon a trustee or trustees the right to vote or otherwise represent their shares by entering into a written voting trust agreement specifying the terms and conditions of the voting trust, by depositing a copy of the agreement with the corporation at its registered office, and by transferring their shares to the trustee or trustees for the purpose of the agreement. The trustee or trustees shall keep a record of the holders of voting trust certificates evidencing a beneficial interest in the voting trust, giving the names and addresses of all the holders and the number and class of the shares for which the voting trust certificates are issued, and shall deposit a copy of the record with the corporation at its registered office. The copies of the voting trust agreement and the record deposited with the corporation are subject to the same right of examination by a shareholder of the corporation, in person or by agent or attorney, as are the books and records of the corporation under AS 10.06.430, and the copies of the agreement and the record are subject to examination by a holder of record of voting trust certificates, either in person or by agent or attorney, at a reasonable time for a proper purpose. This subsection does not invalidate an irrevocable proxy complying with AS 10.06.418(e).

(b) Shareholders may enter into a voting agreement or any other agreement if the agreement is consistent with this chapter.

###### Sec. 10.06.428.   Shareholders' preemptive rights.

(a) Except to the extent limited or denied by this section or by the articles of incorporation, shareholders have a preemptive right to acquire unissued shares or securities convertible into such shares or carrying a right to subscribe to or acquire shares.

(b) Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation,

(1) there is no preemptive right

(A) to acquire any shares issued to directors, officers, or employees if approved by the outstanding shares or if authorized by and consistent with a plan previously approved by the outstanding shares; or

(B) to acquire shares sold for consideration other than for cash;

(2) holders of shares of a class that is preferred or limited as to dividends or assets are not entitled to a preemptive right;

(3) holders of shares of common stock are not entitled to a preemptive right to shares of a class that is preferred or limited as to dividends or assets or to any obligations, unless convertible into shares of common stock or carrying a right to subscribe to or acquire shares of common stock;

(4) holders of common stock without voting power are not entitled to a preemptive right to shares of common stock with voting power;

(5) a preemptive right is only an opportunity to acquire shares or other securities under the terms and conditions as the board may fix for the purpose of providing a fair and reasonable opportunity for the exercise of the preemptive right.

###### Sec. 10.06.430.   Books and records.

(a) A corporation organized under this chapter shall keep correct and complete books and records of account, minutes of proceedings of its shareholders, board, and committees of the board, and a record of its shareholders, containing the names and addresses of all shareholders and the number and class of the shares held by each. The books and records of account, minutes, and the record of shareholders may be in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time.

(b) A corporation organized under this chapter shall make its books and records of account, or certified copies of them, reasonably available for inspection and copying at the registered office or principal place of business in the state by a shareholder of the corporation. Shareholder inspection shall be upon written demand stating with reasonable particularity the purpose of the inspection. The inspection may be in person or by agent or attorney, at a reasonable time and for a proper purpose. Only books and records of account, minutes, and the record of shareholders directly connected to the stated purpose of the inspection may be inspected or copied.

(c) An officer or agent who, or a corporation that, refuses to allow a shareholder, or the agent or attorney of the shareholder, to examine and make copies from its books and records of account, minutes, and record of shareholders, for a proper purpose, is liable to the shareholder for a penalty in the amount of 10 percent of the value of the shares owned by the shareholder or $5,000, whichever is greater, in addition to other damages or remedy given the shareholder by law. It is a defense to an action for penalties under this section that the person suing has within two years sold or offered for sale a list of shareholders of the corporation or any other corporation or has aided or abetted a person in procuring a list of shareholders for this purpose, or has improperly used information secured through a prior examination of the books and records of account, minutes, or record of shareholders of the corporation or any other corporation, or was not acting in good faith or for a proper purpose in making the person's demand.

(d) Nothing in this chapter impairs the power of a court, upon proof by a shareholder of a demand properly made and for a proper purpose, to compel the production for examination by the shareholder of the books and records of account, minutes, and record of shareholders of a corporation.

###### Sec. 10.06.433.   Annual report to shareholders; content; financial statement on request.

(a) The board shall send an annual report to the shareholders not later than 180 days after the close of the fiscal year or the date on which notice of the annual meeting in the next fiscal year is sent under AS 10.06.410, whichever is first. A corporation with less than 100 holders of record of its shares, as determined under AS 10.06.408, is exempt from this annual requirement unless its articles or bylaws impose the requirement. The annual report must contain a balance sheet as of the end of the fiscal year and an income statement and statement of changes in financial position for the fiscal year, accompanied by a report on the fiscal year by independent accountants or, if there is no such report, the certificate of an authorized officer of the corporation that the statements were prepared without audit from the books and records of the corporation.

(b) In addition to the financial statement required by (a) of this section, unless a corporation has a nonexempt class of securities registered under 15 U.S.C. 78l (Securities Exchange Act of 1934) or files reports under 43 U.S.C. 1606(c), 1607(c), and 1625 (Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act), the annual report of a corporation having 100 or more holders of record of its shares must also briefly describe

(1) all transactions, excluding compensation of officers and directors, during the previous fiscal year involving an amount in excess of $40,000, other than contracts let at competitive bid or services rendered at prices regulated by law, to which the corporation or its parent or subsidiary was a party, and in which a director or officer of the corporation or of a subsidiary or, if known to the corporation, its parent, or subsidiary, a holder of more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation had a direct or indirect material interest; the report must include the name of the person, the person's relationship to the corporation, the nature of the person's interest in the transaction and, if practicable, the amount of the interest; in the case of a transaction with a partnership of which the person is a partner, only the interest of the partnership need be stated; a report is not required in the case of transactions approved by the shareholders under AS 10.06.478;

(2) the amount and circumstances of indemnifications or advances aggregating more than $10,000 paid during the fiscal year to an officer or director of the corporation under AS 10.06.490; a report is not required in the case of indemnification approved by the shareholders under AS 10.06.490(d)(3).

(c) A shareholder or shareholders holding at least five percent of the outstanding shares of a class of a corporation may make a written request to the corporation for an income statement of the corporation for the three-month, six-month, or nine-month period of the current fiscal year ended more than 30 days before the date of the request and a balance sheet of the corporation as of the end of the period and, in addition, if an annual report for the last fiscal year has not been sent to shareholders, the statements required by (a) of this section for the last fiscal year. The statement shall be delivered or mailed to the person making the request within 30 days of the request. A copy of the statements shall be kept on file in the principal office of the corporation for 12 months and they shall be exhibited at all reasonable times to a shareholder demanding an examination of the statements or a copy of the statements shall be mailed to that shareholder.

(d) A corporation shall, upon the written request of a shareholder, mail to the shareholder a copy of the last annual, semiannual, or quarterly income statement that it has prepared and a balance sheet as of the end of the period.

(e) The quarterly income statements and balance sheets referred to in this section shall be accompanied by any report on those statements by independent accountants engaged by the corporation or the certificate of an authorized officer of the corporation that the financial statements were prepared without audit from the books and records of the corporation.

(f) A corporation that neglects, fails, or refuses to prepare or submit the financial statements required by this section is subject to a penalty of $25 for each day that the failure or refusal continues, beginning 30 days after receipt of written request that the duty be performed from one entitled to make the request, up to a maximum of $1,500. The penalty shall be paid to the shareholder or shareholders jointly making the request for performance of the duty or duties imposed by this section. In addition to this penalty, the court may enforce the duty of making and mailing or delivering the information and financial statements required by this section and, for good cause shown, may extend the time limits under this section.

(g) This section applies to a domestic corporation and a foreign corporation having its principal executive office in this state or customarily holding meetings of its board in this state.

(h) A corporation may deliver the annual report required under (a) of this section

(1) by mail;

(2) in person; or

(3) by electronic transmission, or by a posting on an electronic network together with a separate notice of the specific posting to the shareholder, if the corporation has received a writing or an electronic transmission from the shareholder that includes information demonstrating that the shareholder authorized the electronic transmission and delivery of annual reports by electronic transmission or electronic posting.

###### Sec. 10.06.435.   Shareholders' derivative action.

(a) An action may be brought in the right of a domestic or foreign corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by a holder of shares of the corporation, of voting trust certificates of the corporation, or of a beneficial interest in shares of the corporation.

(b) In a derivative action, the complaint shall be verified and must allege that the plaintiff was a shareholder, of record or beneficially, or the holder of voting trust certificates at the time or during any part of the transaction of which the plaintiff complains or that the plaintiff 's shares or voting trust certificates devolved upon the plaintiff by operation of law from a holder who was a holder at the time or during any part of the transaction complained of. A shareholder who does not meet the requirements of this section may be allowed in the discretion of the court to maintain the action on a preliminary showing to and determination by the court, by motion and after a hearing at which the court considers evidence, by affidavit or testimony, as it considers material, that

(1) there is a strong prima facie case in favor of the claim asserted on behalf of the corporation;

(2) no other similar action has been or is likely to be instituted;

(3) the plaintiff acquired the shares before there was disclosure to the public or to the plaintiff of the wrongdoing of which the plaintiff complains;

(4) unless the action can be maintained the defendant may retain a gain derived from the defendant's wilful breach of a fiduciary duty; and

(5) the requested relief will not result in unjust enrichment of the corporation or a shareholder of the corporation.

(c) Unless excused on grounds that a majority of the directors is implicated in or under the direct or indirect control of a person who is implicated in the injury to the corporation, before an action in the right of a domestic or foreign corporation is instituted a plaintiff who has standing under (b) of this section shall make a formal demand upon the board to secure the action the plaintiff desires.

(d) If a shareholder fails to make a formal demand under (c) of this section the complaint shall state with particularity the facts establishing excuse under (c) of this section. In a motion to dismiss for failure to make demand on the board the shareholder shall have the burden to establish excuse.

(e) In a case in which demand on the board is made under (c) of this section, a decision by the board that, in its business judgment, the litigation would not be in the best interest of the corporation terminates the right created by (a) of this section.

(f) In a case in which demand on the board is excused under (c) of this section or the decision of the board under (e) of this section is rejected by the court as inconsistent with the directors' duties of care and loyalty to the corporation, a plaintiff who has standing under (b) of this section shall have the right to commence or continue the action created by (a) of this section. Notwithstanding (c) or (e) of this section, disinterested, noninvolved directors acting as the board or a duly charged board committee may petition the court to dismiss the plaintiff 's action on grounds that in their independent, informed business judgment the action is not in the best interests of the corporation. The petitioners shall have the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the court their disinterest, independence from any direct or indirect control of defendants in the action, and the informed basis on which they have exercised their asserted business judgment. If the court is satisfied that the petitioners are disinterested, independent, and informed it shall then exercise an independent appraisal of the plaintiff 's action to determine whether, considering the welfare of the corporation and relevant issues of public policy, it should dismiss the action.

(g) A shareholder action otherwise in conformity with this section may not be dismissed because the alleged injury or wrong to the corporation has been ratified by the outstanding shares. A court may consider the fact of ratification in framing any order for relief to which it considers the corporation entitled.

(h) In an action instituted or maintained in the right of a corporation by the holder or holders of record of less than five percent of the outstanding shares of any class of the corporation or of voting trust certificates for these shares, the corporation in whose right the action is brought or the defendants may at any time before final judgment move the court to require the plaintiff to give security for the reasonable expense, including attorney fees, that may be incurred by the moving party. The amount of the security may be increased or decreased from time to time in the discretion of the court upon a showing that the security has become inadequate or excessive. The corporation or other defendants may have recourse to the security in an amount as the court may determine upon the termination of the derivative action, whether or not the court finds the action was brought without reasonable cause.

(i) A derivative action may not be discontinued, abandoned, compromised, or settled without the approval of the court having jurisdiction of the action. If the court determines that the interests of the shareholders or any class or classes of shareholders will be substantially affected by a discontinuance, abandonment, compromise, or settlement, the court in its discretion may direct that notice, by publication or otherwise, shall be given to the shareholders or class or classes of shareholders whose interests will be affected. If the court directs notice to be given, it shall determine which of the parties to the action shall bear the expense of giving the notice in an amount the court determines to be reasonable in the circumstances. The amount shall be awarded as special costs of the action.

(j) If the derivative action is successful, in whole or in part, or if anything is received as a result of the judgment, compromise, or settlement of that action, the court may award to the plaintiff or plaintiffs reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, and shall direct an accounting to the corporation for the remainder of the proceeds. This subsection does not apply to a judgment rendered only for the benefit of injured shareholders and limited to a recovery of the loss or damage sustained by them.

###### Sec. 10.06.438.   Liability of shareholders, subscribers, and others arising out of shares.

(a) A holder of or subscriber to shares of a corporation is under no obligation to the corporation or its creditors as holder or subscriber with respect to the shares other than the obligation to pay the corporation the full consideration for which the shares were issued or to be issued.

(b) An assignee or transferee of shares, or of a subscription for shares, in good faith and without knowledge or notice that the full consideration has not been paid, is not personally liable to the corporation or its creditors for any unpaid portion of the consideration.

(c) An executor, administrator, conservator, guardian, trustee, assignee for the benefit of creditors, or receiver is not personally liable to the corporation or its creditors for any unpaid portion of the consideration.

(d) A pledgee or other holder of shares as collateral security is not personally liable as a shareholder.

#### Article 6. Directors, Officers, Employees, and Agents.

###### Sec. 10.06.450.   Board of directors; duty of care; right of inspection; dissent.

(a) All corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of a corporation shall be managed under the direction of, a board of directors except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter. If a provision is made under AS 10.06.468 or in the articles, the powers, duties, privileges, and liabilities conferred or imposed upon the board by this chapter shall be exercised, performed, extended, and assumed to the extent and by the person or persons to whom they are delegated as provided in AS 10.06.468 or in the articles. Directors need not be residents of this state or shareholders of the corporation unless required by the articles or bylaws. The articles or bylaws may prescribe other qualifications for directors. The board may fix the compensation of directors unless otherwise provided in the articles.

(b) A director shall perform the duties of a director, including duties as a member of a committee of the board on which the director may serve, in good faith, in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation, and with the care, including reasonable inquiry, that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. Except as provided in (c) of this section, a director is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by

(1) one or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;

(2) counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters that the director reasonably believes to be within the person's professional or expert competence; or

(3) a committee of the board upon which the director does not serve, designated in accordance with a provision of the articles or the bylaws, as to matters within the authority of the committee if the director reasonably believes the committee to merit confidence.

(c) A director is not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by (b) of this section unwarranted.

(d) A director has the absolute right at a reasonable time to inspect and copy all books, records, and documents of every kind and to inspect the physical properties of the corporation or a domestic or foreign subsidiary of the corporation. Inspection by a director may be made in person or by agent or attorney and the right of inspection includes the right to copy and make extracts. This section applies to a director of a foreign corporation having its principal executive office in this state or customarily holding meetings of its board in this state.

(e) A director of a corporation who is present at a meeting of its board at which action on a corporate matter is taken is presumed to have assented to the action taken unless the director's dissent is entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless the director files a written dissent to the action with the secretary of the meeting before adjournment or forwards the dissent by certified mail to the secretary of the corporation immediately after adjournment. The right to dissent does not apply to a director who voted in favor of the action.

###### Sec. 10.06.453.   Number, election, and tenure of directors; initial directors.

(a) The board of directors shall consist of one or more members. The number of directors shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the bylaws, unless the articles fix the number of directors, in which case a change in the number of directors shall be made only by amendment of the articles. If the number of directors is not otherwise set, the number of directors is three.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in AS 10.06.230 and this section, the number of directors may be increased or decreased by amendment of the articles or the bylaws or by action of the board or the shareholders under the specific provisions of an article or a bylaw adopted by approval of the outstanding shares. A change in the number of directors, including by amendment of the articles, is subject to the following limitations:

(1) if the board is authorized by the articles or the bylaws to change the number of directors, whether by amending the bylaws or by taking action under the specific provision of an article or a bylaw adopted by approval of the outstanding shares, the amendment or action shall require the vote of a majority of the entire board;

(2) a decrease in the number of directors may not shorten the term of an incumbent director.

(c) The articles may provide for the election of one or more directors by the holders of the shares of a class or series voting as a class or series.

(d) The names and addresses of the members of the first board may be stated in the articles. The members of the first board hold office until the first annual meeting of shareholders, and until their successors have been elected and qualified.

(e) At the first annual meeting of shareholders and at each subsequent annual meeting the shareholders shall elect directors to hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting, except in the case of the classification of directors as permitted by AS 10.06.455. A director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected and qualified.

###### Sec. 10.06.455.   Classification of directors.

(a) If the board consists of three or more members, the articles of incorporation may provide that instead of electing all the directors annually the directors be divided into either two or three classes, each class to be as nearly equal in number as possible, with the term of office of directors of the first class to expire at the first annual meeting of shareholders after their election, that of the second class to expire at the second annual meeting after their election, and that of the third class, if any, to expire at the third annual meeting after their election. At each annual meeting after the classification the number of directors equal to the number of the class whose term expires at the time of the meeting shall be elected to hold office until the second succeeding annual meeting if there are two classes, or until the third succeeding annual meeting if there are three classes. A classification of directors is not effective before the first annual meeting of shareholders.

(b) Unless cumulative voting rights under AS 10.06.420(d) have been eliminated by the articles of incorporation, an amendment of the articles that would establish or require classification of the board under (a) of this section may not be adopted if the votes cast against the amendment would be sufficient to elect a director if voted cumulatively at an election of the entire board.

###### Sec. 10.06.458.   Declaration of board vacancy where director of unsound mind.

The board may declare vacant the office of a director who has been declared of unsound mind by a court order.

###### Sec. 10.06.460.   Removal of director without cause.

(a) At a regular or special meeting for which notice is given under AS 10.06.410 and this section, any or all of the directors may be removed without reason if the removal is approved by the outstanding shares, subject to the following:

(1) in the case of a corporation with 500 or more holders of record entitled to vote on the removal and election of directors, as determined under AS 10.06.408, written or printed notice of intention to seek removal under this section shall be delivered either personally or by mail to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting and if notice of intention to seek removal under this section is

(A) delivered to the president or secretary of the corporation at least 75 days before the date of the annual meeting it shall be included on the notice stating the place, day, and hour of the annual meeting without cost to the shareholder seeking removal; or

(B) not timely under (A) of this paragraph the shareholder seeking removal may, at the expense of that shareholder, deliver either personally or by mail the notice required by (1) of this subsection at any time up to 20 days before the date set for the annual meeting; if mailed, notice is considered delivered when deposited with postage prepaid in the United States mail addressed to the shareholder at the address appearing on the stock transfer books of the corporation;

(2) unless cumulative voting rights under AS 10.06.420(d) have been eliminated by the articles of incorporation, a director may not be removed, unless the entire board is removed, if the votes cast against removal would be sufficient to elect a director if voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast; and

(3) if by provision in the articles of incorporation the holders of the shares of a class or series, voting as a class or series, are entitled to elect one or more directors, a director elected in that manner may be removed only by the applicable vote of the holders of the shares of that class or series.

(b) Except as provided in this section and AS 10.06.458, 10.06.463, and 10.06.465(c), a director may not be removed before the expiration of the term of office of the director.

###### Sec. 10.06.463.   Removal of director by superior court.

The superior court may, at the suit of the board or the shareholders holding at least 10 percent of the number of outstanding shares of any class, remove from office a director for fraudulent or dishonest acts, gross neglect of duty, or gross abuse of authority or discretion with reference to the corporation and may bar from reelection a director removed in that manner for a period prescribed by the court. The corporation shall be made a party to the suit.

###### Sec. 10.06.465.   Vacancies and resignation; special meeting of shareholders.

(a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws of the corporation and except for a vacancy created by the removal of a director, vacancies on the board may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Unless the articles or a bylaw adopted with approval of the outstanding shares provide that the board may fill vacancies occurring in the board by reason of removal of directors, the vacancies may be filled only by approval of the shareholders.

(b) The shareholders may elect a director to fill a vacancy not filled by the directors. An election by written consent to fill a vacancy requires the consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.

(c) If, after the filling of a vacancy by the directors, the directors who have been elected by the shareholders constitute less than a majority of the directors, a holder or holders of an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the shares outstanding at the time may call a special meeting of shareholders under  AS 10.06.405 to elect the entire board. The term of office of a director terminates upon the election and qualification of a successor.

(d) Notwithstanding  AS 10.06.453(e), a director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary, or the board of directors of the corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of the resignation. If the resignation is effective at a future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation becomes effective.

###### Sec. 10.06.468.   Executive and other board committees.

(a) If authorized by the articles or the bylaws of the corporation, the board, by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire board, may designate from among its members an executive committee and other committees of the board. Unless the number of directors fixed in accordance with  AS 10.06.453 is less than three, each committee shall have at least two members, who serve at the pleasure of the board of directors. Each committee, to the extent provided in the resolution or the articles or bylaws of the corporation, has the authority of the board, except that a committee may not

(1) declare dividends or distributions;

(2) approve or recommend to shareholders actions or proposals required by this chapter to be approved by shareholders;

(3) designate candidates for the office of director, for purposes of proxy solicitation or otherwise, or fill vacancies on the board or any committee of the board;

(4) amend the bylaws;

(5) approve a plan or merger not requiring shareholder approval;

(6) capitalize retained earnings;

(7) authorize or approve the reacquisition of shares unless under a general formula or method specified by the board;

(8) authorize or approve the issuance or sale of, or a contract to issue or sell, shares or designate the terms of a series of a class of shares, unless the board, having acted regarding general authorization for the issuance or sale of shares, a contract to issue or sell, or the designation of a series, authorizes a committee, under a general formula or method specified by the board by resolution or by adoption of a stock option or other plan, to fix the terms of a contract for the sale of the shares and to fix the terms upon which the shares may be issued or sold, including, without limitation, the price, the dividend rate, provisions for redemption, sinking funds, conversion, voting or preferential rights, and provisions for other features of a class of shares, or a series of a class of shares, with full power in the committee to adopt a final resolution setting out all the terms of a series for filing with the commissioner under this chapter; or

(9) authorize, approve, or ratify contracts or other transactions between the corporation and one or more of its directors, or between the corporation and a corporation, firm, or association in which one or more of its directors has a material financial interest under  AS 10.06.478.

(b) The designation of a committee, the delegation to the committee of authority, or action by the committee under that authority does not alone constitute compliance by a member of the board or the committee in question with the responsibility to act in good faith, in a manner the member reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation, and with the care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.

###### Sec. 10.06.470.   Meetings: call, place, notice, and waiver.

(a) A regular or special meeting of the board or a committee of the board may be called by the chair of the board, the president, a vice-president, the secretary, or a director and may be held at any place designated under the bylaws inside or outside the state, by remote communication, or at a designated place inside or outside the state and by remote communication. A member of the board or of a committee of the board participating in a meeting by remote communication is considered to be present in person at the meeting for the purposes of reaching a quorum under AS 10.06.473 and for voting at the meeting.

(b) A regular meeting of the board or a committee designated by the board may be held without notice if the time and place of the meeting is fixed by the bylaws or the board. A special meeting of the board or a committee designated by the board shall be held as provided in the bylaws or, in the absence of bylaw provision, after either notice in writing sent 10 days before the meeting or notice by electronic means, personal messenger, or comparable person-to-person communication given at least 72 hours before the meeting. Unless otherwise provided in the bylaws the notice of a special meeting shall include disclosure of the business to be transacted and the purpose of the meeting.

(c) Notice of a meeting need not be given to a director who signs a waiver of notice, whether before or after the meeting, or who attends the meeting without protesting before the meeting or at its commencement the lack of notice.

###### Sec. 10.06.473.   Quorum of directors.

(a) A majority of the number of directors fixed by the articles or bylaws of a corporation constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business unless a greater number is required by the articles or bylaws. The act of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present is the act of the board, unless the act of a greater number is required by the articles or the bylaws.

(b) The provisions of this section apply with equal force to committees of the board established under AS 10.06.468 and action by committees.

###### Sec. 10.06.475.   Alternative meeting arrangements; informal action by directors.

(a) Unless prohibited by the articles or bylaws of the corporation, the board of a corporation or a committee designated by the board can validly conduct a meeting by communicating simultaneously with each other by means of conference telephones or similar communications equipment.

(b) Unless prohibited by the articles or bylaws of the corporation, action required or permitted to be taken by the board or a committee designated by the board may be taken without a meeting on written consents, identical in content, setting out the action taken and signed by all the members of the board or the committee. The written consents shall be filed with the minutes. The consents have the same effect as a unanimous vote.

###### Sec. 10.06.478.   Director conflicts of interest.

(a) A contract or other transaction between a corporation and one or more of the directors of the corporation, or between a corporation and a corporation, firm, or association in which one or more of the directors of the corporation has a material financial interest, is neither void nor voidable because the director or directors or the other corporation, firm, or association are parties or because the director or directors are present at the meeting of the board that authorizes, approves, or ratifies the contract or transaction, if the material facts as to the transaction and as to the director's interest are fully disclosed or known to the

(1) shareholders and the contract or transaction is approved by the shareholders in good faith, with the shares owned by the interested director or directors not being entitled to vote; or

(2) board, and the board authorizes, approves, or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by a sufficient vote without counting the vote of the interested director or directors, and the person asserting the validity of the contract or transaction sustains the burden of proving that the contract or transaction was just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it was authorized, approved, or ratified.

(b) A common directorship does not alone constitute a material financial interest within the meaning of this section. A director is not interested within the meaning of this section in a resolution fixing the compensation of another director as a director, officer, or employee of the corporation, notwithstanding the fact that the first director is also receiving compensation from the corporation.

(c) A contract or other transaction between a corporation and a corporation or association of which one or more directors of the corporation are directors is neither void nor voidable because the director or directors are present at the meeting of the board that authorizes, approves, or ratifies the contract or transaction, if the material facts of the transaction and the director's other directorship are fully disclosed or known to the board and the board authorizes, approves, or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by a sufficient vote without counting the vote of the common director or directors or the contract or transaction is approved by the shareholders in good faith. This subsection does not apply to contracts or transactions covered by (a) of this section.

(d) Interested or common directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the board that authorizes, approves, or ratifies a contract or transaction.

(e) Nothing in this section affects the prohibitions or restraints imposed by AS 45.50.

###### Sec. 10.06.480.   Liability of directors and contributions from shareholders and other directors.

(a) In addition to other liabilities, a director is liable in the following circumstances unless the director complies with the standard provided in AS 10.06.450(b) for the performance of the duties of directors:

(1) a director who votes for or assents to a distribution to the corporation's shareholders contrary to the provisions of AS 10.06.358, 10.06.360, 10.06.363, or 10.06.365 or contrary to a restriction in the articles of incorporation is liable to the corporation, jointly and severally with all other directors voting for or assenting to the distribution, for the amount of the distribution that is paid or the value of the assets that are distributed in excess of the amount of the distribution that could have been paid or distributed without violation of AS 10.06.305§10.06.390 or the restrictions of the articles of incorporation;

(2) a director who votes for or assents to a distribution to the corporation's shareholders during the liquidation of the corporation without the payment and discharge of, or making adequate provision for, all known debts, obligations, and liabilities of the corporation is liable to the corporation, jointly and severally with all other directors voting for or assenting to distribution, for the value of the assets that are distributed, to the extent that the debts, obligations, and liabilities of the corporation are not thereafter paid and discharged;

(3) a director who votes for or assents to a loan of assets of the corporation to an officer or employee or a loan secured by the corporation's shares contrary to the provisions of AS 10.06.485 or contrary to a restriction in the articles of incorporation is liable to the corporation, jointly and severally with all other directors voting for or assenting to the loan, for the amount of the loan that is in excess of a loan that could have been extended without a violation of AS 10.06.485 or the restriction in the articles of incorporation.

(b) A director against whom a claim is asserted under this section for the distribution of assets of the corporation is entitled to contribution from shareholders who accepted or received the assets, knowing the distribution to have been made in violation of this chapter, in proportion to the amounts received by them. A director against whom a claim is asserted under this section for the extension of a loan is entitled to contribution from the person receiving the loan.

(c) A director against whom a claim is asserted under this section is entitled to contribution from other directors who voted for or assented to the action upon which the claim is asserted.

###### Sec. 10.06.483.   Officers; tenure, resignation, authority, and duties.

(a) A corporation shall have a president, a secretary, a treasurer, and other officers with titles and duties as stated in the bylaws of the corporation or determined by the board and as may be necessary to enable the corporation to sign instruments and share certificates. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person, except the offices of president and secretary. When all of the issued and outstanding stock of the corporation is owned by one person, the person may hold all or any combination of offices.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws of the corporation, officers shall be chosen by the board and serve at the pleasure of the board, subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under a contract of employment. An officer may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the corporation under a contract to which the officer is a party.

(c) All officers as between themselves and the corporation have the authority and shall perform the duties in the management of the corporation as provided in the bylaws of the corporation or, to the extent not provided in the bylaws, as provided by the board.

(d) Subject to the provisions of AS 10.06.020, a note, mortgage, evidence of indebtedness, contract, conveyance, or other instrument in writing, and an assignment or endorsement of these, executed or entered into between the corporation and another person, if signed by two individuals, one of whom is the chairman of the board, the president, or a vice-president and the other of whom is the secretary, an assistant secretary, the treasurer, or an assistant treasurer of the corporation, is not invalidated as to the corporation by a lack of authority of the signing officers in the absence of actual knowledge on the part of the other person that the signing officers had no authority to execute the instrument.

(e) An officer shall perform the duties of the office in good faith and with that degree of care, including reasonable inquiry, that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. Except as provided in (f) of this section, an officer is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data in each case prepared or presented by legal counsel or public accountants.

(f) An officer is not acting in good faith if the officer has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by (e) of this section unwarranted.

###### Sec. 10.06.485.   Loans to directors, officers, and employees.

(a) A loan may not be extended to an officer or employee without authorization by the board. A loan may not be extended to a director without the approval of two-thirds of the voting shares. An employee or officer who is also a director is considered a director for purposes of this section. A shareholder is not disqualified from voting on a loan to a shareholder as a director because of personal interest.

(b) A loan to a director, officer, or employee and a loan secured by the shares of the corporation may not be made unless the loan would be permissible as a distribution under AS 10.06.358§10.06.365. A loan under this subsection impairs the retained earnings or paid-in capital accounts to the extent of the loan.

(c) For purposes of this section, a loan may consist of cash, securities, or personal or real property.

(d) If a corporation acts as a guarantor on a loan to a director, officer, or employee, the guarantee is treated as a loan under this section.

(e) A director, officer, or employee of an affiliate corporation is a director, officer, or employee of the lending corporation for purposes of this section.

(f) A loan is to be judged by the duties of directors and officers to act in good faith in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and with the care, including reasonable inquiry, that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.

###### Sec. 10.06.490.   Indemnification of officers, directors, employees, and agents; insurance.

(a) A corporation may indemnify a person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a party to a completed, pending, or threatened action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. Indemnification may include reimbursement of expenses, attorney fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the action or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to a criminal action or proceeding, the person had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. The termination of an action or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to a criminal action or proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.

(b) A corporation may indemnify a person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a party to a completed, pending, or threatened action by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. Indemnification may include reimbursement for expenses and attorney fees actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. Indemnification may not be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which the person has been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of the person's duty to the corporation except to the extent that the court in which the action was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for expenses that the court considers proper.

(c) To the extent that a director, officer, employee, or agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of an action or proceeding referred to in (a) or (b) of this section, or in defense of a claim, issue, or matter in the action or proceeding, the director, officer, employee, or agent shall be indemnified against expenses and attorney fees actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense.

(d) Unless otherwise ordered by a court, indemnification under (a) or (b) of this section may only be made by a corporation upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because the director, officer, employee, or agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set out in (a) and (b) of this section. The determination shall be made by

(1) the board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action or proceeding;

(2) independent legal counsel in a written opinion if a quorum under (1) of this subsection is

(A) not obtainable; or

(B) obtainable but a majority of disinterested directors so directs; or

(3) approval of the outstanding shares.

(e) The corporation may pay or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action or proceeding in advance of the final disposition in the manner provided in (d) of this section if

(1) in the case of a director or officer, the director or officer furnishes the corporation with a written affirmation of a good faith belief that the standard of conduct described in AS 10.06.450(b) or 10.06.483(e) has been met;

(2) the director, officer, employee, or agent furnishes the corporation a written unlimited general undertaking, executed personally or on behalf of the individual, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that an applicable standard of conduct was not met; and

(3) a determination is made that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification under this chapter.

(f) The indemnification provided by this section is not exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification may be entitled under a bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in the official capacity of the person and as to action in another capacity while holding the office. The right to indemnification continues as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent, and inures to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of the person.

(g) A corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in that capacity, or arising out of that status, whether or not the corporation has the power to indemnify the person against the liability under the provisions of this section.

###### Sec. 10.06.576.   Procedures relating to the exercise of a shareholder's right to dissent; completion of corporate action; notice of election; treatment of shares.

(a) A shareholder electing to exercise a right to dissent shall file with the corporation, before or at the meeting of shareholders at which the proposed corporate action is submitted to a vote, a written objection to the proposed corporate action. The objection must include a notice of election to dissent, the shareholder's name and residence address, the number and classes of shares as to which the shareholder dissents, and a demand for payment of the fair value of the shares if the action is taken. A shareholder to whom the corporation did not give notice of the meeting in accordance with this chapter is not required to make the objection provided in this section.

(b) Within 10 days after the shareholders' vote authorizing the action, the corporation shall given written notice of the authorization to each shareholder who filed written objection or from whom written objection was not required. The corporation may consider that a shareholder who voted for the proposed action has elected not to enforce a right of dissent under this chapter, and need not give notice to the shareholder.

(c) Within 20 days after notice has been given under (b) of this section, a shareholder from whom written objection was not required under (a) of this section and who elects to dissent shall file with the corporation a written notice of the election, stating the shareholder's name and residence address, the number and classes of shares as to which the shareholder dissents, and a demand for payment of the fair value of the shares. A shareholder who elects to dissent from a merger under AS 10.06.532, a consolidation under AS 10.06.534, a share exchange under AS 10.06.540, a transaction authorized under AS 10.06.562, or a sale of assets under AS 10.06.568 shall file a written notice of the election to dissent within 20 days after the merger plan, consolidation plan, share exchange plan, or sale of assets resolution has been mailed to the shareholder.

(d) A merger, consolidation, or exchange is considered completed within the meaning of this chapter on the effective date determined in accordance with AS 10.06.560; a transaction under AS 10.06.568 is completed within the meaning of this chapter when the corporation has received the consideration specified in the board resolution that was submitted to the shareholders in accordance with that section.

(e) Upon completion of the corporation action, the shareholder shall cease to have the rights of a shareholder except the right to be paid the fair value of the shares as to which the dissenter's rights were perfected under this chapter. A notice of election may be withdrawn by the shareholder at any time before an acceptance under AS 10.06.578(f), but in no case later than 60 days from the date of completion of the corporate action, except that the time for withdrawing a notice of election shall be extended for 60 days from the date an offer is made, if the corporation fails to make a timely offer under AS 10.06.578. After the time for withdrawal has expired, withdrawal of a notice of election requires the written consent of the corporation. In order to be effective, withdrawal of a notice of election must be accompanied by the return to the corporation of an advance payment made to the shareholder as provided in AS 10.06.578. If a notice of election is withdrawn, if the corporate action is rescinded, if a court determines that the shareholder is not entitled to the right to dissent, or if the shareholder otherwise loses the right to dissent, the shareholder shall not have the right to receive payment for the shares and shall be reinstated to all rights as a shareholder that were effective on the date of the completion of the corporate action. The rights to which the shareholder is reinstated include intervening preemptive rights and the right to payment of an intervening dividend or other distribution. If an intervening right has expired or if a dividend or distribution that is not in cash has been completed, the corporation may elect to pay the shareholder the fair value of the shares in cash at the value, as determined by the board, at the time of the expiration or completion. The election to pay the value in cash shall be without prejudice to a corporate proceeding that has occurred in the interim.

(f) At the time of filing the notice of election to dissent, or within 30 days after the shareholder has filed the notice, the shareholder shall submit to the corporation, or to its transfer agent, the certificates representing the shares for which payment is claimed, if certificates have been issued. The corporation or its transfer agent shall note conspicuously on the certificates, or on a separate document if certificates have not been issued for the shares, that a notice of election has been filed, and shall return the certificates or the separate document to the shareholder or to the person who submitted them on the shareholder's behalf. Unless a court, for good cause shown, otherwise directs, a shareholder who fails to comply with this subsection loses the right to dissent granted by this chapter, if the corporation gives written notice that the right to dissent will be lost to the shareholder within 45 days from the date that the shareholder filed the notice of election to dissent. If the corporation fails to exercise this notice option in a timely manner, the shareholder retains the right to dissent granted by this chapter.

(g) When a share of a dissenting shareholder under (f) of this section is transferred, the new certificate must bear a notation similar to that made under (f) of this section and state the name of the original dissenting holder of the shares, or, if the share is an uncertificated share, the corporation must give the transferee a written notice stating that a notice of election to dissent has been filed and giving the name of the original dissenting holder. A transferee acquires only the rights in the corporation that the original dissenting shareholder had at the time of transfer.

###### Sec. 10.06.578.   Offer and payment to dissenting shareholders; circumstances where prohibited.

(a) Within 15 days after the expiration of the period within which shareholders may file their notice of election to dissent under AS 10.06.576, or within 15 days after the proposed corporate action is completed, whichever is later, the corporation or, in the case of a merger or consolidation, the surviving or new corporation, shall make a written offer by certified mail to each shareholder who has filed the notice of election, to pay the amount the corporation estimates to be the fair value of the shares. The offer shall be made at the same price for each share to all dissenting shareholders of the same class, or if divided into series, of the same series.

(b) The offer required by (a) of this section must be accompanied by a

(1) balance sheet of the corporation whose shares the dissenting shareholder holds; the date of the balance sheet shall be that of the most recent balance sheet produced in the 12 months before the offer;

(2) profit and loss statement or statements for at least 12 months preceding the date of the balance sheet; if the corporation was not in existence during the entire 12-month period preceding the balance sheet required by (1) of this subsection, then a profit and loss statement for that portion of the 12-month period preceding the balance sheet during which the corporation was in existence;

(3) statement of the total number of shares with respect to which notices of election to dissent have been received and the total number of holders of these shares; and

(4) copy of this section and AS 10.06.580.

(c) If the corporate action has been completed the offer required by (a) of this section must also be accompanied by

(1) advance payment to each shareholder who submitted the share certificates to the corporation, or to whom notice was sent if the shares were uncertificated, as provided in AS 10.06.576(f), of the amount offered under (a) of this section; or

(2) a statement to a shareholder who has not submitted the share certificates, if certificates were issued for the shares, that advance payment of the amount offered under (a) of this section will be made by the corporation promptly upon submission of the certificates.

(d) If the corporate action has not been completed when the offer required by (a) of this section is made, the advance payment or statement about the advance payment shall be sent to each shareholder entitled to the payment or notice, after completion of the corporate action.

(e) The advance payment or statement about the advance payment shall include advice to the shareholder that acceptance of the payment does not constitute a waiver of the shareholder's right to dissent.

(f) The corporation may consider that a shareholder who fails to make written objection to the amount tendered under (c)(1) of this section or to submit shares in response to the statement sent under (c)(2) of this section within 30 days of the date the statement was mailed has agreed that the amount offered represents the fair value of the shares. The shareholder shall have no interest in the shares or the outcome of litigation begun under AS 10.06.580.

(g) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if the payments otherwise required by (c) and (d) of this section or determined in accordance with AS 10.06.580 would be distributions in violation of AS 10.06.358§10.06.365, or 10.06.375, the corporation may not make a distribution to a dissenting shareholder. In that event, a corporation that would otherwise have the payment obligation under (c) and (d) of this section or AS 10.06.580 shall, in addition to complying with (a) and (b) of this section, give written notice within the time limits of (a) and (b) of this section to dissenting shareholders of its inability to make payment. The notice must include

(1) an explanation why the corporation is unable to make the payments otherwise required by this section;

(2) a statement that a dissenting shareholder has an option to

(A) withdraw the shareholder's notice of election to dissent, and that the corporation will consider that the withdrawal was made with the written consent of the corporation; or

(B) retain the status of a dissenter, and, if the corporation is liquidated, be subordinated to the rights of the creditors of the corporation, but have rights superior to the nondissenting shareholders, but if the corporation is not liquidated, retain the right to be paid under (c) and (d) of this section or AS 10.06.580 and the corporation must satisfy the obligation when the restrictions on distributions do not apply; and

(3) a statement that if the corporation does not receive the written election provided under (2) of this subsection within 60 days after notice given as required by this section, the corporation will consider that the shareholder has withdrawn the notice of election under (2)(A) of this subsection.

###### Sec. 10.06.580.   Action to determine value of shares.

(a) If the corporation fails to make the offer required by AS 10.06.578(a) or the shareholder rejects the offer within the 30-day period specified in AS 10.06.578(f),

(1) the corporation shall, within 20 days after the expiration of the 30-day period specified in AS 10.06.578(f), file a petition in the court of the judicial district where the registered office of the corporation is located, requesting that the fair value of the shares be determined; if, in the case of a merger or consolidation, the surviving or new corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in the state, the petition shall be filed in the judicial district where the registered office of the domestic corporation was last located; or

(2) if the corporation fails to institute a proceeding as provided in this section, a dissenting shareholder may institute a proceeding in the name of the corporation; if a dissenting shareholder does not institute a proceeding within 30 days after the expiration of the 20-day period granted the corporation under (1) of this subsection, the dissenter loses the dissenter's rights unless the superior court, for good cause shown, otherwise directs.

(b) All dissenting shareholders who have rejected the corporate offer extended under AS 10.06.578(a), wherever residing, shall be made parties to the proceeding as an action against their shares quasi in rem. The corporation shall serve a copy of the complaint in the proceeding on each dissenting shareholder who is a resident of this state in the manner provided by the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure, and on each nonresident dissenting shareholder either by certified mail and publication, or in another manner permitted by law. The jurisdiction of the court shall be plenary and exclusive. A dissenting shareholder who is a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment against the corporation for the amount determined under (c) of this section to be the fair value of the shares of that shareholder.

(c) The court shall determine whether a dissenting shareholder who is a party to the court action is entitled to receive payment for the shareholder's shares. If the corporation does not request a determination, or if the court finds that a dissenting shareholder is entitled to a determination, the court shall establish the value of the shares; for the purposes of this section, the value shall be the fair value at the close of business on the day before the date on which the vote was taken approving the proposed corporate action. In fixing the fair value of the shares, the court shall consider the nature of the transaction giving rise to the right to dissent under AS 10.06.576, its effects on the corporation and its shareholders, the concepts and methods customary in the relevant securities and financial markets for determining the fair value of shares of a corporation engaging in a similar transaction under comparable circumstances, and other relevant factors. The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value of the shares. The appraisers have the power and authority specified in the order of appointment or as amended.

(d) The judgment must include an allowance for interest at the rate the court finds to be fair and equitable, from the date on which the proposed corporate action vote was taken to the date of payment. In determining the rate of interest, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including the rate of interest that the corporation would have had to pay to borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. If the court finds that the refusal of a shareholder to accept the corporate offer of payment for the shares is arbitrary, vexatious, or otherwise in bad faith, the court shall deny interest to the shareholder.

(e) A party to the proceeding shall bear its own costs and expenses, including the fees and expenses of its counsel and of any experts employed by it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the court may, in its discretion, apportion and assess all or part of the costs, expenses, and fees incurred by the corporation against one or more of the dissenting shareholders who are parties to the proceeding, if the court finds that a refusal to accept the corporate offer was arbitrary, vexatious, or otherwise in bad faith. The court may, in its discretion, apportion and assess all or a part of the costs, expenses, and fees incurred by one or more of the dissenting shareholders who are parties to the proceeding against the corporation if the court finds that

(1) the fair value of the shares materially exceeds the amount that the corporation offered to pay;

(2) an offer or required advance payment was not made by the corporation as provided in AS 10.06.578;

(3) the corporation failed to institute the special proceeding within the period specified under (a) of this section; or

(4) the action of the corporation in complying with its obligations as provided in this chapter was arbitrary, vexatious, or otherwise in bad faith.

(f) Unless prohibited by AS 10.06.578(g), within 60 days after the final determination of the proceeding, the corporation shall pay to each dissenting shareholder who is a party the amount determined under (e) of this section in exchange for the surrender of the certificate representing the dissenter's shares or the dissenter's shares if the shares are uncertificated. Upon payment of the judgment, the dissenting shareholder ceases to have an interest in the shares.

###### Sec. 10.06.582.   Status of shares acquired from dissenting shareholders.

Shares acquired by a corporation under AS 10.06.578 and 10.06.580 shall be held and disposed of by the corporation as other shares reacquired under AS 10.06.388, except that, in the case of a merger or consolidation, they shall be held and disposed of as the plan of merger or consolidation may otherwise provide.

###### Sec. 10.06.628.   Involuntary dissolution by verified complaint; filing; intervention by shareholder or creditor.

(a) A verified complaint for involuntary dissolution of a corporation on any of the grounds specified in (b) of this section may be filed in the superior court by the following persons:

(1) one-half or more of the directors in office;

(2) a shareholder or shareholders who hold shares representing not less than 331/3 percent of the total number of outstanding shares, assuming conversion of preferred shares convertible into common shares, or of the outstanding common shares, or of the equity of the corporation, exclusive of shares owned by persons who have personally participated in any of the transactions enumerated in (b)(4) of this section;

(3) a shareholder if the ground for dissolution is that the period for which the corporation was formed has terminated without extension; or

(4) another person expressly authorized to do so in the articles.

(b) The grounds for involuntary dissolution are:

(1) the corporation has abandoned its business for more than one year;

(2) the corporation has an even number of directors who are equally divided and cannot agree as to the management of its affairs, so that its business can no longer be conducted to advantage or so that there is danger that its property and business will be impaired or lost, and the holders of the voting shares of the corporation are so divided into factions that they cannot elect a board consisting of an uneven number;

(3) there is internal dissension and two or more factions of shareholders in the corporation are so deadlocked that its business can no longer be conducted with advantage to its shareholders, or the shareholders have failed at two consecutive annual meetings at which all voting power was exercised to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon election of their successors;

(4) those in control of the corporation have been guilty of or have knowingly countenanced persistent and pervasive fraud, mismanagement or abuse of authority or persistent unfairness toward shareholders, or the property of the corporation is being misapplied or wasted by its directors or officers;

(5) in the case of any corporation with 35 or fewer shareholders of record, liquidation is reasonably necessary for the protection of the rights or interests of the complaining shareholder or shareholders; or

(6) the period for which the corporation was formed has terminated without extension.

(c) Before the trial of the action a shareholder or creditor of the corporation may intervene.

(d) For purposes of this section, "shareholder" includes a beneficial owner of shares who has entered into an agreement under AS 10.06.425(a).

###### Sec. 10.06.630.   Avoiding dissolution by verified complaint; purchase of plaintiff's shares; determination of fair value; stay; appraisal; award; appeal.

(a) Subject to a contrary provision in the articles of incorporation, in a suit for involuntary dissolution under AS 10.06.628 the corporation or, if it does not elect to purchase, the holders of 50 percent or more of the voting power of the corporation, the "purchasing parties", may avoid the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of a receiver by purchasing for cash the shares owned by the plaintiffs, the "moving parties", at their fair value. The fair value shall be determined on the basis of the liquidation value, taking into account the possibility of sale of the entire business as a going concern in a liquidation. The election of the corporation to purchase may be made by the approval of the outstanding shares excluding shares held by the moving parties.

(b) If the purchasing parties elect to purchase the shares owned by the moving parties, and are unable to agree with the moving parties upon the fair value of the shares, and give bond with sufficient security to pay the estimated reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, of the moving parties if the expenses are recoverable under (c) of this section, the court upon application of the purchasing parties shall stay the winding up and dissolution proceeding and shall proceed to ascertain and fix the fair value of the shares owned by the moving parties.

(c) The court shall appoint three disinterested appraisers to appraise the fair value of the shares owned by the moving parties, and shall make an order referring the matter to the appraisers for the purpose of ascertaining the value of the shares. The order shall prescribe the time and manner of producing evidence if evidence is required. The award of the appraisers or of a majority of the appraisers, when confirmed by the court, is final and conclusive upon all parties. The court shall enter a decree that provides in the alternative for winding up and dissolution of the corporation unless payment is made for the shares within the time specified by the decree. If the purchasing parties do not make payment for the shares within the time specified, judgment shall be entered against the purchasing parties and the surety or sureties on the bond for the amount of the expenses, including attorney fees, of the moving parties. A shareholder aggrieved by the action of the court may appeal.

(d) If the purchasing parties desire to prevent the winding up and dissolution, they shall pay to the moving parties the value of their shares as provided under this section less an allowance for the costs of the appraisal as the court shall determine. In the case of an appeal, the purchasing parties shall pay to the moving parties the value of the shares and costs of appraisal as fixed on appeal. On receiving payment or the tender of payment as determined by the court, the moving parties shall transfer their shares to the purchasing parties.

(e) For the purposes of this section, "shareholder" includes a beneficial owner of shares who has entered into an agreement under AS 10.06.425(a).

###### Sec. 10.06.633.   Involuntary dissolution by the commissioner: grounds, procedure, reinstatement.

(a) A corporation may be dissolved involuntarily by the commissioner if

(1) the corporation is delinquent six months in filing its biennial report or in paying its biennial corporation tax or a penalty;

(2) the corporation has failed for 30 days to appoint and maintain a registered agent in the state;

(3) the corporation has failed for 30 days after change of its registered office or registered agent to file in the office of the commissioner a statement of the change;

(4) the corporation has failed for two years to complete dissolution under a certificate of election under AS 10.06.608 to dissolve;

(5) a vacancy on the board of the corporation is not filled within six months or the next annual meeting, whichever occurs first;

(6) a misrepresentation of material facts has been made in the application, report, affidavit, or other document submitted under this chapter; or

(7) the corporation is 90 days delinquent in filing notice of change of an officer, director, alien affiliate, or five percent shareholder, as required by this chapter.

(b) A corporation may not be dissolved under this section unless the commissioner has given the corporation written notice of its delinquency, failure, or noncompliance by mail as provided by (i) of this section. If the corporation fails, within 60 days after the requirements of (i) of this section have been satisfied, to contest the alleged neglect, omission, delinquency, or noncompliance by a written request for a hearing conducted by the office of administrative hearings (AS 44.64.010) or fails to correct the asserted neglect, omission, delinquency, or noncompliance, it may be dissolved under (d) of this section.

(c) If, following a hearing, the commissioner determines the presence of neglect, omission, delinquency, or noncompliance providing grounds for involuntary dissolution under this section, the corporation may appeal to the superior court by filing with the clerk of the court a notice of appeal setting out a copy of the notice given by the commissioner under (b) of this section together with a copy of a timely demand for a hearing by the corporation, and a copy of an affirmation by the commissioner of an intention to dissolve under (d) of this section. The matter shall be tried de novo by the superior court, and the court shall either sustain the commissioner or direct the commissioner to take action the court considers proper.

(d) If a corporation has given cause for involuntary dissolution and has failed to correct the neglect, omission, delinquency, or noncompliance as provided in this section, and there has been no order of the superior court, the commissioner shall dissolve the corporation by issuing a certificate of involuntary dissolution containing a statement that the corporation has been dissolved, the date, and the reason for which it was dissolved. The original certificate of dissolution shall be placed in the department files and a copy of it mailed to the corporation as provided by (i) of this section. Upon the issuance of the certificate of involuntary dissolution, the existence of the corporation ceases, except as otherwise provided in this section, and its name shall be available to and may be adopted by another corporation no less than six months after the dissolution.

(e) A corporation dissolved under this section may be reinstated within two years from the date of the certificate of involuntary dissolution if it is established to the satisfaction of the commissioner that in fact there was no cause for the dissolution, or if the neglect, omission, delinquency, or noncompliance resulting in dissolution has been corrected and payment made of double the amount delinquent along with the amount the corporation would have paid had it not been dissolved during the two-year period. Reinstatement may not be authorized if the name is not available for corporate use under AS 10.06.105(d) unless the corporation being reinstated amends its articles of incorporation to change its name to conform with the provisions of this chapter.

(f) Nothing in this section relieves a corporation reinstated under this section from penalty or forfeiture of its powers in a case of failure to pay subsequently accruing licenses and taxes imposed by a law of the state.

(g) An action arising out of a contract assigned by a corporation dissolved under this section may be brought in the name of the assignee. The fact of assignment and of purchase by the plaintiff shall be set out in the complaint or other process. The defense may avail itself of any defense the defense might have availed itself of in a suit upon the claim by the corporation had it not been dissolved under this section.

(h) Service of process on a corporation dissolved under this section shall be made in the same manner prescribed by law as if the corporation had not been dissolved.

(i) If the mailing of an item is required by (b) or (d) of this section, the commissioner shall first mail the item by certified mail to the corporation's registered office at the last known address of the registered office shown on the records of the commissioner. If the item mailed to the registered office is returned to the commissioner, the commissioner shall mail the item by first class mail to the registered agent of the corporation at the last known address of the registered agent shown on the records of the commissioner. If the item mailed to the registered agent is returned to the commissioner, the commissioner shall mail the item by first class mail to the president of the corporation at the last known address for the president shown on the records of the commissioner. If the name and address of the president are not shown on the records of the commissioner, the commissioner shall mail the item by first class mail to an officer shown on the records of the commissioner at the last known address shown on the records of the commissioner. If the name and address of an officer of the corporation are not shown on the records of the commissioner, the commissioner shall mail the item by first class mail to a member of the board of directors of the corporation at the last known address shown on the records of the commissioner. If the name and address of an officer or board member are not shown on the records of the commissioner, the commissioner is not required to mail the item again. If the item mailed to the president, other officer, or board member is returned to the commissioner, the commissioner is not required to mail the item again. If the address shown on the records of the commissioner for a mailing after the initial certified mailing is not different from the address for the previous mailing, the commissioner is not required to mail the item to the same address, but shall mail the item to the next required addressee whose address is different from the address for the returned mailing, and, if none of the mailings required after a returned mailing has an address that is different from the address for the returned mailing, the commissioner is not required to mail the item again. In this subsection, "item" means the notice required by (b) of this section or the certificate of involuntary dissolution under (d) of this section.

###### Sec. 10.06.635.   Commissioner's authority to bring action for involuntary dissolution; grounds; relief.

(a) In addition to other remedies provided by law, a corporation may be dissolved involuntarily by a decree of the superior court in an action filed by the commissioner when it is established that the corporation has

(1) procured its certificate of incorporation through fraud;

(2) continued to exceed or abuse the authority conferred upon it by law;

(3) seriously violated a statute regulating corporations; or

(4) violated a provision of law by an act or default that under the law is a ground for forfeiture of corporate existence.

(b) The court may order dissolution or other or partial relief as it considers just and expedient. The court also may appoint a receiver under AS 10.06.643 for winding up the affairs of the corporation or may order that the corporation be wound up by its board subject to the supervision of the court.

###### Sec. 10.06.638.   Commencement of commissioner's action; notice; default.

(a) An action for the involuntary dissolution of a corporation under AS 10.06.635 shall be commenced by the commissioner in the superior court.

(b) Summons shall issue and be served as in civil actions. If no registered agent or office is found to serve, the commissioner shall publish notice as in civil cases in a newspaper published in the judicial district where the registered office of the corporation is situated, containing a notice of the pendency of the action, the title of the court, the title of the action, and the date on or after which default may be entered. The commissioner may include in one notice the names of any number of corporations against which actions are pending in the same court.

(c) The commissioner shall mail a copy of the notice to an office of the corporation, if one is known, within 10 days after the first publication of the notice.

(d) Notice shall be published at least once each week for two successive weeks, and the first publication may begin after the summons has been returned.

(e) Unless a corporation is served with summons, a default may not be taken against the corporation earlier than 30 days after the first publication of notice.

###### Sec. 10.06.640.   Appointment of provisional director upon deadlock.

(a) If the ground for the complaint for involuntary dissolution of the corporation is a deadlock in the board as set out in AS 10.06.628(b)(2), the court may appoint a provisional director.

(b) A provisional director shall be an impartial person, who is neither a shareholder nor a creditor of the corporation, nor related according to the common law by consanguinity or affinity within the third degree to a director of the corporation or to a judge of the court by which the provisional director is appointed. A provisional director has all the rights and powers of a director until the deadlock in the board is broken or until the provisional director is removed by order of the court or by approval of the outstanding shares.

(c) Unless otherwise agreed the compensation of the provisional director shall be fixed by the court.

###### Sec. 10.06.643.   Appointment of receiver: application, hearing and notice, security, qualifications, powers, compensation.

The time in which to present claims may not be less than four nor more than six months after the first publication of notice to creditors unless it appears by affidavit that there are no claims, in which case the time may not be less than three months. If it is shown that a claimant did not receive notice because of absence from the state or other cause, the court may allow a claim to be filed or presented at any time before distribution is completed.

(b) Notice to creditors in a court-directed winding up shall be published not less than once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation, published in the judicial district in which the proceeding is pending or, if a newspaper is not published in that judicial district, in a newspaper designated by the court.

###### Sec. 10.15.075.   Manner of voting by shareholders.

AS 10.06.420 relating to voting of shares in business corporations applies to shareholders of cooperatives and shares of the capital stock of cooperatives other than membership stock.

The date shall be not more than 50 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date on which the particular action requiring the determination of shareholders is to be taken. If no record date is fixed by the bylaws, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the board of directors declaring the dividend is adopted, as the case may be, is the record date for the determination of shareholders.  When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at a meeting is made as provided in this section, the determination applies to any adjournment of that meeting.

The consideration paid for shares of membership stock recalled by the cooperative shall be the par value of the shares plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any. However, if the shares have no par value the consideration paid shall be the consideration in dollars for which the shares were issued plus accrued and unpaid dividends.  The cooperative may set off obligations to it of the holder of membership stock or other evidence of equity.

###### Sec. 10.15.105.   Limitations on acquisition, recall, exchange, or redemption.

No acquisition, recall, or redemption of stock or other evidence of equity may be made if the result would be to bring the value of the remaining assets of the cooperative below the aggregate of its indebtedness.  The articles may provide limitations on the right of a cooperative to acquire, recall, exchange, or redeem its shares or other evidences of equity.

###### Sec. 10.15.110.   Status of acquired, recalled, exchanged, or redeemed shares.

###### Sec. 10.15.120.   Meetings of members.

(a) Meetings of members may be held either inside or outside the state as provided in the bylaws.  In the absence of a bylaw provision, meetings shall be held at the principal place of business of the cooperative.

(b) An annual meeting of the members shall be held at the time or within the time provided in the bylaws.  If the bylaws do not fix a time for the meeting, the annual meeting shall be held in each calendar year at the time the board determines. Failure to hold the annual meeting at the designated time does not work a forfeiture or dissolution of the cooperative.

(c) Special member meetings may be called by the president or the board.  The secretary shall call a special meeting upon the filing of a petition stating the business to be brought before the meeting signed by not less than 10 percent of the members of the cooperative.

(c) If the bylaws of a cooperative provide for the formation of districts and the election of delegates at district meetings to represent their districts in member meetings, this representation is not considered voting by proxy.  The delegates shall cast the votes to which members represented by them are entitled on those matters not covered by mail ballots submitted to all members.

(d) If the bylaws so provide, the board may have submitted by mail ballot any question to be voted on at a member meeting, including the election of directors.  In this event the secretary shall mail to each member, along with the notice of the meeting, the ballot on each question and a voting envelope.  The ballot shall be cast in a sealed envelope authenticated by the member's signature.  A vote cast by mail shall be counted as if the member were present and voting in person.

###### Sec. 10.15.155.   Removal of directors.

A director may be removed upon a majority vote of all members voting in person at a member meeting.  Before a vote for removal may be taken, written reasons for removal of the director shall be presented at a meeting of members and the director sought to be removed shall have an opportunity to answer the reasons at that meeting.  The written statement of reasons for removal shall be filed with the minutes of the meeting.

(a) Regular or special meetings of the board may be held inside or outside the state.

(b) Regular meetings of the board may be held with or without notice as prescribed in the bylaws.  Special meetings of the board shall be held upon the notice prescribed in the bylaws. Attendance of a director at a meeting constitutes a waiver of notice of the meeting except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

(c) Unless the bylaws provide otherwise, the purpose of a meeting of the board need not be specified in the notice of the meeting.

(d) Unless a greater number is required in the bylaws, a majority of the members of the board determined pursuant to the bylaws or in the absence of a bylaw fixing the number of directors, then of the number stated in the articles constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business.

(b) Other officers may be chosen by the board.

(c) Officers have the authority and shall perform the duties the bylaws provide, or as the board determines, not inconsistent with the bylaws.  Any officer may be removed by the board whenever in its judgment the best interests of the cooperative will be served by removal.  Election or appointment of an officer does not of itself create contract rights.

###### Sec. 10.15.180.   Compensation and benefits to directors, officers, and employees.

Unless the bylaws provide otherwise,

(1) only the members of the cooperative may establish compensation or other benefits for a director, not available generally to officers and employees, for services as a director;

Whenever a notice is required to be given to a member or director of a cooperative under this chapter or under the articles or bylaws of a cooperative, a waiver of notice in writing signed by the person entitled to the notice, before or after the time stated in the notice, is equivalent to the giving of the notice.

###### Sec. 10.15.200.   Procedural requisites in action brought in right of cooperative by member or shareholder.

(a) An action may not be instituted or maintained in the right of a cooperative by a member or shareholder unless that person

(2) alleges in the complaint with particularity efforts of the person to secure from the board the action desired, that the person has either informed the cooperative or board in writing of the ultimate facts of each cause of action against each director or that the person has delivered to the cooperative or board a copy of the complaint that the person proposes to file, and states the reasons for failure of the person to obtain action or the reasons for not making the effort;

In an action brought in the right of a cooperative by fewer than three percent of the members or by holders of less than three percent of an outstanding class of stock, the defendants may require the plaintiff to give security for the reasonable expenses of defending the action, including attorney fees.

###### Sec. 10.15.250.   Effect of recording contract; subsequent interests and liens.

Recording under  AS 10.15.230 § 10.15.260 operates as a constructive notice to all persons of the existence and contents of the contract.

If the member creates a mortgage upon any products subsequent to the recording of the contract, and if the member and the mortgagee jointly notify the cooperative in writing of the existence and amount of the mortgage, all payments from the cooperative to the member which become due after the notice by reason of the cooperative's sale or other handling of the products shall be paid to the mortgagee until the amount of the mortgage has been paid, and the balance thereafter shall be paid to the member.

###### Sec. 10.15.265.   Relief against breach or threatened breach of contract and penalty for interference.

(a) In the event of a breach or threatened breach of a cooperative contract authorized by this chapter, the cooperative is entitled to an injunction to prevent the breach or a further breach, and to a decree of specific performance of the contract.

However, in no event may a quorum consist of less than one-tenth of the votes entitled to vote at a meeting. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is the act of the members, unless the vote of a greater number is required by this chapter or the articles of incorporation or the bylaws.

A director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy shall be elected or appointed for the unexpired term of the director's predecessor in office.  A directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors shall be filled by the board of directors for a term of office which continues only until the next election of directors.  In no case may a vacancy continue for longer than six months or until the next annual meeting of the members, whichever occurs first.

###### Sec. 10.20.106.   Quorum of directors.

The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present is the act of the board of directors, unless the act of a greater number is required by the articles of incorporation or the bylaws.

###### Sec. 10.20.111.   Executive committee.

If the articles of incorporation or the bylaws so provide, the board of directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the number of directors fixed by the bylaws, or, in the absence of a bylaw fixing the number of directors, the number stated in the articles of incorporation, may designate two or more directors to constitute an executive committee, which, to the extent provided in the resolution or in the articles of incorporation or the bylaws of the corporation, may exercise the authority of the board of directors in the management of the corporation.  The designation of the executive committee and the delegation of authority to it do not relieve the board of directors or any member of the board from responsibility imposed by law.

###### Sec. 10.20.116.   Place and notice of directors' meetings.

(a) Regular or special meetings of the board of directors may be held at a designated place, by remote communication, or at a designated place and by remote communication. The designated place may be inside or outside the state.

(b) Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held with or without notice as prescribed in the bylaws. Special meetings of the board of directors shall be held after the notice which shall be prescribed in the bylaws. Attendance of a director at a meeting constitutes a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  The business to be transacted or the purpose of a regular or special meeting of the board of directors need not be specified in the notice of the meeting unless required by the bylaws.

Book value shall be determined from the books and records of the corporation in accordance with the regular method of accounting used by the corporation.

(a) A person who is a manager or a managing member of a limited liability company shall perform the duties of management in good faith, in a manner the person reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the company, and with the care, including reasonable inquiry, that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. Except as provided in (b) of this section, the person is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by

(1) an employee of the company whom the person reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; or

(2) counsel, public accountants, or other professionals or experts as to matters that the person reasonably believes to be within the professional's or expert's competence.

(b) A person is not acting in good faith under (a) of this section if the person has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by (a) of this section unwarranted.

(b) The fact that a manager or managing member of a limited liability company is a manager or managing member of another entity involved in the transaction does not alone constitute a material financial interest within the meaning of this section. A manager or managing member is not interested within the meaning of this section in a decision fixing the compensation of another manager or managing member as a manager or managing member of the company, notwithstanding the fact that the first manager or managing member is also receiving compensation from the company.

(c) A contract or other transaction between a manager or managing member and a limited liability company or association of which one or more managers or managing members of the company are managers or managing members is not void or voidable because the managers or managing members are present at the meeting that authorizes, approves, or ratifies the contract or transaction, if the material facts of the transaction and the manager's or managing member's other management position are fully disclosed or known to the members and the members authorize, approve, or ratify the contract or transaction in good faith by a sufficient vote without counting the vote of the common manager or managing member or the contract or transaction is approved by the members in good faith. This subsection does not apply to contracts or transactions covered by (a) of this section.

(d) Nothing in this section affects the prohibitions or restraints imposed by AS 45.50.562§45.50.596.

###### Sec. 10.50.145.   Loans to managers, managing members, and employees.

(a) A loan may not be extended by a limited liability company to an employee without authorization by the company's managers or managing members. A loan may not be extended to a manager or a managing member of a limited liability company without the approval of two-thirds of the company's members. An employee who is also a manager or managing member is considered a manager or managing member for purposes of this section. A member is not disqualified from voting on a loan to a member as a manager or managing member because of personal interest.

(b) A loan to a manager, managing member, or employee and a loan secured by the limited liability company interests of the company may not be made unless the loan would be permissible as a distribution under AS 10.50.290§10.50.345.

(c) For purposes of this section, a loan may consist of cash, securities, or personal or real property.

(d) If a limited liability company acts as a guarantor on a loan to a manager, managing member, or employee, the guarantee is treated as a loan under this section.

(e) A manager, managing member, or employee of an affiliated limited liability company is a manager, managing member, or employee of the lending company for purposes of this section.

(f) A loan is to be judged by the duties of managers and managing members to act in good faith in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the company and with the care, including reasonable inquiry, that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.

###### Sec. 10.50.148.   Indemnification of managers, managing members, employees, and agents; insurance.

(a) A limited liability company may indemnify a person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a party to a completed, pending, or threatened action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the company, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a manager, managing member, employee, or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a manager, managing member, employee, or agent of another limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. Indemnification may include reimbursement of expenses, attorney fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the action or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company, and, with respect to a criminal action or proceeding, the person had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. The termination of an action or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company, and, with respect to a criminal action or proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.

(b) A limited liability company may indemnify a person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a party to a completed, pending, or threatened action by or in the right of the company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a manager, managing member, employee, or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a manager, managing member, employee, or agent of another limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. Indemnification may include reimbursement for expenses and attorney fees actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company. Indemnification may not be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which the person has been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of the person's duty to the company except to the extent that the court in which the action was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for expenses that the court considers proper.

(c) To the extent that a manager, managing member, employee, or agent of a limited liability company has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of an action or proceeding referred to in (a) or (b) of this section, or in defense of a claim, issue, or matter in the action or proceeding, the manager, managing member, employee, or agent shall be indemnified against expenses and attorney fees actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense.

(d) Unless otherwise ordered by a court, indemnification under (a) or (b) of this section may only be made by a company upon a determination that indemnification of the manager, managing member, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because the manager, managing member, employee, or agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set out in (a) and (b) of this section. The determination shall be made by the members.

(e) The company may pay or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action or proceeding in advance of the final disposition in the manner provided in (d) of this section if

(1) in the case of a manager or managing member, the manager or managing member furnishes the company with a written affirmation of a good faith belief that the standard of conduct described in AS 10.50.135(a) has been met;

(2) the manager, managing member, employee, or agent furnishes the company a written unlimited general undertaking, executed personally or on behalf of the individual, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that an applicable standard of conduct was not met; and

(3) a determination is made that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification under this chapter.

(f) The indemnification provided by this section is not exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification may be entitled. The right to indemnification continues as to a person who has ceased to be a manager, managing member, employee, or agent, and inures to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of the person.

(g) A limited liability company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a person who is or was a manager, managing member, employee, or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a manager, managing member, employee, or agent of another limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in that capacity, or arising out of that status, whether or not the company has the power to indemnify the person against the liability under the provisions of this section.

###### Sec. 10.50.150.   Authorization of company affairs.

(a) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement of the company, the company's articles of organization, or by this chapter, if the company is not managed by a manager, the consent of more than one-half of all of the members of a limited liability company is required to decide the affairs of the company.

(c) Notwithstanding (a) and (b) of this section, and unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement of the company or in the company's articles of organization, the written consent of all of the members of a limited liability company is required to

(1) amend the articles of organization;

(2) amend an operating agreement of the company; or

(3) authorize a manager or member to perform an act on behalf of the company that contravenes an operating agreement of the company, including an act that contravenes a provision of the operating agreement that expressly limits the purposes, affairs, or conduct of the affairs of the company.
