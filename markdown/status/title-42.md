The commission may authorize temporary suspension of a service or of part of a service.

(b) Upon complaint or upon its own motion, the commission may reinvestigate a previously authorized discontinuance, abandonment, or suspension of a service of an operating public utility.

The public utility shall clearly print, or type, its complete tariff and keep an up-to-date copy of it on file at its principal business office and at a designated place in each community served.  The tariffs shall be made available to, and subject to inspection by, the general public on demand.

(b) The tariffs of a public utility which are also subject to the jurisdiction of a federal regulatory body shall correspond, so far as practicable, to the form of those prescribed by the federal regulatory body.

(c) The commission may reject the filing of all or part of a tariff that does not comply with the form or filing regulations of the commission.  A tariff or provision so rejected is void.  If the commission rejects a filing, it shall issue a statement of the reasons for the rejection. Unless the utility and the commission agree to an extension of time, the commission may not reject a filing under this subsection after 45 days have elapsed from the date of filing.

###### Sec. 42.05.370.   [Repealed,§5 ch 113 SLA 1970.]

###### Sec. 42.05.371.   Adherence to tariffs.

The terms and conditions under which a public utility offers its services and facilities to the public shall be governed strictly by the provisions of its currently effective tariffs.  A legally filed and effective tariff rate, charge, toll, rental, rule, regulation, or condition of service may not be changed except in the manner provided in this chapter.  If more than one tariff rate or charge can reasonably be applied for billing purposes the one most advantageous to the customer shall be used.

###### Sec. 42.05.380.   [Repealed,§5 ch 113 SLA 1970.]

###### Sec. 42.05.381.   Rates to be just and reasonable.

(a) All rates demanded or received by a public utility, or by any two or more public utilities jointly, for a service furnished or to be furnished shall be just and reasonable; however, a rate may not include an allowance for costs of political contributions, or public relations except for reasonable amounts spent for

(1) energy conservation efforts;

(2) public information designed to promote more efficient use of the utility's facilities or services or to protect the physical plant of the utility;

(3) informing shareholders and members of a cooperative of meetings of the utility and encouraging attendance; or

(4) emergency situations to the extent and under the circumstances authorized by the commission for good cause shown.

(b) In establishing the revenue requirements of a municipally owned and operated utility the municipality is entitled to include a reasonable rate of return.

(c) A utility, whether subject to regulation by the commission or exempt from regulation, may not charge a fee for connection to, disconnection from, or transfer of services in an amount in excess of the actual cost to the utility of performing the service plus a profit at a reasonable percentage of that cost not to exceed the percentage established by the commission by regulation.

(d) A utility shall provide for a reduced fee or surcharge for standby water for fire protection systems approved under  AS 18.70.081 which use hydraulic sprinklers.

(e) The commission shall adopt regulations for electric cooperatives and for local exchange telephone utilities setting a range for adjustment of rates by a simplified rate filing procedure. A cooperative or telephone utility may apply for permission to adjust its rates over a period of time under the simplified rate filing procedure regulations. The commission shall grant the application if the cooperative or telephone utility satisfies the requirements of the regulations. The commission may review implementation of the simplified rate filing procedure at reasonable intervals and may revoke permission to use the procedure or require modification of the rates to correct an error.

(f) A local exchange telephone utility may adjust its rates in conformance with changes in jurisdictional cost allocation factors required by either the Federal Communications Commission or the Regulatory Commission of Alaska upon a showing to the Regulatory Commission of Alaska of

(1) the order requiring the change in allocation factors;

(2) the aggregate shift in revenue requirement, segregated by service classes or categories, caused by the change in allocation factors; and

(3) the rate adjustment required to conform to the required shift in local revenue requirement.

(g) The commission shall allow, as a necessary and reasonable expense, all payments made to the Department of Environmental Conservation under  AS 46.14.240§ 46.14.250. The commission shall allow the public utility to recover these fees through a periodic fuel surcharge rate adjustment.

(h) An electric or telephone utility that has overhead utility distribution lines and that provides services in a municipality with a population of more than 200,000 must spend at least one percent of the utility's annual gross revenue from retail customers in that municipality to place existing overhead utility distribution lines in that municipality underground. In determining the annual gross revenue under this subsection, only revenue derived from the utility's distribution lines in the municipality shall be considered.

(i) An electric or telephone utility that is implementing a program to place existing overhead utility distribution lines located in a municipality underground may amend its rates for services provided to customers in the municipality to enable the utility to recover the full actual cost of placing the lines underground. Notwithstanding  AS 42.05.411§ 42.05.431, an amendment to a utility's rates under this subsection is not subject to commission review or approval. A utility amending its rates under this subsection shall notify the commission of the amendment. This subsection applies to an undergrounding program to the extent that the costs do not exceed two percent of the utility's annual gross revenue. If an undergrounding program's costs exceed two percent, the commission may regulate rate increases proposed for the recovery of the amount above two percent.

(j) When an electric utility or a telephone utility is implementing a program to place existing overhead utility distribution lines located in a municipality underground, any other overhead line or cable in the same location shall be placed underground at the same time. Each entity whose lines or cables are placed underground shall pay the cost of placing its own lines or cables underground.

(k) The cost to the utility of storing gas in a gas storage facility or storing liquefied natural gas in a liquefied natural gas storage facility that is allowed in determining a just and reasonable rate shall reflect the reduction in cost attributable to any exemption from a payment due under  AS 38.05.096 or  38.05.180(u), as applicable, and the value of a tax credit that the owner of the gas storage facility received under  AS 43.20.046 or  43.20.047, as applicable. The commission may request the (1) commissioner of natural resources to report the value of the exemption from a payment due under  AS 38.05.096 or  38.05.180(u), as applicable, that the gas storage facility received; and (2) commissioner of revenue to report information on the amount of tax credits claimed under  AS 43.20.046 and  43.20.047, as applicable, for the gas storage facility or liquefied natural gas storage facility. In this subsection, "gas storage facility" has the meaning given in  AS 31.05.032.

(l) The rates and terms and conditions of service of an incumbent local exchange carrier for basic residential local telephone service must be uniform within the carrier's study area, as determined by the Federal Communications Commission.

(m) The rates and terms and conditions of service of a competitive local exchange carrier for basic residential local telephone service must be uniform throughout the carrier's service area.

(n) The retail rates of a long distance telephone company for message telephone service for residential customers must be geographically averaged. If rates vary by distance over which calls are placed, the rate for each mileage band must be equal to or greater than the rate for the next shorter mileage band.

(o) In this section, "local exchange carrier" and "long distance telephone company" have the meanings given in AS 42.05.890.

###### Sec. 42.05.385.   Charges for water and sewer line extensions.

(a) A water or sewer line extension may not be constructed unless the legislative body of each municipality through which the extension passes has approved the extension. This subsection does not apply to an extension that will not create any charges or assessments against the adjacent property.

(b) Except as provided in (e) of this section, when utility service is available to a property owner as a result of a water or sewer line extension, the utility offering the service through the extension shall notify the property owner, according to the procedure set forth for service of process in the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure, of the charges and interest due the utility if the property owner elects to obtain the utility service through the extension. The property owner does not owe the charge for the extension until the property owner connects to the extension.

(c) Except as provided in (e) of this section, and unless the property owner connects to the extension,

(1) charges do not accrue against the property for construction of the extension;

(2) interest does not accrue against the property for the construction of the extension; and

(3) a lien or encumbrance may not be levied against the property for the construction of the extension.

(d) If the costs of constructing a water or sewer line extension have been paid by charges collected under this chapter, a utility may not charge for connection to the extension an amount greater than the actual cost of the connection.

(e) The provisions of this section do not apply to a water or sewer line extension constructed by a municipality under AS 29.46.

###### Sec. 42.05.390.   [Repealed,§5 ch 113 SLA 1970.]

###### Sec. 42.05.391.   Discrimination in rates.

(a) Except as provided in AS 42.05.306, a public utility may not, as to rates, grant an unreasonable preference or advantage to any of its customers or subject a customer to an unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage. A public utility may not establish or maintain an unreasonable difference as to rates, either as between localities or between classes of service. A municipally owned utility may offer uniform or identical rates for a public utility service to customers located in different areas within its certificated service area who receive the same class of service. Any uniform or identical rate shall, upon complaint, be subject to review by the commission and may be set aside if shown to be unreasonable.

(b) A rate charged by a municipality for a public utility service furnished beyond its corporate limits is not considered unjustly discriminatory solely because a different rate is charged for a similar service within its corporate limits.

(c) A public utility may not directly or indirectly refund, rebate or remit in any manner, or by any device, any portion of the rates and charges or charge, demand, or receive a greater or lesser compensation for its services than is specified in its effective tariff.  A public utility may not extend to any customer any form of contract, agreement, inducement, privilege, or facility, or apply any rule, regulation, or condition of service except such as are extended or applied to all customers under like circumstances.  A public utility may not offer or pay any compensation or consideration or furnish any equipment to secure the installation or adoption of the use of utility service unless it conforms to a tariff approved by the commission, and the compensation, consideration, or equipment is offered to all persons in the same classification using or applying for the public utility service; in determining the reasonableness of such a tariff filed by a public utility the commission shall consider, among other things, evidence of consideration or compensation paid by a competitor, regulated or nonregulated, of the public utility to secure the installation or adoption of the use of the competitor's service.

(d) Nothing in this section prevents a public utility from charging reduced rates to customers transferred to it from a competing utility provided the reduction is an integral part of a contract, arrangement, or plan to eliminate the overlapping of service areas or to minimize duplication of facilities and competition between public utilities.

###### Sec. 42.05.400.   [Repealed,§5 ch 113 SLA 1970.]

###### Sec. 42.05.401.   Apportionment of joint rates.

(a) If public utilities share in a joint rate the apportionment of receipts shall be just and reasonable.  The method of apportionment shall be approved by the commission and the commission may, if it considers it to be in the public interest, establish the portion to which each public utility shall be entitled.

(b) If the commission does not have professional staff to investigate, evaluate, and testify regarding any proceeding under (a) of this section it may employ qualified professional consultants for this purpose at the direct expense of the parties to the dispute and divide the cost among the parties in the proportion of their respective operating revenues before commencement of the proceeding.  The cost allocation to each party shall be determined before employment of the consultants and after giving the parties reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard.

###### Sec. 42.05.410.   [Repealed,§5 ch 113 SLA 1970.]

###### Sec. 42.05.411.   New or revised tariffs.

(a) A public utility may not establish or place in effect any new or revised rates, charges, rules, regulations, conditions of service or practices except after 45 days' notice to the commission and 30 days' notice to the public.  Notice shall be given to the commission by filing with the commission and keeping open for public inspection the revised tariff provisions which shall plainly indicate the changes to be made in the schedules then in force and the time when the changes will go into effect.  The commission shall prescribe means by regulation whereby notice is given to the public before or no later than 15 days after the filing that is reasonably adequate to notify customers affected by the filing.  The commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes to take effect on less than 45 days' notice to the commission or 30 days' notice to the public under conditions the commission prescribes.

(b) New and revised tariffs shall be filed in the manner provided in AS 42.05.361(a).

(c) Upon the filing of a new or revised tariff, the commission upon complaint or upon its own motion, without notice, may initiate an investigation of the reasonableness and lawfulness of the change.

###### Sec. 42.05.420.   [Repealed,§5 ch 113 SLA 1970.]

###### Sec. 42.05.421.   Suspension of tariff filing.

(a) When a tariff filing is made containing a new or revised rate, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or condition of service the commission may, either upon written complaint or upon its own motion, after reasonable notice, conduct a hearing to determine the reasonableness and propriety of the filing.  Pending the hearing the commission may, by order stating the reasons for its action, suspend the operation of the tariff filing. For a tariff filing that does not change the utility's revenue requirement or rate design, the suspension may last for a period not longer than six months beyond the effective date established in the tariff filing unless the commission extends the period for good cause.  For a tariff filing that changes the utility's revenue requirement or rate design, the suspension may last, unless the commission extends the period for good cause, for a period not longer than

(1) six months before an interim rate equal to the requested rate goes into effect and not longer than 12 months before a permanent rate goes into effect if the annual gross revenues of the utility making the filing are more than $3,000,000; and

(2) 150 days before an interim rate equal to the requested new rate goes into effect and not longer than one year before a permanent rate goes into effect if the annual gross revenues of the utility making the filing are $3,000,000 or less.

(b) An order suspending a tariff filing may be vacated if, after investigation, the commission finds that it is in all respects proper.  Otherwise the commission shall hold a hearing on the suspended filing and issue its order, before the end of the suspension period, granting, denying or modifying the suspended tariff in whole or in part.

(c) In the case of a proposed increased rate, the commission may by order require the interested public utility or utilities to place in escrow in a financial institution approved by the commission and keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the increase, specifying by whom and in whose behalf the amounts are paid.  Upon completion of the hearing and decision the commission may by order require the public utility to refund to the persons in whose behalf the amounts were paid, that portion of the increased rates which was found to be unreasonable or unlawful.  Funds may not be released from escrow without the commission's prior written consent and the escrow agent shall be so instructed by the utility, in writing, with a copy to the commission.  The utility may, at its expense, substitute a bond in lieu of the escrow requirement.

(d) One who initiates a change in existing tariffs shall bear the burden to prove the reasonableness of the change.

###### Sec. 42.05.430.   [Repealed,§5 ch 113 SLA 1970.]

###### Sec. 42.05.431.   Power of commission to fix rates.

(a) When the commission, after an investigation and hearing, finds that a rate demanded, observed, charged, or collected by a public utility for a service subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, or that a classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract affecting the rate, is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, the commission shall determine a just and reasonable rate, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract to be observed or allowed and shall establish it by order.  A municipality may covenant with bond purchasers regarding rates of a municipally owned utility, and the covenant is valid and enforceable and is considered to be a contract with the holders from time to time of the bonds.  The financial covenants contained in mortgages and other debt instruments of cooperative utilities organized under AS 10.25 are also valid and enforceable, and rates set by the commission must be adequate to meet those covenants.  However, a cooperative utility that is negotiating to enter a mortgage or other debt instrument that provides for a times-interest-earned ratio (TIER) greater than the ratio the commission most recently approved for that cooperative shall submit the mortgage or debt instrument to the commission before the instrument takes effect.  The commission may disapprove the instrument within 60 days after its submission.  If the commission has not acted within 60 days, the instrument is considered to be approved.

(b) A wholesale power agreement between public utilities is subject to advance approval of the commission.  After a wholesale power agreement is in effect, the commission may not invalidate any purchase or sale obligation under the agreement.  However, if the commission finds that rates set in accordance with the agreement are not just and reasonable, the commission may order the parties to negotiate an amendment to the agreement and if the parties fail to agree, to use the dispute resolution procedures contained in the contract.

(c) Notwithstanding (b) of this section,

(1) a wholesale agreement for the sale of power from a project licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on or before January 1, 1987, and related contracts for the wheeling, storage, regeneration, or wholesale repurchase of power purchased under the agreement, entered into between the Alaska Energy Authority and one or more other public utilities or among the utilities after October 31, 1987, and before January 1, 1988, and amendments to the wholesale agreement or related contract, and the wholesale agreement or related contract assigned by the Alaska Energy Authority to a joint action agency formed under AS 42.45.310 that purchases the project from the Alaska Energy Authority, are not subject to review or approval by the commission until all long-term debt incurred for the project is retired, or, for a wholesale agreement or related contract assigned to a joint action agency formed under AS 42.45.310, until all long-term debt incurred to pay the purchase price to the Alaska Energy Authority is retired; and

(2) a wholesale agreement or related contract described in (1) of this subsection may contain a covenant for the public utility to establish, charge, and collect rates sufficient to meet its obligations under the contract; the rate covenant is valid and enforceable.

(d) Meetings between the Alaska Energy Authority and public utilities concerning a wholesale agreement for the sale of power or other matter exempted from review of the commission under (c) of this section must comply with AS 44.62.310.

(e) Validated costs incurred by a utility in connection with the related contracts described in (c)(1) of this section must be allowed in the rates charged by the utility. In this subsection, "validated costs" are the actual costs that a utility uses, under the formula set out in related contracts described in (c) of this section, to establish rates, charges for services and rights, and the payment of charges for services and rights. This subsection does not grant the commission jurisdiction to alter or amend the formula set out in those related contracts.

(f) In the establishment of rates of a utility furnishing solid waste material collection and disposal service, the commission shall permit recovery of reasonable, net capital and operating costs relating to solid waste recovery and recycling services after considering the utility's recovery of revenue associated with the service.

(g) In the establishment of rates under this chapter, the commission shall promote cost-effective solid waste recovery and recycling services.

(h) When setting or reviewing rates for a public utility that sends or receives power over the power transmission interties between Fairbanks and Healy or between Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula, the commission shall consider those costs that have not been directly assigned to other individual generating utilities by the utility responsible for the construction of the intertie to have been incurred for the system existing on August 11, 1993.

###### Sec. 42.05.433.   Review of certain contracts by the commission.

The commission may make revaluations from time to time and ascertain the fair value of all new construction, extensions, and additions to the property of a public utility. If a public utility furnishes more than one classification of utility service the utility shall allocate the investment and expenses associated with the property used and useful in furnishing service among the utility services and it may not solely consider the utility's total investment and expenses in fixing rates for a particular service.

(c) For rate-making purposes, indebtedness, debt service, and payments by a regulated public utility to a person having an ownership interest of more than 70 percent in the utility shall be considered to be ownership equity, profits, or dividends except to the extent that there is a clear and convincing showing that

(1) the indebtedness was incurred, or the payments made, for goods or services that were reasonably necessary for the operation of the utility; and

(2) the goods or services were provided at a cost that was competitive with the price at which they could have been obtained from a person having no ownership interest.

###### Sec. 42.06.220.   Annual report.

The commission shall, by November 15 of each year, publish an annual report reviewing its activities during the previous fiscal year and notify the legislature that the report is available. The report must address the regulation of oil and gas pipeline facilities in the state as of June 30 and must contain details about the commission's compliance with performance measures reported by the commission.

###### Sec. 42.06.230.   Jurisdiction of commission.

(a) Except as to jurisdiction of the Department of Law as provided by AS 42.06.140(a)(10), the jurisdiction and authority over the subject matter of this chapter is exclusively in the commission. To the extent that the performance of any duties of the commission affects a pipeline carrier or a pipeline subject to regulation under federal law, the performance of its duties may not, as to that pipeline carrier or pipeline, conflict with applicable federal laws, regulations, orders, or other requirements.

(b) The commission's jurisdiction and authority extend to

(1) an oil or gas pipeline facility operating in a municipality, whether home rule or otherwise; if a conflict between a certificate, order, decision, or regulation of the commission and a charter, permit, franchise, ordinance, rule, or regulation of such a local governmental entity occurs, the certificate, order, decision, or regulation of the commission prevails; and

(2) the intrastate transportation of North Slope natural gas through a North Slope natural gas pipeline.

#### Article 2. Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.

###### Sec. 42.06.240.   Certificate required; special requirements for North Slope natural gas.

(a) After January 1, 1974 a pipeline carrier, or person that will be a pipeline carrier upon completion of any proposed construction or extension, may not engage in the transportation of oil or gas by pipeline subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, or undertake the construction or extension of any pipeline facilities for that purpose, or acquire or operate any pipeline facilities or extension, unless there is in force with respect to that pipeline carrier a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the commission authorizing those acts or operations.  A certificate shall describe the nature and extent of the authority granted in it, including, as appropriate for the services involved, a description of the authorized area and scope of operation of the oil or gas pipeline facility.

(b) If any person or predecessor in interest was engaged in transportation of oil or gas by pipeline or construction of an oil or gas pipeline on or before January 1, 1974, the commission shall issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity for that pipeline without hearings or proceedings. For purposes of this section, "construction" includes application for a federal right-of-way permit.

(c) In an area where the commission determines that two or more oil or gas pipelines facilities are competing or are planning to compete to offer identical oil or gas pipeline service, and this competition is not in the public interest, the commission shall take appropriate action to eliminate or not allow the competition and undesirable duplication of facilities.

(d) The commission may attach to certificates of convenience and necessity terms and conditions and require issuance of securities it considers necessary for the protection of the environment and for the best interest of the oil or gas pipeline facility and the general public.

(e) The requirement for a certificate does not operate to impose state regulation that has been preempted under federal law. When federal law has preempted state regulation the commission shall accept the findings made under the federal scheme of regulation.

(f) In addition to other requirements of (a)§(e) of this section, the provisions of this subsection apply to a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a North Slope natural gas pipeline carrier or person that will be a North Slope natural gas pipeline carrier under this chapter:

(1) the person making application shall dedicate a portion of the pipeline's initial capacity sufficient to transport the total volume of North Slope natural gas that has been committed by producers and shippers of North Slope natural gas to tendering for intrastate firm transportation service at the time that the operation of the North Slope natural gas pipeline commences;

(2) upon receipt of the certificate application under this subsection, the commission shall issue a public notice inviting prospective intrastate shippers of North Slope natural gas to file requests for service; a request for service submitted by a shipper in response to a notice issued under this paragraph must include a proof of the shipper's commitment to use the North Slope natural gas pipeline for intrastate firm transportation service, specifying the volume of North Slope natural gas that the shipper will tender for initial intrastate firm transportation service;

(3) in its review of an application submitted under this subsection,

(A) for purposes of evaluating the total volume of intrastate transportation of North Slope natural gas to be accepted for initial intrastate transportation, the commission shall determine total volume based upon written commitments to tender North Slope natural gas for intrastate firm transportation service continuously for a period of not less than three years after the operation of the North Slope natural gas pipeline commences as follows:

(i) each request for service by an intrastate shipper that is a public utility, as that term is defined in AS 42.05.990, for the purpose of furnishing natural gas for ultimate consumption within the state by its customers that individually consume an average annual volume of less than 20,000,000 standard cubic feet of gas per day shall be supported by a written commitment by the public utility that sets out the utility's best current estimate of the average annual volume that the utility will require during the three-year period;

(ii) each request for service by an intrastate shipper that is not a public utility, as that term is defined in AS 42.05.990, and each request for service by a public utility for the purpose of furnishing natural gas for ultimate consumption within the state by a customer that individually consumes an average annual volume of 20,000,000 or more standard cubic feet of gas per day, that purchases North Slope natural gas from a North Slope natural gas producer, must be supported by one or more contracts for the purchase of the North Slope natural gas on a take-or-pay basis that extends for a period of not less than three years after the operation of the North Slope natural gas pipeline commences;

(iii) the commission may consider peak volumes specified in the written commitments of North Slope natural gas producers and purchase contracts; and

(B) the commission shall set out in its order granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity the total volume of intrastate North Slope natural gas that the North Slope natural gas pipeline carrier shall accept for intrastate transportation; the total volume may not exceed the volume substantiated by written commitments and contracts that comply with the requirements of this chapter;

(4) if the North Slope natural gas pipeline carrier wants to transport North Slope natural gas within the state in excess of the amount set out in the statement of total volume in the pipeline carrier's certificate of public convenience and necessity, the pipeline carrier may apply for authority to transport a greater volume of North Slope natural gas within the state than the carrier is required by the commission to transport in its order entered under (3)(B) of this subsection; the commission shall grant the authority requested by the pipeline carrier if the commission determines that the pipeline carrier's transportation of a greater volume is consistent with public convenience and necessity.

###### Sec. 42.06.245.   Federally regulated carriers.

The requirements of this chapter pertaining to permits and certificates of public convenience and necessity do not apply to the construction of a pipeline facility exclusively subject to federal jurisdiction or to the interstate portion of the business of a pipeline or pipeline carrier exclusively subject to federal jurisdiction. However, the requirements of this chapter for permits and certificates of public convenience and necessity do apply to all the intrastate portion of the business of a pipeline or pipeline carrier subject to federal jurisdiction whenever it engages in intrastate commerce. However, nothing limits the powers of the commission set out in this chapter except to the extent they are preempted by federal law.

###### Sec. 42.06.250.   Application.

Application for a certificate shall be made in writing to the commission, verified under oath. The commission, by regulation, shall establish the requirements for the form of the application, and the information to be contained in it. Notice of the application shall be served upon the interested parties in the manner that the commission by regulation requires.

###### Sec. 42.06.260.   Public hearings.

At least 30 days before issuing a certificate of convenience and necessity, the commission shall hold a public hearing on the application. Copies of the completed application shall be made available to the public at least 10 days before the public hearing date.  A transcript of the public hearing shall be included in the permanent record of agency action on that application, and copies of the public hearing transcripts shall be available to the public.  The commission may, without notice of hearing and pending the determination of an application for a certificate, issue a temporary certificate in cases of emergency, to assure maintenance of adequate service or to serve particular customers, and may by regulation exempt from the requirements of this section temporary acts or operations for which the issuance of a certificate will not be required in the public interest.

###### Sec. 42.06.270.   Grant or denial of application.

(a) Unless governed by AS 42.06.240(b), a certificate shall be issued to a qualified applicant, authorizing the whole or any part of the operation, service, construction, extension, or acquisition covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is able and willing properly to do the acts and to perform the service proposed and to conform to the provisions of this chapter and the requirements and regulations of the commission, and that the proposed service, operation, construction, extension, or acquisition, to the extent authorized by the certificate, is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity; otherwise the application shall be denied.

(b) The commission, after a hearing upon its own motion or upon application, may determine the gathering areas, or the routes over which, the fixed termini between which, and the intermediate and off route points, if any, to which each authorization under this section is to be limited.

(c) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as a limitation upon the power of the commission to grant certificates of public convenience and necessity for service of an area, or routes, already being served by another pipeline.

###### Sec. 42.06.280.   Insurance and security.

The commission may require a lessee to procure and furnish liability and property damage insurance from a company licensed to do business in the state or furnish other security or undertaking upon the terms and conditions the commission considers necessary if the commission finds that the net assets of the lessee are insufficient to protect the public from damage for which the lessee may be liable arising out of the construction or operation of the pipeline.

###### Sec. 42.06.285.   Pipeline carrier regulatory cost charge. [Repealed,§36 ch 2 FSSLA 1992.]

(a) A pipeline carrier operating in the state shall pay to the commission an annual regulatory cost charge in an amount not to exceed the sum of the following percentages of gross revenue derived from operations in the state: (1) not more than .7 percent to fund the operations of the commission, and (2) not more than .17 percent to fund operations of the public advocacy function under AS 42.04.070(c) and AS 44.23.020(e) within the Department of Law. A regulatory cost charge may not be assessed on pipeline carrier operations unless the operations are within the jurisdiction of the commission.

(b) The commission shall by regulation establish a method to determine annually the amount of the regulatory cost charge. If the amount the commission expects to collect under (a) of this section and under AS 42.05.254(a) exceeds the authorized budgets of the commission and the Department of Law public advocacy function under AS 42.04.070(c) and AS 44.23.020(e), the commission shall, by order, reduce the percentage determined under (e) of this section so that the total amount of the fees collected approximately equals the authorized budgets of the commission and the Department of Law public advocacy function under AS 42.04.070(c) and AS 44.23.020(e) for the fiscal year.

(c) The commission shall administer the charge imposed under this section. The Department of Revenue shall collect and enforce the charge imposed under this section. The Department of Administration shall identify the amount of the operating budgets of the commission and the Department of Law public advocacy function under AS 42.04.070(c) and AS 44.23.020(e) that lapse into the general fund each year. The legislature may appropriate an amount equal to the lapsed amount to the commission and to the Department of Law public advocacy function under AS 42.04.070(c) and AS 44.23.020(e) for operating costs for the next fiscal year. If the legislature does so, the commission shall reduce the total regulatory cost charge collected for that fiscal year by a comparable amount.

(d) The commission may adopt regulations under AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) necessary to administer this section, including requirements and procedures for reporting information and making quarterly payments. The Department of Revenue may adopt regulations under AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) for investigating the accuracy of filed information, and for collecting required payments.

(e) The commission shall by regulation establish a method to determine annually the maximum percentage of gross revenue that will apply to each regulated public utility sector, the certificated telecommunications utility sector, and the regulated pipeline carrier sector in accordance with AS 42.05.254(h).

(f) In this section, "gross revenue" means the total intrastate operating revenue as shown in a pipeline carrier's annual report required by the commission by regulation.

###### Sec. 42.06.290.   Abandonment; discontinuance, and suspension of service.

(a) A pipeline carrier may not abandon or permanently discontinue use of all or any portion of a pipeline or abandon or discontinue any service rendered by means of a pipeline that is the subject of a certificate of convenience and necessity, without the permission and approval of the commission, after due notice and hearing, and a finding by the commission that continued service is not required by public convenience and necessity.  Any interested person may file with the commission a protest or memorandum of opposition to or in support of discontinuance or abandonment.  The commission may authorize temporary suspension of a service or of part of a service.

(b) Upon complaint or upon its own motion, the commission may reinvestigate a previously authorized discontinuance, abandonment, or suspension of a service described in (a) of this section.  If, after due notice and hearing, the commission finds that the public convenience and necessity requires the service to be resumed, and that there has not been detrimental reliance on the previous authorization, it may order the operator or owner of the oil or gas pipeline facility to again provide the service.

###### Sec. 42.06.300.   Modification, suspension, or revocation of certificates.

Upon complaint or upon its own motion the commission, after due notice and hearing and for good cause shown, may amend, modify, suspend, or revoke a certificate, in whole or in part.  Good cause for amendment, modification, suspension, or revocation of a certificate shall be

(1) the requirements of public convenience and necessity;

(2) misrepresentation of a material fact in obtaining the certificate;

(3) unauthorized discontinuance or abandonment of all or part of a service that is the subject of the certificate;

(4) wilful failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or the regulations or orders of the commission; or

(5) wilful failure to comply with a term, condition, or limitation of the certificate.

###### Sec. 42.06.305.   Transfer of operating authority.

(a) Operating authority may not be transferred by sale or lease of the certificate or by the sale of substantially all of the stock or assets of a pipeline carrier holding a certificate without the prior approval of the commission.  A transfer not involving a substantial change in ownership shall be summarily approved.

(b) The commission's decision under this section shall be based on the best interest of the public.

#### Article 3. Services and Facilities.

###### Sec. 42.06.310.   Standards of service and facilities.

(a) Each oil or gas pipeline facility shall furnish and maintain adequate, efficient, and safe service and facilities. This service shall be reasonably continuous and without unreasonable interruption or delay.

(b) If the commission, upon its own motion or upon complaint, after providing reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, finds that the service or facilities of an oil or gas pipeline facility are unreasonable, unsafe, inadequate, insufficient, or unreasonably discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of this chapter, the commission shall prescribe by regulation or order, the reasonable, safe, adequate, sufficient service or facilities to be observed, furnished, enforced, or employed, including all repairs, changes, alterations, extensions, substitutions, or improvements in facilities that are reasonably necessary and proper for the safety, accommodation, and convenience of the public and the users.  Regulations or orders issued under this subsection shall conform to accepted industry standards and practices.

(c) Every common carrier shall, when ordered by the commission, extend or enlarge its pipeline or storage facilities provided the extension or enlargement shall be found to be reasonable and required in the public interest and that the expense involved will not impair the ability of the common carrier or public utility to perform its duty to the public.

(d) The requirement of (c) of this section does not apply to a North Slope natural gas pipeline carrier to the extent that the capacity of the carrier's North Slope natural gas pipeline does not allow for expanded capacity, and does not apply to require a North Slope natural gas pipeline carrier to enlarge or extend its North Slope natural gas pipeline system. However, the commission may require a North Slope natural gas pipeline carrier to expand, enlarge, or extend its North Slope natural gas pipeline system if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the commission determines that

(1) a person making a request for expanded, enlarged, or extended service by a North Slope natural gas pipeline carrier has made a firm contractual commitment to the North Slope natural gas pipeline carrier to transport North Slope natural gas; and

(2) the expansion, enlargement, or extension will not result in

(A) substantial injury, including economic injury, to the North Slope natural gas pipeline facility or its customers;

(B) substantial detriment to the services furnished by the North Slope natural gas pipeline facility; or

(C) the creation of safety hazards.

###### Sec. 42.06.320.   Discrimination in service.

An oil or gas pipeline carrier may not, as to service, make or grant an unreasonable preference or advantage to any person or subject any person to an unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage. An oil or gas pipeline facility that is owned by more than one owner may not require that users make separate requests of each separate owner in order to obtain a reasonable share of the service provided by the oil or gas pipeline facility.

###### Sec. 42.06.330.   Power of commission to allocate usage.

If the commission, upon its own motion or upon complaint, after providing reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, finds that an oil or gas pipeline facility is making or granting an unreasonable preference or advantage to any person or subjecting any person to an unreasonable prejudice or discrimination, the commission may prescribe rules to end the discrimination or the commission may itself prescribe the allocation of the service until it determines the discrimination can be avoided by appropriate rule or agreement.

###### Sec. 42.06.340.   Order for joint use or connection.

(a) When there is failure to agree upon the joint use or interconnection of oil or gas pipeline facilities or the conditions or compensation for joint use or interconnections, any interested person may apply to the commission for an order requiring the interconnection.  If, after investigation and opportunity for hearing, the commission finds that public convenience and necessity require the joint use or connection, and that the use or connection will not result in substantial injury to the oil or gas pipeline facility or its customers, or in substantial detriment to the services furnished by the oil or gas pipeline facility, or in the creation of safety hazards, it shall

(1) order that the use be permitted;

(2) prescribe reasonable conditions and compensation for the joint use;

(3) order the interconnection to be made;

(4) determine the time and manner of the interconnection;

(5) determine the apportionment of costs and responsibility for operation and maintenance of the interconnection.

(b) During construction of a pipeline, the commission, after investigation and opportunity for hearing and findings as required in (a) of this section, may order the inclusion, within the pipeline at points that it designates, of special fittings including tees, wyes, spools, reducers, enlargers, flanges, flange plates, valves, and valve boxes, to reduce the time and cost of future connections for the injection and removal of gas and oil from the main pipeline, and to maintain and facilitate intrastate commerce. A request for special fittings may be made by the commissioner of natural resources for the state. A request for special fittings and valves may be made to the commission by a local government, person, company, or corporation. The cost of furnishing and installing the special fittings shall be paid by the state. However, if the special fittings are used by a person for a commercial enterprise or by a municipality for the operation of a utility, the commission shall require that the using person or municipality reimburse the state for the cost of furnishing and installing the special fittings.

#### Article 4. Rates and Rate Schedules.

###### Sec. 42.06.350.   Tariffs, contracts, filing, and public inspection.

(a) Under regulations adopted by the commission, every intrastate oil or gas pipeline carrier shall file with the commission, within the time and in the form designated by the commission, all rates, tariffs, charges, classifications, rules, regulations, terms, and conditions pertaining to service provided under the certificate, and shall maintain copies on file at its principal business office and at places designated by the commission, available to, and subject to inspection by, the general public on demand.

(b) The commission may reject the filing of all or part of a tariff that does not comply with the form or filing regulations of the commission or that is not consistent with this chapter or the regulations of the commission. A tariff or provision rejected by the commission is void.

(c) In its tariff filed with the commission under (a) of this section, a natural gas pipeline carrier may charge separate rates for firm transportation service and for interruptible transportation service. A natural gas pipeline carrier

(1) may, in addition, impose a reservation fee or similar charge for reservation of capacity in a natural gas pipeline as a condition of providing firm transportation service; the reservation fee or charge imposed by the carrier may not include any variable costs or fixed costs that are not attributable to the provision of firm transportation service;

(2) may not impose a reservation fee or similar charge for reservation of capacity in a natural gas pipeline for interruptible transportation service.

###### Sec. 42.06.360.   Adherence to tariffs.

The terms and conditions under which a pipeline carrier offers its services and facilities to the public shall be governed strictly by the provisions of its currently effective tariffs.  A legally filed and effective tariff rate, charge, rule, regulation, or condition of service may not be changed except in the manner provided in this chapter.  If more than one tariff rate or charge can reasonably be applied for billing purposes the one most advantageous to the customer shall be used.

###### Sec. 42.06.370.   Rates to be just and reasonable.

(a) All rates demanded or received by a pipeline carrier, or by any two or more pipeline carriers jointly, for a service furnished or to be furnished shall be just and reasonable.

(b) Additional regulations governing determination of a reasonable tariff shall be published by the commission.

(c) Rates demanded, observed, charged, or collected by a North Slope natural gas pipeline carrier for intrastate service shall be designed as if that portion of the North Slope natural gas pipeline were a public utility regulated under the provisions of AS 42.05.

###### Sec. 42.06.380.   Discrimination in rates.

(a) A pipeline carrier may not, as to rates, grant a preference or advantage to any customer or subject a customer to an unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage. A pipeline carrier may not establish or maintain an unreasonable difference as to rates, either as between localities served or between classes of service provided under the certificate.

(b) A pipeline carrier may not directly or indirectly refund, rebate or remit in any manner, or by any device, any portion of the rates and charges or charge, demand or receive a greater or lesser compensation for service than is specified in its effective tariff nor extend to any customer served under the certificate any form of contract, agreement, inducement, privilege or facility, or apply any rule, regulation or condition of service except as are extended or applied to all customers under like circumstances.

###### Sec. 42.06.390.   Initial or revised rates.

(a) A pipeline carrier may not establish or place in effect any initial rates, charges, rules, regulations, conditions of service or practices except after 90 days' notice to the commission and to the public. Notice shall be given by filing with the commission and keeping open for public inspection the tariff provisions which shall plainly indicate the time when the tariff will go into effect. The commission may prescribe additional means of giving notice. The commission, for good cause shown, may allow initial tariffs to take effect on less than 90 days' notice under conditions the commission prescribes by order.

(b) A pipeline carrier may not establish or place in effect any revised rates, charges, rules, regulations, conditions of service or practices except after 30 days' notice to the commission and to the public.  Notice shall be given by filing with the commission and keeping open for public inspection the revised tariff provisions which shall plainly indicate the changes to be made in the schedules then in force and the time when the changes will go into effect.  The commission may prescribe additional means of giving notice.  The commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes to take effect on less than 30 days' notice under conditions the commission prescribes by order.

(c) Initial and revised tariffs shall be filed in the manner provided in AS 42.06.350.

###### Sec. 42.06.400.   Suspension of tariff filing.

(a) When a tariff filing is made containing an initial or revised rate, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or condition of service the commission may, either upon written complaint or upon its own motion, after reasonable notice, conduct a hearing to determine the reasonableness and propriety of the filing. Pending a hearing the commission may, by order stating the reasons for its action, suspend the operation of the tariff filing for an initial period not longer than six months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect.  If good cause is shown, the commission may suspend the operation of the tariff filing for an additional period not to exceed one year following the end of the initial suspension period. If information on which to base a just and reasonable tariff is lacking or incomplete at the close of the second suspension period, the commission may, during the suspension period and for good cause shown, with or without a hearing, order a further suspension and in such instance shall order the filed rate to be collected, subject to refund of the difference between the filed rate and the final rate, until a final rate can be set.  The commission may order the difference between the temporary rate established under this section and the filed rate to be placed in escrow or secured by bond pending establishment of the final rate.

(b) An order suspending a tariff filing may be vacated if, after investigation, the commission finds that it is in all respects proper.  Otherwise the commission shall hold a hearing on the suspended filing and issue its order, before the end of the suspension period, granting, denying, or modifying the suspended tariff in whole or in part.  If an initial tariff is suspended, the commission shall establish a reasonable temporary tariff.  The commission may allow the collection of the filed initial tariff, or it may require collection of the temporary tariff.  If the commission allows collection of the filed initial tariff, it shall require the pipeline carrier to place the revenue representing the difference between the filed tariff and the temporary tariff in escrow in a financial institution approved by the commission, and keep accurate accounts of all amounts received, specifying by whom and in whose behalf the amounts are paid.  At the end or vacation of the suspension period the amount, if any, owing to the pipeline carrier from the difference between the temporary tariff and the permanent tariff shall be paid to the pipeline carrier.  The surplus, if any, shall be refunded to the persons in whose behalf the amounts were paid into escrow. Funds may not be released from escrow without the commission's prior written consent and instructions to the escrow agent. The commission may allow the pipeline carrier, at the carrier's expense, to substitute a bond or letter of credit in lieu of the escrow requirement.  If the commission requires collection of the temporary tariff, it shall require the shipper to place the revenue representing the difference between the filed initial tariff and the temporary tariff in escrow in a financial institution approved by the commission, and require that accurate accounts similar to those specified above in this section be kept by the carrier and the shipper. The person owing shall pay the person owed to the satisfaction of the commission within 30 days after the commission order allowing or setting a permanent tariff.  The amount, if any, by which the permanent tariff exceeds the temporary tariff shall be paid by the shipper to the carrier, or, if the temporary tariff exceeds the permanent tariff, the difference shall be paid by the carrier to the shipper, and in either event such payment shall be made with interest calculated on the balance due at the end of each calendar month at the legal rate, as defined in AS 45.45.010(a). The commission may allow the shipper, at the shipper's expense, to substitute a bond or letter of credit in place of the escrow requirement.

(c) If a proposed increased rate is suspended, the commission shall establish a reasonable temporary tariff.  The temporary tariff may be the same as the tariff the carrier is seeking to revise.  The commission may allow the collection of the filed proposed increased rate, or it may require collection of the temporary rate.  If the commission allows collection of the filed increased rate, it shall require the pipeline carrier to place the revenue representing the difference between the filed proposed increased rate and the temporary rate in escrow in a financial institution approved by the commission, and keep an accurate account of all amounts received, specifying by whom and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.  At the end or vacation of the suspension period the amount, if any, owing to the pipeline carrier from the difference between the temporary rate and the permanent rate shall be paid to the pipeline carrier. The surplus, if any, shall be refunded to the persons on whose behalf the amounts were paid into escrow. Funds may not be released from escrow without the commission's prior written consent and instructions to the escrow agent. The commission may allow the pipeline carrier, at the carrier's expense, to substitute a bond or letter of credit in place of the escrow requirement.  If the commission requires collection of the temporary rate, it shall require the shipper to place the revenue representing the difference between the proposed increased rate and the temporary rate in escrow in a financial institution approved by the commission, and require that accurate accounts similar to those specified above in this subsection be kept by the carrier and the shipper.  The person owing shall pay the person owed to the satisfaction of the commission within 30 days after the commission's order allowing or setting a permanent tariff.  The commission may allow the shipper, at the shipper's expense, to substitute a bond or letter of credit instead of meeting the escrow requirement.

(d) One who initiates a change in existing tariffs bears the burden of proving the reasonableness of the change.

###### Sec. 42.06.410.   Power of commission to fix rates.

(a) When the commission, after an investigation and hearing, finds that a rate demanded, observed, charged, or collected by a pipeline carrier for a service, subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, or that a classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract affecting the rate, is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, the commission shall determine a just and reasonable rate, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract to be observed or allowed and shall establish it by order.

(b) If an investigation is conducted in multiple phases, the commission may establish a rate at the end of a single phase. The rate established at the end of a single phase is to be considered a final rate under AS 42.06.400.  If the rate established at the conclusion of the proceeding under (a) of this section or after judicial review is less than the rate established after a single phase of an investigation, a shipper is entitled to a refund of the difference between the amounts paid by the shipper and the amounts that would have been paid under the rate established at the conclusion of the proceeding or after judicial review.  If the rate established at the conclusion of the proceeding under (a) of this section or after judicial review is more than the rate established after a single phase, a pipeline carrier is entitled to a payment of the difference between the amounts paid to the carrier and the amount that would have been paid under the rate established at the conclusion of the proceeding or after judicial review.

###### Sec. 42.06.420.   Valuation of property of a pipeline carrier.

The commission may, after providing reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard, ascertain and set the fair value of the whole or any part of the property of a pipeline carrier, insofar as it is material to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the commission.  The commission may make revaluations from time to time and ascertain the fair value of all new construction, extensions, and additions to the property of a pipeline carrier.

In conducting investigations, the commission may compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of records and testimony before the commission or its designee. In the course of an investigation, the commission may exclude from attendance at the taking of investigative testimony all persons except the person compelled to attend, that person's attorney, members of the commission or the commission's staff, and a person authorized to transcribe the proceedings. Following an investigation and after providing reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, the commission may institute proceedings to determine whether unreasonable practices have occurred, whether expenditures have been imprudently incurred, the costs of those practices or expenditures, and whether a pipeline carrier and its affiliated interests are in compliance with this chapter. Following such a determination, the commission shall take appropriate action to ensure that neither the direct nor indirect costs of any unreasonable practices or imprudent expenditures are included in any tariff or rate of a pipeline carrier or are borne by the public or the state.

###### Sec. 42.06.460.   Designation of service agents.

###### Sec. 42.08.230.   Commission decision-making procedures.

The commission shall comply with AS 42.04.080(a) and expeditiously adjudicate all matters that come before the commission.

###### Sec. 42.08.240.   Publication of reports, orders, decisions, and regulations.

All reports, orders, decisions, and regulations of the commission shall be in writing. The commission shall notify all affected operators of in-state natural gas pipeline facilities and interested parties of reports, orders, decisions, and regulations as they are issued and adopted and, when appropriate, publish them in a manner that will reasonably inform the public or the affected consumers of the services of an in-state natural gas pipeline facility. The commission may set charges for costs of printing or reproducing and furnishing copies of reports, orders, decisions, and regulations. The publication requirement, as it pertains to regulations, does not supersede the requirements of AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act).

###### Sec. 42.08.250.   Application of Administrative Procedure Act.

(a) The administrative adjudication procedures of AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) do not apply to adjudicatory proceedings of the commission under this chapter, except that final administrative determinations by the commission are subject to judicial review under AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) as provided in AS 42.08.530.

(b) AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) applies to regulations adopted by the commission.

###### Sec. 42.08.260.   Annual report.

The commission shall include in its annual reports under AS 42.05.211 and AS 42.06.220 a review of its activities under this chapter during the previous fiscal year.

#### Article 3. Contract Review; Contract Carriage Certificate; Open Seasons.

###### Sec. 42.08.300.   Open seasons.

(a) An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall include in its approved recourse tariff the procedures for conducting open seasons for uncommitted firm transportation service and for expansion. At a minimum, the in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall publish reasonable public notice in advance of an open season. The notice shall contain the approved recourse tariff, the proposed form of the precedent agreement, the proposed form of the firm transportation service agreement, and other information sufficient to show the proposed route, capacity, operating pressures, in-service date, quality specifications, and other operating conditions that the pipeline carrier determines are relevant to an evaluation of the proposed service. The notice shall also state the methods for awarding capacity set out in the carrier's recourse tariff and whether presubscription agreements have been executed. An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall provide a mechanism for providing additional relevant information requested by potential shippers.

(b) An open season shall be conducted and firm transportation service shall be awarded without undue discrimination or preference. Presubscription agreements are subject to the methods for awarding capacity set out in the open season notice.

(c) An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall conduct an open season for firm transportation service when it has existing uncommitted firm transportation capacity and has received a request for firm transportation capacity from one or more potential shippers that meet the pipeline's creditworthiness requirements or after it has executed presubscription agreements for firm transportation.

(d) An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall conduct an open season for an expansion of its pipeline system when it has received one or more requests for firm transportation service from potential shippers that meet the pipeline's creditworthiness requirements and that, in the aggregate, would enable the expansion of the pipeline's system on a commercially reasonable basis. An expansion of the pipeline system is not commercially reasonable if the expansion would cause the pipeline to be a competing natural gas pipeline project for purposes of AS 43.90.

(e) A natural gas pipeline carrier may enter into presubscription agreements before the start of an open season, but not before an initial recourse tariff is approved.

(f) An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall file revised recourse rates before conducting an open season under (c) and (d) of this section unless the in-state natural gas pipeline carrier filed revised recourse rates during the immediately preceding two-year period.

(g) If executed precedent agreements are received by an in-state natural gas pipeline carrier, the carrier shall, within 10 days after accepting and executing the agreements, inform the public of the results through publication on the carrier's Internet website and in a press release or other announcement to the media. The results made public must include the name of each prospective shipper, the amount of capacity allocated, and the period of commitment. If the carrier determines that the commitments received during the open season are not sufficient to permit the carrier to continue the development or construction of the in-state natural gas pipeline, the corporation shall report that to the commission within 30 days.

###### Sec. 42.08.310.   Transportation service.

(a) Firm transportation service shall be made available only through a presubscription agreement, a recourse tariff, or an open season conducted in accordance with AS 42.08.300.

(b) The pipeline carrier shall offer a recourse tariff for firm transportation service. The rates included in the recourse tariff shall be determined on a cost-of-service basis and may be levelized over the depreciable life of the pipeline. The recourse tariff may not preclude the pipeline carrier from collecting rolled-in rates so long as the resulting rate for prior shippers does not exceed the initial maximum rate allowable under agreements for capacity.

(c) An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier may contract to provide firm transportation service for rates and containing provisions different than those in the recourse tariff. For purposes of this subsection, "provisions" are limited to those terms and conditions that directly relate to the rate and do not include the general operating terms and conditions of the recourse tariff.

(d) An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall provide interruptible transportation service through capacity not used for firm transportation service. An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall establish means for routinely advising potential shippers of the availability of interruptible transportation service and of uncommitted firm transportation capacity.

###### Sec. 42.08.320.   Review of certain contracts by the commission.

(a) An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall submit each of its precedent agreements for firm transportation service and any substantial amendments to the commission. A precedent agreement negotiated with an entity that is not a public utility regulated by the commission may be filed under seal. Under AS 42.08.400, the commission shall keep confidential a precedent agreement filed under seal. Submission of precedent agreements to the commission is permissible before construction of an in-state natural gas pipeline and before a request for certification under this chapter. In this subsection, "substantial amendment" means an amendment that materially changes a rate or term and condition of service.

(b) In the review of a precedent agreement submitted under (a) of this section or a related contract submitted under AS 42.05.433(b) or (c), the commission shall

(1) conclude that a precedent agreement or related contract negotiated at arm's length between the parties is just and reasonable unless the commission finds that unlawful market activity affected the rate or unfair dealing, such as fraud or duress, affected the formation of the contract;

(2) review and may conduct an investigation and hearing to determine whether a contract submitted under (a) of this section is just and reasonable; the commission shall either approve the contract as presented or, if the commission finds that a contract is not just and reasonable, disapprove the contract; if the commission has not acted within 180 days after the submission of a contract, the contract shall be considered approved and shall take effect immediately; a contract that is approved or considered approved under this paragraph and the associated firm transportation service agreement are not subject to further review by the commission.

(c) For purposes of (b)(1) of this section, and except as provided in (d) of this section, a precedent agreement or related contract is arm's length

(1) if it incorporates the approved recourse tariff; or

(2) if it does not incorporate the approved recourse tariff,

(A) the precedent agreement or related contract is between two state-owned parties;

(B) the parties are not affiliated; or

(C) if the parties are affiliated, the precedent agreement or related contract is substantially similar to a precedent agreement or related contract between unaffiliated parties, and the formation of the precedent agreement or related contract was not affected by unlawful market activity or unfair dealing as described in (b)(1) of this section.

(d) Notwithstanding (c) of this section, a precedent agreement or related contract with a public utility is not arm's length if the rate paid for transportation on an in-state natural gas pipeline is greater than the recourse tariff rate.

(e) If a precedent agreement or related contract is not arm's length, the commission shall determine whether the precedent agreement or related contract is just and reasonable using the standards normally applied under AS 42.06.140. If the commission is reviewing a precedent agreement under (c)(2) of this section, the commission may consider the in-state natural gas pipeline carrier's approved recourse tariff, including the cost data underlying the tariff. When considering whether to approve a contract as just and reasonable under this subsection, the commission shall consider the consequences of failing to approve the contract.

###### Sec. 42.08.330.   Contract carriage certificate.

(a) The owner of an in-state natural gas pipeline subject to this chapter may not engage in the transportation of natural gas or undertake the construction of a natural gas pipeline facility for that purpose, or acquire or operate an in-state natural gas pipeline facility, unless a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the commission authorizing contract carriage is in force with respect to that owner. A certificate shall describe the nature and extent of the authority granted, including, as appropriate for the services involved, a description of the authorized area and scope of operation for the in-state natural gas pipeline facility.

(b) Application for a certificate shall be made in writing to the commission and verified under oath. The commission by regulation shall establish the requirements for the form of the application and the information to be contained in the application. Notice of the application shall be provided to interested parties in the manner provided by regulation.

(c) Within 180 days after receiving an application under this chapter, the commission shall issue a contract carriage certificate authorizing, in whole or in part, the operation, service, construction, or acquisition covered by the application to a qualified applicant if the commission finds that the applicant is fit, willing, and able to do the acts, perform the proposed service, and conform to the provisions of this chapter and the requirements of the commission, and that the proposed service, operation, construction, extension, or acquisition, to the extent authorized by the certificate, is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity. The commission may, by order, extend the 180-day period for considering an application by the duration of a delay caused by the failure of the applicant to provide additional information reasonably required by the commission. If, within the 180-day period and any extension of the period for considering the application, the commission fails to issue a contract carriage certificate and does not make a finding that the applicant is not fit, willing, and able under this subsection or that the proposed service is not required by public convenience and necessity, the application shall be considered approved and the contract carriage certificate shall take effect immediately.

(d) The commission may attach to a contract carriage certificate reasonable terms and conditions that are consistent with the terms of this chapter and are for the mutual benefit of the in-state natural gas pipeline facility and the public.

(e) Operating authority may not be transferred by sale or lease of the contract carriage certificate or by the sale of substantially all of the stock or assets of a pipeline carrier holding a certificate without prior approval and a finding by the commission that the safe and efficient operation of the natural gas pipeline is not impaired by the transfer. The commission shall summarily approve a transfer not involving a substantial change in ownership.

(f) After receiving a complaint or on its own motion, the commission, after notice and hearing and for good cause shown, may amend, modify, suspend, or revoke, in whole or in part, a certificate. Good cause for amendment, modification, suspension, or revocation of a certificate is shown by

(1) misrepresentation of a material fact in obtaining the certificate;

(2) unauthorized discontinuance or abandonment of all or part of a service that is the subject of the certificate;

(3) wilful failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or a regulation or order of the commission; or

(4) wilful failure to comply with a term, condition, or limitation of the certificate.

(g) A person holding a certificate issued under this chapter may not abandon or permanently discontinue the use of all or a portion of an in-state natural gas pipeline without permission and approval by the commission, after due notice and hearing and a finding by the commission that continued service is not required by public convenience and necessity. An interested person may file a protest or memorandum of opposition to or in support of discontinuance or abandonment with the commission. The commission may order the temporary suspension of a service or part of a service.

###### Sec. 42.08.340.   Filing requirements; recourse tariffs.

(a) An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall file with the commission a complete recourse tariff containing rates, rules, regulations, terms, and conditions pertaining to service provided under the certificate and copies of all contracts with shippers that in any way affect or relate to the carrier's rates, tariffs, charges, classifications, rules, regulations, terms, and conditions to service provided under the certificate.

(b) The terms and conditions under which an in-state natural gas pipeline carrier offers its services and facilities to the public shall be governed strictly by the provisions of its currently effective recourse tariff as supplemented and modified by contracts that have been approved by the commission. A legally filed and effective recourse tariff rate, charge, rule, regulation, or condition of service may not be changed except as provided in this chapter. The in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall maintain copies of its recourse tariff on file at its principal business office and at places designated by the commission and make the copies available to and subject to inspection by the general public on demand.

(c) A change in a recourse tariff rate, charge, rule, regulation, or condition of service is not effective until filed under (a) of this section. If more than one recourse tariff rate or charge may reasonably be applied for billing purposes, the recourse tariff rate or charge most advantageous to the shipper shall be used.

(d) The commission may reject the filing of all or part of a recourse tariff that is not consistent with this chapter. A recourse tariff rate or provision so rejected is void.

(e) Initial and revised recourse tariffs shall be filed in the manner provided in AS 42.08.350.

###### Sec. 42.08.350.   Initial or revised rates.

(a) An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier may not establish or place in effect an initial recourse tariff containing rates, charges, rules, regulations, conditions of service, or practices without providing notice to the commission and to the public at least 90 days before establishing or placing in effect the initial recourse tariff. Notice shall be filed with the commission before an open season and by making the recourse tariff provisions available for public inspection. The notice shall plainly indicate the time when the recourse tariff will go into effect and include a supporting cost study. The commission may prescribe additional requirements for the notice and the form in which the notice must be provided. The commission, for good cause shown, may allow initial recourse tariffs to take effect on less than 90 days' notice under conditions the commission prescribes by order. Submission of a precedent agreement or an associated contract is not subject to this section.

(b) The commission shall review the proposed initial recourse tariff and verify that the proposed terms and conditions of service are not unduly discriminatory. The commission also shall review the supporting cost study provided with an initial recourse tariff filing and verify, taking into consideration the expected risks, that the proposed rate of return on equity is within the range of permissible rates of return as determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in recent decisions related to the construction of natural gas pipelines, that the cost study incorporates a reasonable depreciation methodology and depreciable life, and that the cost study uses a reasonable capital structure. A proposed depreciation methodology, depreciable life, or capital structure is reasonable if it is commonly accepted or used by the commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

(c) Upon written complaint or in its own motion, and after reasonable notice, the commission may conduct a hearing to determine whether the initial recourse tariff filed with the commission complies with the requirements in (b) of this section. Pending a hearing the commission may, by order stating the reasons for its action, suspend the operation of the initial recourse tariff for a period not longer than 30 days beyond the time when the initial recourse tariff would otherwise go into effect. An order suspending an initial recourse tariff filing may be vacated if, after investigation, the commission finds that it is in all respects proper. Otherwise, the commission shall hold a hearing on the suspended filing and issue its order, before the end of the suspension period, approving or denying the suspended initial recourse tariff.

(d) Unless a recourse tariff is denied because it includes a proposed term or condition of service that is unduly discriminatory, includes a proposed rate element that does not comply with (b) of this section, or violates a provision of this chapter, the commission shall approve the initial recourse tariff. If the commission does not issue its ruling within the 90-day period, and the period of suspension, if any, the initial recourse tariff filing shall be considered approved.

(e) An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier may not establish or place in effect a revised rate, charge, rule, regulation, condition of service, or practice contained in a recourse tariff before providing notice to the commission and to the public at least 90 days before taking the action. After construction or an expansion of the pipeline, and at any time that a carrier files for a revised recourse rate, the carrier shall file a supporting cost study. Notice shall be given by filing with the commission and keeping open for public inspection the revised recourse tariff provisions, which shall plainly indicate the changes to be made in the schedules then in force and the time when the changes will go into effect. The commission may prescribe additional means of giving notice. The commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes to take effect on shorter notice under conditions the commission prescribes by order. Submission of a precedent agreement or an associated contract is not subject to this subsection.

(f) The commission shall review a proposed revised recourse tariff in the same manner as the review of a proposed initial recourse tariff under (b) of this section, except that the depreciable life may be adjusted in accordance with the time period between the approval of the recourse tariff and the approval of the revised recourse tariff. The commission shall verify that the carrier is using the same elements that were last approved by the commission. A proposed recourse tariff with a new or revised term or condition of service that is unduly discriminatory shall be denied. The commission also shall deny a revised tariff rate that does not use the previously approved value of the specified rate element, unless the carrier proves that the new value is just and reasonable. If the commission does not issue its ruling within 90 days, the revised recourse tariff filing shall be considered approved.

(g) A person initiating a change in an existing recourse tariff bears the burden of proving the reasonableness of the change. The in-state natural gas pipeline carrier bears the burden of proving the recourse tariff terms and conditions are not unduly discriminatory.

(h) An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall provide for separate rates for one or more classes of firm transportation service and for interruptible transportation service in a recourse tariff filed with the commission under (a) of this section. An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier may impose a reservation fee or similar charge for reservation of capacity in an in-state natural gas pipeline as a condition of providing firm transportation service, but may not impose a reservation fee or similar charge for reservation of capacity in an in-state natural gas pipeline for interruptible transportation service.

###### Sec. 42.08.370.   Expansion; dispute resolution.

(a) A contract entered into by an in-state natural gas pipeline carrier may provide for expansion unless the expansion would cause the pipeline to be a competing natural gas pipeline project for purposes of AS 43.90.

(b) The recourse tariff or a contract filed by an in-state natural gas pipeline carrier may include a dispute resolution procedure. A dispute resolution procedure shall

(1) provide that notice of a dispute be given to all shippers;

(2) culminate in a process that is determined by an independent third party or panel; and

(3) permit the participation of existing shippers and creditworthy potential shippers that have previously made good-faith requests for firm transportation service; a participant must satisfy the commission's standard for intervention in an adjudicatory proceeding and demonstrate that the participant has a property, financial, or other significant interest in the dispute.

###### Sec. 42.08.380.   Regulatory cost charge.

(a) Each year, a person operating an in-state natural gas pipeline under this chapter shall pay to the commission a regulatory cost charge if the pipeline for which the charge is assessed is subject to this chapter and the commission has taken action on the pipeline or certificate under this chapter during the prior fiscal year. The amount of the regulatory cost charge may not exceed the sum of the following percentages of gross revenue derived from operations in the state:

(1) 0.7 percent to fund the operations of the commission; and

(2) 0.17 percent to fund operations of the public advocacy function under AS 42.04.070(c) and AS 44.23.020(e) in the Department of Law.

(b) The commission shall by regulation establish a method to determine annually the amount of the regulatory cost charge that will apply to a pipeline regulated under this chapter. If the amount the commission expects to collect under (a) of this section, AS 42.05.254(a), and AS 42.06.286(a) exceeds the authorized budgets of the commission and the Department of Law public advocacy function under AS 42.04.070(c) and AS 44.23.020(e), the commission shall, by order, reduce the percentage determined under a regulation adopted under this subsection so that the total amount of the fees collected approximately equals the authorized budgets of the commission and the Department of Law public advocacy function under AS 42.04.070(c) and AS 44.23.020(e) for the fiscal year.

(c) The commission shall administer the charge imposed under this section. The Department of Revenue shall collect and enforce the charge imposed under this section. The Department of Administration shall identify the amount of the operating budgets of the commission and the Department of Law public advocacy function under AS 42.04.070(c) and AS 44.23.020(e) that lapses into the general fund each year. The legislature may appropriate an amount equal to the lapsed amount to the commission and to the Department of Law public advocacy function under AS 42.04.070(c) and AS 44.23.020(e) for operating costs for the next fiscal year. If the legislature does so, the commission shall reduce the total regulatory cost charge collected for that fiscal year by a comparable amount.

(d) The commission may adopt regulations under AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) necessary to administer this section, including procedures and requirements for reporting information and a requirement for paying the regulatory cost charge in quarterly payments. The Department of Revenue may adopt regulations under AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) for investigating the accuracy of filed information and for collecting required payments.

###### Sec. 42.08.390.   Effect of chapter on taxes and royalties.

Nothing in this chapter shall alter the calculation of a production tax under AS 43.55.011§43.55.180 or the calculation of a royalty due for a lease issued under AS 38.05.180.

#### Article 4. Public Records; Investigations.

###### Sec. 42.08.400.   Public records.

(a) Except as provided in (b) and (c) of this section or prohibited from disclosure under state or federal law, records in the possession of the commission are open to public inspection at reasonable times.

(b) The commission may by regulation classify records received from an in-state natural gas pipeline carrier or in-state natural gas pipeline as privileged records that are not open to the public for inspection.

(c) A record filed with the commission that is a precedent agreement between an in-state natural gas pipeline carrier and an unregulated entity is a privileged record that is not open to the public for inspection. For a record that relates to a precedent agreement, or is or relates to a contract other than a precedent agreement between an in-state natural gas pipeline carrier and an unregulated entity, if an in-state natural gas pipeline carrier identifies the provisions of the record that contain information that, if disclosed, could adversely affect the competitive position of the shipper or could cause commercial or competitive harm or damage if disclosed and the commission agrees, the information shall be treated by the commission as confidential.

(d) A person may make written objection to the public disclosure of information contained in a record filed under this chapter or of information obtained by the commission or by the attorney general under this chapter, stating the grounds for the objection. When an objection is made, the commission shall order the information withheld from public disclosure if the information adversely affects the interest of the person making written objection and disclosure is not required in the interest of the public.

(e) A commissioner may certify as to all official records of the commission under this section and may certify as to all official acts of the commission under this chapter.

###### Sec. 42.08.410.   Investigations.

The commission may investigate any matter for which an investigation is authorized under this chapter. An investigation may be public, nonpublic, or both. In conducting an investigation, the commission may compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of records and testimony before the commission or its designee. In the course of an investigation, the commission may, subject to AS 44.23.020(e), exclude from attendance at the taking of investigative testimony all persons except a person compelled to attend, that person's attorney, members of the commission or the commission's staff, and a person authorized to transcribe the proceedings. In conducting an investigation related to a timely filed dispute, the commission shall issue a final order within 150 days after the date the formal complaint was filed with the commission, except for disputes related to open seasons, in which case, a final order must be issued within 60 days. If the commission has not acted within the applicable time period in this section, the dispute shall be considered to have been dismissed with prejudice.

#### Article 5. Accounts, Records, and Reports.

###### Sec. 42.08.440.   Uniform system of accounts.

An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier operating under this chapter shall maintain its records and accounts in accordance with the uniform system of accounts for class A natural gas pipelines in 18 C.F.R. 201 (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), as amended.

###### Sec. 42.08.450.   Accounts; records; triennial reports; operating reserve fund.

(a) To the extent necessary for the commission to perform the duties of the commission under this chapter,

(1) the commission may by regulation require an in-state natural gas pipeline carrier or affiliated interest engaged in activities relating to pipelines to establish and maintain as part of its system of accounts continuing property records showing, as to property that is actually being used in pipeline activity in this state, the year of placement in service, original cost, and current location, and, as to a pipeline system, accounts and records in a manner showing, on a current basis, the original cost of the system in the state and related reserves for depreciation;

(2) the in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall

(A) keep its accounts for its pipeline facilities located in this state separate from any accounts relating to any other business, including another pipeline facilities business or a subsidiary business, in which it engages, directly or indirectly; except as the commission provides, property, expense, or revenue used in or derived from the other business may not be considered in establishing the rates and charges of the facility;

(B) keep books, accounts, papers, and records required by this chapter or by regulations adopted by the commission under this chapter in an office in this state and may not remove them from the state except upon written authority by the commission; and

(C) file a report with the commission that contains an updated cost study and a calculation of the three-year average actual return on equity; the report shall be filed every three years after the pipeline begins operations, within 90 days after the close of the annual accounting period for the in-state natural gas pipeline carrier, or within additional time granted by the commission upon a showing of good cause.

(b) The commission shall review the cost study described in (a)(2)(C) of this section and verify that, for the rate elements specified in AS 42.08.350(b), the carrier is using the same elements that were last approved by the commission. If the carrier does not use the correct rate elements in its triennial report, the commission may require the carrier to recalculate and file a corrected report. If, on the date the report described in (a)(2)(C) of this section is delivered, the report reflects that the three-year average actual return on equity exceeds the approved rate of return, the carrier shall, not later than 90 days after the date the report is delivered, deposit an amount equal to the excess in a segregated operating reserve fund. The carrier shall continue to deposit the excess described in this subsection at the times described in this subsection until the amount in the operating reserve fund is equal to 20 percent of the most recent three-year average of the carrier's annual operating costs. The carrier may use money in the operating reserve fund to offset any shortage in the recovery of operating costs set out in another triennial report. If a deposit will cause the operating reserve fund to exceed 20 percent of the most recent three-year average of the carrier's annual operating costs, the amount exceeding 20 percent must be used to reduce, on a volumetric basis, the firm transportation service rates for all shippers for the next three-year period.

#### Article 6. General Provisions.

###### Sec. 42.08.510.   Designation of service agents.

An in-state natural gas pipeline carrier shall file with the commission a written appointment of a named permanent resident, which may be a corporation, of this state as its registered agent in this state on whom service of all notices, regulations, and requests of the commission may be made. The appointment shall specify the address in this state of the appointed agent. The address may be changed from time to time by filing a new address in the state with the commission. If an in-state natural gas pipeline carrier fails to appoint a registered agent, service of notices, regulations, and requests may be made by posting a copy in the main office of the commission and filing a copy in the office of the lieutenant governor.

###### Sec. 42.08.520.   Effect of regulations.

Regulations adopted by the commission under this chapter have the effect of law.

###### Sec. 42.08.530.   Judicial review and enforcement.

(a) Except as provided in AS 38.35.200(c), a final order of the commission under this chapter is subject to judicial review under AS 44.62.560 and 44.62.570.

(b) If an appeal is not taken from a final order of the commission within 10 calendar days after an investigation under AS 42.08.220(b)(3), the commission may apply to the superior court for enforcement of the order of the commission.

Complete natural defenses against the entrance of stock, such as natural walls or deep ditches, are lawful fences within the meaning of AS 42.30.150§42.30.190 when they form, in connection with other legal fences, a continuous guard and defense against the entrance of livestock upon the track.

###### Sec. 42.30.170.   Notice and filing of killing or injury.

Whenever livestock mentioned in AS 42.30.150 is killed or injured upon an unfenced railroad track, the person owning or operating the railroad, or that person's lessee or agent, or an authorized agent or employee, shall immediately have a notice of killing or injury filed by filing a concise description of the animal killed or injured, including brand, earmark, or other marks of ownership with the railroad agents at the two extremities of the section on which the killing or injury took place.

A person who neglects or fails to file or have filed the notice provided for in AS 42.30.170 is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction is punishable by a fine of not more than $200 for each offense.

###### Sec. 42.30.190.   Action for killing or injury.

In an action for the recovery of the value of livestock referred to in AS 42.30.150, proof of death or injury is conclusive evidence of negligence upon the part of the person or the person's lessee or agent owning or operating the railroad.  Contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff in the action is a defense. However, allowing stock to run at large upon common unfenced range or upon enclosed land owned or in possession of the owner is not contributory negligence.  Proof of wilful intent on the part of the plaintiff to procure the death or injury of stock defeats the recovery of damages for death or injury.

In the case of a request to locate in a remote or unstaffed location, the excavator shall notify the operator at least 10 but not more than 20 working days before the scheduled date for beginning excavation.

(c) In an emergency, the excavator shall immediately notify each underground facility operator in the area of the emergency and of the need for the excavation and request prompt location of underground facilities.

###### Sec. 42.30.410.   Operator's response to request to locate; immunity related to unmarked or inaccurately marked facilities.

(a) An underground facility operator shall accept requests to locate underground facilities during the operator's regular business hours. An operator who receives a request to locate shall maintain for at least one year an accurate record of the request and responses to the request.

(b) When an underground facility operator receives a request to locate, it shall notify the excavator of the location of the underground facilities that the operator is able to field mark with reasonable accuracy and field mark those facilities. If the operator owns, uses, or operates an underground facility that is identified as being in the area of the proposed excavation but that the operator cannot field mark with reasonable accuracy, the operator shall provide the excavator with the best information available to the operator about its location and shall provide on-site assistance until the facility is located or until the excavator no longer needs assistance in locating that facility.

(c) The field marks for an underground facility buried 10 feet deep or less must be located within 24 horizontal inches of the outside dimensions of the facility. For a facility buried deeper than 10 feet, the operator shall locate the field marks within 30 horizontal inches of the outside dimensions of the facility. The operator shall use stakes, paint, or other clearly identifiable material to show the field location of the underground facility. The marker used to designate the approximate location of an underground facility must follow the current color code standard used by the American Public Works Association.

(d) Except for an underground facility in a remote, unstaffed, or inaccessible location, an underground facility operator shall respond to a request to locate promptly. A response is considered to be prompt if it is made within two working days after the operator receives the request or at a later time so long as the response occurs before the beginning of the excavation. For an underground facility in an accessible remote or unstaffed location, the operator shall respond within 10 working days after the operator receives the request or at a later time so long as the response occurs before the beginning of excavation.

(e) After an operator has field marked an underground facility, the excavator is responsible for maintaining the markings.

(f) An excavator may not begin to excavate until each underground facility has been field marked.

(g) When an operator has field marked an underground facility once at the request of an excavator, the operator has the right to receive compensation from the excavator for costs incurred in responding to subsequent requests to locate the same underground facility during the same excavation project if the excavator failed to maintain the original marking.

(h) If an excavator discovers an underground facility that was not field marked or was inaccurately field marked, the excavator shall immediately stop excavating in the vicinity of the facility and shall notify the operator of the discovery. The excavator may notify the operator by means of a notification center. The operator shall treat the notification as a request to locate in an emergency and shall respond accordingly. An excavator may not be held liable for inadvertent damage caused to an unmarked or an inaccurately marked underground facility.

(i) Unless the request to locate is made in response to an emergency, an underground facility operator has the right to receive compensation for costs incurred in responding to a request to locate that gives the operator less notice than the minimum notice required by this section. This subsection may not be interpreted to require the operator to respond to the request to locate within the time requested in the notice.

###### Sec. 42.30.420.   Responsibility of construction project owners.

The owner of a construction project that will require excavation shall indicate in bid documents or contracts for construction the existence of underground facilities that the project owner knows are located inside of the proposed area of excavation. This requirement does not release the excavator from the excavator's responsibility under AS 42.30.400§42.30.490.

###### Sec. 42.30.430.   Obligations concerning the conduct of excavations.

(a) An excavator shall use reasonable care to avoid damaging an underground facility. The excavator shall

(1) determine, without damage to the facility, the precise location of an underground facility whose location has been marked;

(2) plan the excavation to avoid damage to and minimize interference with an underground facility in or near the excavation area; and

(3) to the extent necessary to protect a facility from damage, provide support for an underground facility in and near the construction area during the excavation.

(b) An excavator who, in the course of excavation, contacts or damages an underground facility shall notify the operator. If the damage causes an emergency, the excavator shall also alert appropriate local public safety agencies and take reasonable steps to ensure public safety. A damaged underground facility may not be reburied until it is repaired or relocated to the satisfaction of the operator. The operator of an underground facility that was damaged during excavation shall arrange for repair or relocation of the facility as soon as practical.

###### Sec. 42.30.440.   Penalties; injunctive relief.

(a) In addition to all other remedies provided by law, a person who violates a provision of AS 42.30.400§42.30.490 is subject to a civil penalty of not less than $50 nor more than $1,000 for each offense if the violation results in or significantly contributes to damage to an underground facility.

(b) If the court finds that an excavator is violating or threatening to violate a provision of AS 42.30.400§42.30.490 and the violation may result in damage to an underground facility, the court may grant injunctive relief to the underground facility operator.

###### Sec. 42.30.450.   Waiver of requirements by written agreement.

An operator and an excavator may, by written agreement, waive the requirements of AS 42.30.400§42.30.490 that the excavator notify the operator of planned excavations and that the operator locate underground facilities. The agreement must identify the geographic areas to which the waiver applies and the time period for which the waiver is valid.

###### Sec. 42.30.460.   Underground facility owner.

If the operator of an underground facility is not the owner of the facility and if the operator cannot be identified or has been identified but cannot be reached in a reasonable amount of time, the excavator may give the notice required by AS 42.30.400§42.30.490 to the owner of the underground facility and the owner shall assume the duties and responsibilities of the operator under AS 42.30.400§42.30.490.

(2) the Department of Natural Resources shall convey the state's entire interest in the land within the boundaries of the survey to the corporation, subject to valid existing rights, and reserving to the state (A) the interests required by AS 38.05.125; (B) the right of the department to identify and reserve rights-of-way for potential future crossings under (g) of this section; and (C) the authority of the department to identify, reserve, authorize, and manage land within the transportation corridor and associated rail land for future right-of-way leases and uses under AS 38.35; the conveyance of land under this paragraph shall be without cost to the corporation except for the direct administrative costs of the department;

(3) the Department of Natural Resources shall assign any existing contracts within that segment of the transportation corridor and associated rail land to the corporation; the corporation may thereafter retain the revenue from the conveyed land; the department shall prorate revenue from contracts affecting both conveyed and unconveyed land;

(4) the remaining state land in a segment of the transportation corridor in which the corporation has received a conveyance under this section shall be managed by the Department of Natural Resources as a transportation corridor unless the department determines the land is no longer needed for that purpose; and

(5) the remaining segments of the transportation corridor in which the corporation has not completed construction and any associated state land designated as rail land shall continue to be managed by the Department of Natural Resources as a transportation corridor and associated rail land under (c) and (d) of this section.

(f) Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, before the Department of Natural Resources grants a gas pipeline right-of-way lease under AS 38.35.020(a) across a transportation corridor or associated rail land delineated, identified, reserved, or conveyed under this section, the department shall consult with the corporation; if a railroad improvement has not been constructed on a segment of the transportation corridor or associated rail land that is crossed by the proposed gas pipeline right-of-way, the department may adjust the location of the transportation corridor or associated rail land if the department finds that relocation of the transportation corridor or associated rail land to accommodate the proposed gas pipeline right-of-way is in the best interest of the state.

(g) In delegating management authority over or conveying all or a portion of state land to the corporation, the Department of Natural Resources shall reserve the right to authorize, by lease, permit, or other method, a person to cross or construct access across the transportation corridor and associated rail land; however, before authorizing a crossing or construction of access, the department shall obtain concurrence from the corporation that the proposed crossing or construction is consistent with applicable safety standards and, to the extent practical, minimizes effects on railroad operating efficiency. Neither the corporation nor the state is liable for claims arising from public use of the transportation corridor and associated rail land, except to the extent the claims arise from the gross negligence of the state, the corporation, their employees, or their contractors, respectively. The department shall indemnify the corporation consistent with AS 42.40.420(1)§(3) for claims or related litigation arising from an authorization issued by the department under this section, except to the extent the claims arise from the gross negligence of the corporation, its employees, or its contractors.

(h) The corporation shall,

(1) as the corporation considers appropriate, exercise its authority under this chapter to acquire rights-of-way across land within the transportation corridor and associated rail land that is subject to the corporation's power of eminent domain;

(2) upon delineation of the transportation corridor and identification of associated rail land, expeditiously work with federal officials to secure reclassification and withdrawal of federal land for reservations and rights-of-way across the federal land for use as transportation corridor and rail land; and

(3) before undertaking acquisition of federal land, prepare a report evaluating the effects of construction of an extension of the Alaska Railroad across federal land; the statement must satisfy the requirements for an environmental impact statement under 42 U.S.C. 4332.

The limit of the strike is determined by the interest of the health, safety, or welfare of the public.

(b) The corporation may apply to the superior court in the judicial district in which the strike is occurring for an order enjoining the strike.

The costs used in determining the power cost equalization per kilowatt-hour shall exclude any other type of assistance that reduces the customer's costs of power on a kilowatt-hour basis and that is provided to the electric utility within 60 days before the commission determines the power cost equalization per kilowatt-hour of the electric utility. In calculating power cost equalization, the commission may not consider validated costs or kilowatt-hour sales associated with a United States Department of Defense facility.

(b) An eligible electric utility is entitled to receive power cost equalization

(1) for sales of power to local community facilities, calculated in the aggregate for each community served by the electric utility, for actual consumption of not more than 70 kilowatt-hours a month for each resident of the community; the number of community residents shall be determined annually by the latest figures of the United States Bureau of the Census or other population data that the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development determines is reliable; and

(2) for actual consumption of not more than 750 kilowatt-hours a month sold to each residential customer.

(c) The amount of power cost equalization provided for each kilowatt-hour under (b) of this section may not exceed 95 percent of the power costs, or the average rate for each eligible kilowatt-hour sold, whichever is less, as determined by the commission. However,

(1) the power costs for which power cost equalization are paid to an electric utility are limited to minimum power costs of more than 12 cents a kilowatt-hour and less than $1 a kilowatt-hour;

(2) each year, the commission shall adjust the power costs for which power cost equalization may be paid to an electric utility based on the weighted average retail residential rate in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau; however, the commission may not adjust the power costs under this paragraph to reduce the amount below the lower limit set out in (1) of this subsection; and

(3) the power cost equalization for each kilowatt-hour may be determined for a utility without historical kilowatt-hour sales data by using kilowatt-hours generated.

(d) An electric utility whose customers receive power cost equalization under AS 42.45.100§42.45.150 shall set out in its tariff the rates without the power cost equalization and the amount of power cost equalization per kilowatt-hour sold. The rate charged to the customer shall be the difference between the two amounts. Power cost equalization paid under AS 42.45.100§42.45.150 shall be used to reduce the cost of all power sold to local community facilities, in the aggregate, to the extent of 70 kilowatt-hours per month per resident of the community, and to reduce the cost of the first 500 kilowatt-hours per residential customer per month.

(e) The power cost equalization program shall be administered by the authority based on a determination by the commission under (a) and (c) of this section of power cost equalization per kilowatt-hour for each eligible electric utility.

(f) The authority may not deny an eligible electric utility power cost equalization because complete cost information is not available. The commission shall assist an eligible electric utility that is exempt from rate regulation under AS 42.05 to provide the cost information the commission considers necessary to comply with AS 42.45.100§42.45.150. Only power costs that are supportable may be considered in calculating power cost equalization. Each electric utility is responsible for keeping records that provide the information necessary to comply with AS 42.45.100§42.45.150 including records of monthly kilowatt-hour sales or generation, monthly fuel balances, fuel purchases, and monthly utility fuel consumption.

(g) The commission shall determine the cost of fuel for each eligible electric utility using the procedure for approving fuel cost rate adjustments of electric utilities subject to rate regulation under AS 42.05.

(h) Each electric utility receiving power cost equalization approved by the commission shall

(1) report monthly to the authority within the time and in the form the authority requires; and

(2) use operational equipment designed to meter individual utility customer power consumption and to determine and record the utility's overall fuel consumption.

(i) The authority shall review the report required under (h) of this section. After review and approval of the report, the authority shall, subject to appropriation, pay to each eligible electric utility an amount equal to the power cost equalization per kilowatt-hour determined under (a) and (c) of this section, multiplied by the number of kilowatt-hours eligible for power cost equalization that were sold during the preceding month to all customers of the utility under (b) of this section. Payment shall be made by the authority within 30 days after receipt from the utility of the report required under (h) of this section. If appropriations that have been made for the purpose by July 1 of a fiscal year are insufficient for payment in full, the amount paid to each electric utility shall be reduced on a pro rata basis. In making the pro rata reductions required by this subsection, the authority may not consider any potential supplemental appropriation until the appropriation has been enacted.

###### Sec. 42.45.115.   Exclusion from eligibility.
