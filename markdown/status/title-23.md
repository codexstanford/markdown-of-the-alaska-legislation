(a) An employer who violates a provision of AS 23.10.060 or 23.10.065 is liable to an employee affected in the amount of unpaid minimum wages, or unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and, except as provided in (d) of this section, in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.

(b) An action to recover from the employer the wages and damages for which the employer is liable may be maintained in a competent court by an employee personally and for other employees similarly situated, or an employee may individually designate in writing an agent or representative to maintain an action for the employee.  The consent shall be filed in the court in which the action is brought.  At the request of a person paid less than the amount to which the person is entitled under AS 23.10.050§23.10.150, the commissioner may take an assignment in trust for the employee of the full amount to which the employee is entitled under this section and may bring any legal action necessary to collect the claim.

(e) If the plaintiff prevails in an action for unpaid overtime compensation under (a) of this section, the court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiff unless the defendant shows by clear and convincing evidence that the act or omission giving rise to the action was made in good faith and that the defendant had reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was not in violation of AS 23.10.060, in which case

(j) In a settlement for unpaid overtime compensation that is not supervised by the department or the court, an employee is entitled to liquidated damages under (a) of this section unless the employee and the employer enter into a written settlement agreement in which the employee expressly waives the right to receive liquidated damages. A private written settlement agreement under this subsection is not valid unless submitted to the department for review. The department shall review the agreement and approve it if it is fair to the parties. The department shall approve or deny an agreement within 30 days of receipt. A waiver of liquidated damages may not be a condition of employment.

#### Article 1. Administration.

## Chapter 20. Alaska Employment Security Act.

###### Sec. 23.20.005.   Purpose.

(a) This chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purposes to promote employment security by increasing opportunities for placement through the maintenance of a system of public employment offices and to provide through the accumulation of reserves for the payment of compensation to individuals with respect to their unemployment.

(b) The legislature declares its intention to provide for carrying out the purposes of this chapter in cooperation with the appropriate agencies of other states and the federal government, as part of a nationwide employment security program, and particularly to provide for meeting the requirements of Title III of the Federal Social Security Act, the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 3303 and 3304 (Federal Unemployment Tax Act, Internal Revenue Code), and the Act of Congress approved June 6, 1933, entitled "An Act to provide for the establishment of a national employment system and for cooperation with the states in the promotion of such system, and for other purposes" (cited in this chapter as the Wagner-Peyser Act), and Title IV of the Act of Congress approved June 22, 1944, each as amended, in order to obtain for this state and its citizens the grants and privileges available under the federal Act.  Doubt as to the proper construction of a provision of this chapter shall be resolved in favor of conformity with the requirements of the federal Act.

###### Sec. 23.20.010.   Policy.

As a guide to the interpretation and application of this chapter, the public policy of the state is declared to be as follows: Economic insecurity due to involuntary unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of the state. Involuntary unemployment is, therefore, a subject of general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden and to maintain purchasing power as a factor in stabilizing the economy of the state.  This can be accomplished by encouraging employers to provide more stable employment and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment, from which benefits may be paid for periods of involuntary unemployment.  The legislature, therefore, declares that, in its considered judgment, the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of the state require the enactment of this measure, under the police power of the state, for the operation of public employment service offices and for the establishment of an employment security program to be used for the benefit of eligible unemployed persons.

Upon receipt, the department, or the designee of the department, shall deposit this money to the clearing account. A payment of a refund shall be made from the clearing account.

(d) Expenditures of the money in the benefit account and refunds from the clearing account are not subject to provisions of law requiring specific appropriations or other formal release by state officers of money in their custody.

(e) A balance of money requisitioned from the unemployment trust fund which remains unclaimed or unpaid in the benefit account after the expiration of the period for which the sums were requisitioned shall be deducted from estimates for and may be used for the payment of benefits during succeeding periods, or, in the discretion of the department, shall be redeposited with the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to the credit of this state's account in the unemployment trust fund, as provided in AS 23.20.135.

(f) Money credited to the account of this state in the unemployment trust fund by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States under 42 U.S.C. 1103 (" 903, Social Security Act) may not be requisitioned from this state's account or used except for the payment of benefits and for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this chapter.

This money may also be requisitioned and used for the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of this chapter but only under a specific appropriation by the legislature and only if the expenses are incurred and the money is requisitioned after the enactment of an appropriation law that

(1) specifies the purpose for which the money is appropriated and the amount appropriated;

(2) limits the period within which the money may be obligated to a period ending not more than two years after the date of the enactment of the appropriation law; and

(3) limits the amount that may be obligated during a fiscal year to an amount that does not exceed the amount by which the aggregate of the amounts credited to the account of this state under 42 U.S.C. 1103 (Sec. 903, Social Security Act) during that fiscal year and the 34 preceding fiscal years exceeds the aggregate of the amounts obligated for administration and paid out for benefits and charged against the amounts credited to the account of this state during those 35 fiscal years.

(g) Amounts credited to this state's account in the unemployment trust fund under 42 U.S.C. 1103 (Sec. 903, Social Security Act) that are obligated for administration or paid out for benefits shall be charged against equivalent amounts that were first credited and that are not already so charged.

###### Sec. 23.20.150.   Discontinuance of unemployment trust fund.

(a) To the extent that AS 23.20.130§23.20.140 relate to the unemployment trust fund, they are operative only so long as the unemployment trust fund exists and so long as the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America maintains for the state a separate book account of all funds deposited in it by this state for benefit purposes, together with the state's proportionate share of the earnings of the unemployment trust fund, from which no other state may make withdrawals.

(b) If the unemployment trust fund ceases to exist, or a separate book account is no longer maintained, all money, property, or security in the fund which belongs to the unemployment compensation fund of the state shall be transferred to the treasurer of the unemployment compensation fund, who shall hold, invest, transfer, sell, deposit, and release the money, property, or security in a manner approved by the department in accordance with this chapter.  However, the money shall be invested in bonds or other interest-bearing obligations of the United States and the investments shall be made so that all the assets of the fund are readily convertible into cash when needed for the payment of benefits.  The treasurer may dispose of securities or other property belonging to the unemployment compensation fund only under the direction of the department.

###### Sec. 23.20.155.   Employment security administration fund.

(a) There is created a special fund in the state treasury known as the employment security administration fund.

(b) All money deposited into this fund shall be continuously available to the department for expenditure in accordance with this chapter, and may not lapse at any time or be transferred to any other fund.  All money in this fund, except money received under AS 23.20.145(h), which is received from the federal government or which is appropriated by the state for the purpose described in AS 23.20.100 shall be expended solely for the purpose and in the amount found necessary by the Secretary of Labor for administration of this chapter.

(c) The fund consists of all money appropriated by this state; all money received from the federal government; all money received from another source for that purpose; money received from an agency of the United States or another state as compensation for services or facilities supplied to such agency; amounts received under a surety bond or insurance policy or from other sources for losses sustained by the employment security administration fund or by reason of damage to equipment or supplies purchased from money in the fund; and proceeds realized from the sale or disposition of equipment or supplies which are no longer necessary for the administration of this chapter. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, all money requisitioned and deposited in this fund under AS 23.20.145(h) shall remain part of the unemployment fund and shall be used only in accordance with the conditions specified in AS 23.20.145(f)§(h).

(d) All money in this fund shall be deposited, administered, and disbursed, in the same manner and under the same conditions and requirements provided by law for other special funds in the state treasury.

(e) The commissioner of revenue is liable on the official bond of the commissioner for the faithful performance of the commissioner's duties in connection with the employment security administration fund.  This liability on the official bond exists in addition to liabilities on a separate bond. Money recovered on a surety bond for losses sustained by the employment security administration fund shall be deposited in that fund.

###### Sec. 23.20.160.   Reimbursement of fund.

If money received from the Department of Labor under 42 U.S.C. 501§504 (Title III, Social Security Act), or money granted to this state under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended, or money made available by this state and matched by money granted to this state under the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended, is found by the Secretary of Labor, because of any action or contingency, to have been lost or expended for a purpose other than or in an amount in excess of that found necessary by the Secretary of Labor for the proper administration of this chapter, it is the policy of the state that the money shall be replaced by money appropriated for the purpose from the general fund of the state to the employment security administration fund for expenditures as provided for in AS 23.20.155.  Upon receipt of notice of the finding by the Secretary of Labor, the department shall promptly report the amount required for replacement to the governor and the governor shall at the earliest opportunity submit to the legislature a request for the appropriation of the amount.

#### Article 3. Contributions.

###### Sec. 23.20.165.   Payment of contributions.

(a) Contributions with respect to wages for employment accrue and are payable by an employer for each calendar year in which the employer is subject to this chapter.  Contributions become due and shall be paid by an employer to the department for the fund in accordance with regulations adopted by the department. An employer may not deduct contributions payable by the employer from the wages of an employee.

(b) Contributions with respect to wages paid on or after January 1, 1955, for employment accrue and are payable by an individual who performs service in employment for each calendar year in which the services are subject to this chapter.

(c) The contributions required from each individual, in accordance with regulations adopted by the commissioner, are payable, shall be deducted from the individual's wages by the employer, and shall be held in trust by the employer for the commissioner until the employee contributions are required by regulation to be deposited with the commissioner. These funds are not subject to garnishment or attachment, and in the event of lien, judgment, or bankruptcy proceedings are not considered assets of the employer.  An employer who fails to make the deductions from the wages of employees is liable to the commissioner for the payment of the required contributions.  The contributions shall be collected from the employer in the manner provided for the collection of employer contributions.

(d) If an employer converts to personal use or misappropriates funds so held in trust, the employer shall pay to the commissioner for deposit in the clearing account the amount converted or misappropriated, together with a penalty equal to five times that amount but not less than $25.  In addition, if the conversion or misappropriation is wilful, the employer is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction is punishable by a fine of not more than $200, or by imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or by both.

(e) An employer shall maintain a record of the amount deducted from the wages of each employee and shall furnish a statement of the deductions to each employee at the times and in the manner the department prescribes by regulation.  A deduction may not be made from those wages paid to an employee during a calendar year which are in excess of the wages subject to contributions under AS 23.20.175.  If an employee in the employ of two or more employers earns wages in one calendar year totaling more than the wages subject to contributions or if an employer through error makes a deduction and erroneously pays contributions on wages of an employee in excess of the wages subject to contributions during a calendar year, the amount of deductions in excess of those required by this chapter shall be refunded to the employee by the department upon application for them in accordance with regulations adopted by the department. Application must be made during the calendar year after the calendar year in which the deductions are made.

###### Sec. 23.20.170.   Rate of contributions.

(a)  [Repealed,§80 ch 9 SLA 1980.]

Assignment by the commissioner of employers to industrial classification, for the purposes of this subsection, shall be to the industry group code specified in the most current version of the North American Industry Classification System, United States, in accordance with established classification practices found in the most current version of the North American Industry Classification System manual prepared by the United States Office of Management and Budget.

###### Sec. 23.20.180.   Records and analysis of experience with unemployment risk.

For each calendar year the department shall maintain separate accounts for each employer and claimant to obtain facts and studies upon which the legislature may determine whether an experience rating system should be adopted to require contributions from employers based upon their experience with unemployment risk, and, if so, the most equitable system for accomplishing this purpose consistent with the solvency of the unemployment compensation fund.

###### Sec. 23.20.185.   Interest on past due contributions.

(a) If contributions are not paid on the date on which they are due, the amount remaining unpaid bears interest at the rate of 12 percent per year from the due date until payment plus accrued interest is received by the department.  Interest collected under this section shall be deposited in the clearing account of the unemployment compensation fund.

(b) Interest does not accrue on contributions from an estate in the hands of a receiver, executor, administrator, trustee in bankruptcy, common law assignee, or other liquidating officer after the date when the officer qualifies.  However, contributions accruing with respect to employment of a person by the officer are due and draw interest in the same manner as contributions due from other employers.

(c) Payments of contributions erroneously paid to an unemployment compensation fund of another state which should have been paid to this state and which are refunded by the other state and paid by the employer to this state shall be considered paid to this state at the date of payment of the other state.

(d) Interest collected under this section shall periodically be transferred from the clearing account to the training and building fund.

###### Sec. 23.20.190.   Penalty for failure to file reports.

(a) An employer required to pay contributions under the provisions of AS 23.20.165 who fails to file a contribution report and wage schedule on the date it is due is subject to a penalty, to be assessed and collected in the same manner as contributions.  If the report is filed within 30 days of the date it is due, the penalty is five percent of the contributions due. For each additional 30-day period or its fraction, the penalty is an additional five percent of the contributions due.  However, the penalty may not exceed 25 percent of the contributions due in the aggregate and may not be less than $10 for each reporting period.

(b) If a report is filed after it is due and it is shown to the satisfaction of the department that the failure to file was due to a reasonable cause, a penalty may not be assessed or collected.

(c) Penalties collected under this section shall periodically be transferred from the clearing account to the training and building fund.

(d) An employer who has elected to make reimbursement payments under AS 23.20.277 who fails to file a contribution report and wage schedule on the date it is due is subject to a penalty, to be assessed and collected in the same manner provided under this section for failure to file a contribution report and wage schedule.  If the report is filed not later than 30 days after the date it is due, the penalty is one-tenth of one percent of the total wages paid for the quarter.  For each additional 30-day period or its fraction, the penalty is an additional one-tenth of one percent of the total wages paid for the quarter. However, the penalty may not exceed one-half of one percent of the total wages paid for the quarter in the aggregate and may not be less than $10 for each reporting period.

(e) The department may require an employer who fails to file a contribution report and wage schedule on the date it is due to file a monthly contribution report and wage schedule, with payment, not later than 30 days after the close of each month.  A decision under this subsection shall be reviewed annually under regulations adopted by the department.  The monthly contribution report and wage schedule is subject to the same interest and penalty provisions as provided in this section and in AS 23.20.185.

###### Sec. 23.20.195.   Penalty for nonpayment of contribution.

(b) This penalty does not attach if within 30 days after mailing or personal delivery of the demand, arrangements for payments are made with the department, and payment is made in accordance with the arrangements.

(c) Penalties collected under this section shall periodically be transferred from the clearing account to the training and building fund.

###### Sec. 23.20.200.   Lien.

(a) A claim for contributions, including interest and penalties, not paid when due is a lien in favor of the state against all the real and personal property of the employer.

(b) The claim becomes a lien when the department records a notice of the lien with the recording officer of the recording district in which the property is located. The claim becomes a lien on a motor vehicle when the department files a notice of the lien in the office of the commissioner of administration. Filing or recording of the notice of lien is constructive notice of the lien against the property described in the notice to creditors of the owner, and to subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers.

(c)  [Repealed,§80 ch 9 SLA 1980.]

(d) The department may release a notice of lien by filing or recording a certificate of release in the manner prescribed for the filing or recording of a notice of lien.  The department may not file or record a certificate of release until the amount of contributions, including interest, and penalties and costs, is paid, or until it receives assurance of payment which it considers adequate.

###### Sec. 23.20.205.   Notice of assessment, distraint, seizure, and sale.

(a) If the department finds that a contribution including interest or penalty on the contribution is delinquent, the department may issue a notice of assessment specifying the amount due and may serve it on the delinquent employer. The notice must inform the employer of the department's rights under (c) of this section. A peace officer or an authorized representative of the department may serve the notice personally or the department may mail the notice by certified or registered mail with return receipt requested.

(b) If the notice is served by mail the notice must be deposited in the post office, addressed to the delinquent employer at the employer's last address of record and the postage paid. The date of service is considered to be the day of delivery shown on the delivery receipt.  However, if it appears the addressee is deliberately avoiding service, then the date of service is the day of mailing.

(c) Unless an appeal is filed under AS 23.20.220, if the amount assessed is not paid within 30 days after personal service or mailing of the notice as required by (a) of this section, the department may collect the amount stated in the assessment by the distraint, seizure, and sale of the property, goods, chattels, and effects of the delinquent employer. Goods and property exempt from execution under the laws of this state are exempt from distraint and sale under this section.

###### Sec. 23.20.210.   Inventory and sale.

(a) Upon making a distraint, the department shall seize the property and make an inventory of it.  The department shall mail or personally deliver a copy of the inventory to the owner of the property, and shall specify the time and place when the property is to be sold. Notice specifying the property to be sold and the time and place of sale shall be posted in at least two public places in the recording district of the judicial district where the seizure is made.  The time of sale may not be less than 20 nor more than 30 days from the date of posting the notice.  The department may adjourn the sale from time to time but adjournment may not exceed 90 days in all.  The department or its authorized representative shall conduct the sale.  The property may be sold by parcel or lot at a public auction.  The department may set a minimum price to include the expenses of making the levy and advertising the sale, and if the amount bid for the property at the sale is not equal to the minimum price fixed by the department, the department or its representative may declare the property purchased by the department for the minimum price.  The department shall credit the delinquent account with the amount received at the sale for the property after defraying the costs of distraint, seizure, and sale.  The department may sell the property acquired by it at public or private sale, and shall deposit the amount received in the unemployment compensation fund.

(b) Upon sale of the property, the department shall issue a bill of sale or a deed to the purchaser. The bill of sale or the deed is prima facie evidence of the regularity of the proceedings of the department in making the sale.  The bill of sale or the deed transfers to the purchaser all right, title, and interest of the delinquent employer in the property. The department shall first apply the proceeds of the sale toward reimbursement of the administration fund for the costs of distraint, seizure, and sale and the balance toward satisfaction of the delinquent account. The department shall refund the excess to the delinquent employer.

###### Sec. 23.20.215.   Notice and order to withhold and deliver.

(a) The department may issue a notice and order to withhold and deliver property of any kind to a person or a political subdivision or department of the state when (1) the department has reason to believe that the person, political subdivision, or department possesses property which is due, owing, or the property of another person; and (2) notice and order of assessment has been served, at least 30 days before the issuance of the notice and order to withhold and deliver.

(b) A peace officer or an authorized representative of the department may serve the notice to withhold and deliver.  The person, political subdivision, or department upon whom service is made shall answer the notice within 10 days.

(c) If the person, political subdivision, or department possesses property, credits, or money subject to the claim of the department, it shall deliver the property to the department immediately upon demand.  The department shall hold the property in trust for application on the indebtedness involved or for return, without interest, in accordance with final determination of liability or nonliability, or, in the alternative, there shall be furnished a sufficient bond satisfactory to the department conditioned upon final determination of liability.

(d) If a person fails to answer the order to withhold and deliver within the time prescribed, the superior court in the judicial district in which the order is served may enter a judgment by default against the person for the full amount claimed by the department in the notice to withhold and deliver, together with costs.

###### Sec. 23.20.220.   Appeals.

(a) When a notice of assessment is delivered or mailed to a delinquent employer, the employer may within 30 days file an appeal in writing with the department, stating that the assessment is unjust or incorrect and requesting a hearing on it. The period for filing an appeal may be extended for a reasonable period for good cause. The appeal must set out the reasons the assessment is objected to and the amount of contributions that the employer admits is due, and must be accompanied by a bond or deposit of other security in the amount of the assessment to ensure collection. The department may waive the security requirement if the employer submits proof of solvency or reasonable assurance, as prescribed by regulations, that the contributions, interest, and penalties due are not in jeopardy. If the employer fails to provide the required security, the collection under AS 23.20.205(c) is not stayed. The department shall adopt regulations for procedures for an appeal under this subsection.

(b) If the appeal is accompanied by the required security or the department has waived the security requirement, filing an appeal on a disputed assessment with the department stays the sale provided for in AS 23.20.210 until a final decision on the assessment is made. However, the filing of an appeal does not affect the right of the department to perfect a lien as provided in AS 23.20.200.

(c) After granting the appellant reasonable opportunity for fair hearing, the department shall make a decision on the appeal. The department's decision is final unless the appellant initiates a proceeding for judicial review in the manner provided by AS 23.20.445.

(d) When an order and notice of assessment becomes final, the superior court shall upon application of the department enter a judgment on the amount provided for in the order and notice of assessment.  The judgment has the same effect as a judgment entered in a civil action.

###### Sec. 23.20.225.   Adjustments and refunds.

(a) Within two years after contributions or interest are erroneously paid, an employer who has paid such contributions or interest may file a written petition with the department for an adjustment of the payment as an offset against subsequent contribution payments, or for a refund of the payment when the adjustment as an offset cannot be made.  If the department upon ex parte consideration determines that the contributions or interest were erroneously collected, it shall allow the employer to make an adjustment without interest. For like cause and within the same period, adjustment or refund may be made on the department's own motion.

(b) If the department finds upon ex parte consideration that it cannot determine that an adjustment or refund should be allowed, it shall deny the application and notify the employer in writing. Within 30 days after notification is mailed or delivered to the employer, whichever happens first, the employer may file a petition in writing with the department for a hearing.  However, the right to a hearing does not apply when an assessment has been appealed from and has become final as provided in AS 23.20.220. The petition shall set forth the reasons for granting a hearing and the amount which the petitioner believes should be adjusted or refunded.  If a petition is not filed within the time prescribed, the determination of the department as stated in the notice is final.

(c) After granting the petitioner reasonable opportunity for fair hearing, the department shall make a decision on the petition.  The decision is final unless the petitioner initiates a proceeding for judicial review in the manner provided by AS 23.20.445.

(d) If not later than two years after the date of payment of interest or penalty an employer who has made such a payment determines that it was made erroneously, the employer may file a written petition with the department to have any subsequent amount of interest or penalties which has been, or might be, assessed against the employer, adjusted by the amount of the erroneous payment, or, if it appears that this adjustment would not be feasible within a reasonable time, the employer may request a refund of the erroneous payment.  If the department upon ex parte consideration determines that the payment of interest or penalties, or any portion of it, was erroneous, it shall allow such an employer to make an adjustment in an amount equal to that erroneously paid, without interest, in connection with any subsequent interest or penalty payment which may be due, or, if this adjustment cannot be made, the department shall refund the amount, without interest, from the fund into which the payment was deposited or transferred.  Refunds of interest and penalties erroneously collected may be made from the clearing account of the unemployment compensation fund or from the training and building fund if they were transferred to and deposited in that fund.  Interest and penalty payments may not be refunded from the unemployment compensation fund. If an employer to whom a refund is due does not file a petition for the refund, the department may make an adjustment or refund of interest or penalties on its own initiative for like cause and subject to the same conditions.

(e) The department shall adopt regulations providing for the disposition of excess contributions paid to the unemployment compensation fund under AS 23.20.130 after notice and opportunity for hearing.

###### Sec. 23.20.230.   Arbitrary reports.

If an employing unit fails or neglects to make or file a report or return required by this chapter, the department, upon the basis of knowledge available to it, may arbitrarily make a report on behalf of the employing unit. The report is considered prima facie correct.

###### Sec. 23.20.235.   Jeopardy assessment.

If the department has reason to believe that an employer is insolvent or if the collection of contributions accrued will be jeopardized by delaying collection, the department may make an immediate assessment and may proceed to enforce collection immediately. However, interest does not begin to accrue upon the contribution until the date when the contribution normally becomes delinquent.

###### Sec. 23.20.240.   Collection of delinquent contributions.

(a) If after notice an employer defaults in the payment of contribution or interest, the amount due may be collected by a person authorized by law and authorized by the department, by civil action in the name of the state, or by both methods. The department shall include in the amount due the fees or costs charged the department by the person for the collection of the delinquent amount. An employer who is liable shall pay the cost of the collection, including collection fees charged, and the costs of legal action.

(b) A lien created by this chapter may be foreclosed by decree of the court in the action.

(c) The court shall hear a civil action brought under this section to collect contributions or interest at the earliest possible date and the action is entitled to preference on the calendar of the court over all other civil actions except petitions for judicial review under this chapter and cases arising under the workers' compensation laws of the state.

(d) The courts in this state shall, in the manner provided in this section, entertain actions to collect contributions or interest for which liability has accrued under the employment security law of another state if the other state has a similar provision for actions to collect contributions due this state in its employment security law.

(e) The attorney general may commence action in this state as agent for and on behalf of any other state to enforce judgments and liabilities for unemployment insurance contributions, penalties, interest, and benefit overpayments due such state which extends a like comity to this state if the requesting state agrees to pay the costs which may be assessed by the court against the plaintiff.

(f) In this section, "employer" as defined in AS 23.20.520 also includes an officer or employee of a corporation, a member, manager, or employee of a limited liability company, or a member or employee of a partnership, including a limited partnership and a limited liability partnership, who, as an officer, employee, manager, or member, is under a duty to pay the contributions as required by (a) of this section.

###### Sec. 23.20.242.   Appeals by officer, manager, member, or employee.

The department shall permit each officer or employee of a corporation, member, manager, or employee of a limited liability company, or member or employee of a partnership, including a limited partnership and a limited liability partnership, who is required to pay the contributions and interest owed by the corporation, limited liability company, or partnership, including the limited partnership and the limited liability partnership, under AS 23.20.165§23.20.278 to appeal individually their duty to pay under those sections.

###### Sec. 23.20.245.   Remedies cumulative.

Remedies given to the state under this chapter for the collection of contributions and interest are cumulative.  An action taken by the department may not be construed to be an election on the part of the state to pursue one remedy to the exclusion of another.

###### Sec. 23.20.247.   Employer's security for delinquent contributions.

(a) If the department determines that an employer has been delinquent in paying contributions owed to the fund for two or more calendar quarters, the department may require an employer to deposit and keep on deposit with the department a sum equal to the contributions payable to the fund for the four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the delinquency. If the employer does not have four completed payroll quarters immediately before the delinquency, the department shall estimate the employer's annual contributions, based on contributions payable for the completed payroll quarters. In lieu of the deposit, the department may accept a bond or other security equal in value to the required deposit. The deposit, bond, or other security accepted by the department does not relieve the employer from making contributions to the fund or paying delinquent contributions, interest, and penalties as provided in this chapter. After notice and opportunity for hearing related to the application of the security, the department may immediately apply all or part of the deposit, bond, or other approved security to the employer's delinquent contributions, interest, or penalties arising under this chapter.

(b) Unless precluded by other law, the deposit, bond, or other security accepted by the department shall take priority over all other liens, claims, or encumbrances and shall be exempt from any process, attachment, garnishment, or execution.

(c) If an employer ceases to be an employer subject to this chapter, the department shall, upon receipt of all payments due the fund, refund to the employer the deposits remaining to the employer's credit and shall cancel any bond or other security accepted by the department under this section. The department may return, in whole or part, the deposit, bond, or other security accepted by the department under this section to the employer if the employer is current in paying contributions under this section for eight consecutive quarters.

###### Sec. 23.20.248.   Injunctive relief.

(a) If an employer does not deposit and keep on deposit the security required by the department under AS 23.20.247, the department, through the attorney general, may bring an action in superior court to enjoin the employer from operating any business as an employer within the state until

(1) the employer is current on all final assessments, including interest and penalties made under this chapter; and

(2) if requested, the employer deposits and keeps on deposit the security described in AS 23.20.247 to protect against future failures and to comply with this chapter.

(b) The department may not seek injunctive relief under (a) of this section until the department has given the employer at least 30 days to comply with an order relating to security under AS 23.20.247.

(c) The department may not be required to post a bond for injunctive relief under this section.

###### Sec. 23.20.250.   Lien upon distribution or assignment of assets.

(a) If the assets of an employer are distributed under a court order, including a receivership, probate, legal dissolution, or a similar proceeding, or in the case of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, a composition, or a similar proceeding, contributions which are or which become due are a lien upon all the assets of the employer. The lien is prior to all other liens or claims except a prior tax lien, a lien filed or recorded under AS 23.20.200, or a claim for remuneration of service of not more than $250 to each claimant, earned within six months before the starting of the proceeding.

(b) The existence of a condition of insolvency or the institution of a judicial proceeding for legal dissolution or of a proceeding for distribution of assets causes the lien to attach without action on behalf of the department or the state.

(c) In the event of an employer's adjudication in bankruptcy, judicially-confirmed extension proposal, or composition, under 11 U.S.C. (Federal Bankruptcy Act), contributions that are or become due are entitled to the priority provided under that Act, as amended.

###### Sec. 23.20.255.   Compromise of contributions.

(a) The department may compromise a claim for contributions, interest, or penalties existing or arising under this chapter in any case where collection of the full claim would result in the insolvency of the employing unit or individual from whom the contributions, interest, or penalties are claimed.

(b) If the department compromises a claim, there shall be filed with the department a statement of the amount of contributions, interest, and penalties imposed by law and claimed due, a complete record of the compromise agreement, and the amount actually paid in accordance with the terms of the compromise agreement.

(c) A person who, in connection with a compromise or offer of compromise, wilfully conceals from an officer or employee of the state property belonging to an employing unit or individual liable for contributions, interest, or penalties, or receives, destroys, mutilates, or falsifies a book, document, or record, or makes a false statement under oath relating to the financial condition of the employing unit or individual liable for contributions, upon conviction, is punishable by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or by both.

(d) If the department accepts a compromise, the compromise is final and conclusive at the time stated in it or at the time agreed to, and, except upon showing of fraud, malfeasance, misrepresentation of a material fact, or failure to meet the terms of the compromise, the case may not be reopened as to the matters agreed upon.

###### Sec. 23.20.260.   Liability of successor employer.

(a) The contributions required by this chapter are a lien upon the property of an employer subject to the provisions of the chapter who sells out the business or stock of goods, who quits business, or whose property used or acquired in the business is sold under voluntary conveyance or under foreclosure, execution or attachment, distraint, or other judicial proceeding.

(b) The employer shall file the reports which the department prescribes and pay the contributions required by this chapter with respect to wages payable for employment up to the date of the occurrence of each contingency.

(c) The purchaser or successor in business shall withhold enough purchase money to cover the amount of contributions due and unpaid until the employer produces a receipt from the department showing that the contributions have been paid, or a certificate that no contributions are due.  If the purchaser or successor fails to withhold purchase money as provided, and the contributions are not paid within 10 days, the purchaser or successor is personally liable for the payment of the contributions accrued and unpaid on account of the operation of the business by the former owner.

###### Sec. 23.20.265.   Liability of contractor and principal for contributions.

(a) An employing unit which contracts with or has under it a contractor or subcontractor who is an employer under the provisions of this chapter may not make a payment to the contractor or subcontractor for a debt due until the contractor or subcontractor has paid or furnished a sufficient bond acceptable to the department for payment of contributions, including penalty and interest, due or to become due for personal services which have been performed by individuals for the contractor or subcontractor arising during the course of the employment of the contractor or subcontractor by the employing unit.

(b) Failure to comply with this section makes the employing unit directly liable for the contributions and interest and the department has the remedies of collection against the employing unit under this chapter as though the services in question were performed directly for the employing unit.

(c) Upon request, the department may notify an employing unit of its contractor's or subcontractor's liability for contributions, interest, and penalties under this chapter to allow the employing unit to comply with this section.

###### Sec. 23.20.270.   Limitation of actions and uncollectible accounts.

(a) The department shall begin action for the collection of contributions, including interest and penalties, imposed by this chapter by assessment or suit within five years after a return is filed.  A proceeding for the collection of these amounts may not be begun after the expiration of this period. In case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade contributions, or in the event of a failure to file a return, the contributions may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of the contributions may be begun, at any time.

(b) The department may charge off as uncollectible and no longer an asset of the unemployment compensation fund a delinquent contribution after five years from the date of delinquency, if the department is satisfied that there are no available means by which the contribution may be collected.

###### Sec. 23.20.275.   Service of process.

Process for assessment and collection of contributions may be served inside and outside the state.  In addition to any other method of service provided for in this chapter, service may be made by certified or registered mail.

###### Sec. 23.20.276.   Financing benefits paid to employees of nonprofit organizations; election.

(b) A nonprofit organization described in this section that, under AS 23.20.525(a)(4), is, or becomes, subject to this chapter shall pay contributions under the provisions of AS 23.20.165, unless it elects, in accordance with this section, to pay to the department for the unemployment compensation fund an amount equal to the amount of regular benefits and of one-half of the extended benefits paid, that is attributable to service in the employ of the nonprofit organization, to individuals for weeks of unemployment that begin during the effective period of the election.

(c) A nonprofit organization which is, or becomes, subject to this chapter on January 1, 1972, may elect to become liable for payments in place of contributions for a period of not less than one taxable year beginning with January 1, 1972, if it files with the department a written notice of its election within the 30-day period immediately following January 1, 1972, or within a like period immediately following the date of enactment of this subsection, whichever occurs later.

(d) A nonprofit organization which becomes subject to this chapter after January 1, 1972, may elect to become liable for payments in place of contributions for a period of not less than 12 months beginning with the date on which this subjection begins by filing a written notice of its election with the department not later than 30 days immediately following the date of the determination of the subjection.

(e) A nonprofit organization which makes an election in accordance with (c) or (d) of this section will continue to be liable for payments in place of contributions until it files with the department a written notice terminating its election.  The notice must be filed not later than 30 days before the beginning of the taxable year for which the termination will first be effective.

(f) A nonprofit organization which has been paying contributions under this chapter for a period after January 1, 1972, may change to a reimbursable basis by filing with the department not later than 30 days before the beginning of any taxable year a written notice of election to become liable for payments in place of contributions.  This election is not terminable by the organization for that and the next taxable year.

(g) The department may for good cause extend the period within which a notice of election or a notice of termination must be filed and may permit an election to be retroactive in effect but not any earlier than with respect to benefits paid after December 31, 1971.

(h) The department, in accordance with regulations it adopts, shall notify each nonprofit organization of any determination which it may make of its status as an employer and of the effective date of any election which it makes and of any termination of election. These determinations are subject to reconsideration, appeal, and review in accordance with the provisions of AS 23.20.410§23.20.470.

###### Sec. 23.20.277.   Reimbursement payments by nonprofit organizations, governmental entities, and federally recognized tribes.

(a) Payments in place of contributions by nonprofit organizations shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this section including either (b) or (c) of this section.

(b) At the end of each calendar quarter, or at the end of any other period as determined by the department, the department shall bill each government entity, federally recognized tribe, nonprofit organization, or group of nonprofit organizations that has elected to make payments in place of contributions, for benefits paid during the quarter or other prescribed period that are attributable to service in the employ of the government entity, federally recognized tribe, nonprofit organization, or group. In the case of nonprofit organizations and groups of nonprofit organizations, the amount billed is an amount equal to the full amount of regular benefits plus extended benefits that are not reimbursable by the federal government. In the case of a government entity or federally recognized tribe, the amount billed is an amount equal to the full amount of the regular benefits plus the full amount of the extended benefits paid.

(c) Each nonprofit organization that has elected payments in place of contributions may request permission to make payments as provided in this subsection.  This method of payment becomes effective upon approval by the department.  At the end of each calendar quarter or at the end of any other period as determined by the department, the department shall bill each nonprofit organization for an amount representing one of the following:

(1) that percentage of its total payroll for the immediately preceding calendar year as the department determines; the determination shall be based each year on the average benefit costs attributable to service in the employ of nonprofit organizations during the preceding calendar year;

(2) for any organization that did not pay wages throughout the four calendar quarters of the preceding calendar year, that percentage of its payroll during the year as the department determines.

(d) At the end of each taxable year, the department may modify the quarterly percentage of payroll thereafter payable by the nonprofit organization in order to minimize excess or insufficient payments.

(e) At the end of each taxable year, the department shall determine whether the total of payments for the year made by a nonprofit organization or group of nonprofit organizations is less than, or in excess of, the total amount of regular benefits plus extended benefits not reimbursable by the federal government paid to individuals during the taxable year based on wages attributable to service in the employ of the nonprofit organization or group. In the case of a government entity or federally recognized tribe that has elected to make payments under this section, the department shall determine whether the total of payments for the year is less than, or in excess of, the total amount of regular benefits plus the total amount of extended benefits as determined in this subsection. If total payments for the taxable year are less than the amount so determined, the employer is liable for payment of the unpaid balance to the fund in accordance with (f) of this section. If the total payments exceed the amount so determined for the taxable year, all or part of the excess may, at the discretion of the department, be refunded from the fund or retained in the fund as part of the payments that may be required for the next taxable year.

(f) Payment of any bill rendered under (b) or (c) of this section shall be made not later than 30 days after the bill was mailed to the last known address of the nonprofit organization, group of nonprofit organizations, government entity, or federally recognized tribe or was otherwise delivered to it, unless there has been an application for review and redetermination in accordance with (h) of this section.

(g) Payments made by any nonprofit organization, group of nonprofit organizations, government entity, or federally recognized tribe under the provisions of this section may not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of an individual in the employ of the organization, group of organizations, government entity, or federally recognized tribe; nor may contributions be required of an employee on the basis of wages paid to that employee for services performed by the employee in employment for a nonprofit organization, group of nonprofit organizations, government entity, or federally recognized tribe that makes an election to become liable for payments in place of contributions under AS 23.20.276§23.20.278, and the wages are paid during the period of election.

(h) The amount due, specified in a bill from the department, is conclusive on the employer unless, not later than 30 days after the bill was mailed to its last address of record or otherwise delivered to it, the employer files an application for redetermination by the department, setting out the grounds for the application. The department shall promptly review and reconsider the bill and shall issue a redetermination in any case in which an application for redetermination has been filed. Any redetermination is conclusive on the employer unless, not later than 30 days after the redetermination was mailed to its last address of record or otherwise delivered to it, the employer files an appeal to the commissioner, setting out the grounds for the appeal. Proceedings on appeal to the commissioner from the amount of a bill rendered under this subsection or a redetermination of the amount shall be in accordance with AS 23.20.410§23.20.470.

(i) Past due payments of amounts in place of contributions are subject to the same interest and penalties that, under AS 23.20.185§23.20.195, apply to past due contributions.

(j) At the discretion of the department, a nonprofit organization, group of nonprofit organizations, government entity, or federally recognized tribe that elects to become liable for payments in place of contributions under AS 23.20.276§23.20.278 is required, within 30 days after the effective date of its election, to execute and file with the department a surety bond approved by the department or it may elect instead to deposit with the department money or securities. The amount of the bond or deposit shall be determined by the department in accordance with regulations adopted by the department.

(k) If a nonprofit organization, group of nonprofit organizations, government entity, or federally recognized tribe is delinquent in making payments in place of contributions as required under this section and after having been given notice, the department, after giving notice to the employer who is delinquent, shall terminate that employer's election to make payments in place of contributions until a time provided by regulations adopted by the department.

(l) Each employer that is liable for payments in place of contributions shall pay to the department for the fund the amount of regular benefits plus the extended benefits not reimbursable by the federal government paid to individuals that are attributable to service in the employ of that employer. However, a government entity or federally recognized tribe that has elected to make payments under this section is liable for the amount of regular benefits plus the full amount of extended benefits that are attributable to service in the employ of that entity or tribe. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by more than one employer and one or more of these employers is liable for payments in place of contributions, the amount payable to the fund by each employer that is liable for payments shall be determined by the department in accordance with regulations adopted by the department.

(m) The department may not approve an election to make payments in place of contributions if, at the time of the election, a nonprofit organization, group of nonprofit organizations, government entity, or federally recognized tribe is delinquent in making contributions under AS 23.20.165.

###### Sec. 23.20.278.   Financing benefits paid to employees of the state, political subdivisions of the state, or a federally recognized tribe.

A federally recognized tribe, a political subdivision, or a department, division, or other agency of the state subject to this chapter, under AS 23.20.525(a)(12), shall pay contributions under the provisions of AS 23.20.165, unless it elects to reimburse the department for the unemployment compensation fund according to the provisions applicable to nonprofit organizations, government entities, or federally recognized tribes under AS 23.20.276 and 23.20.277.

###### Sec. 23.20.279.   Prohibition on relief of certain charges to an employer's account.

(a) An employer's account may not be relieved of charges relating to a payment that was made erroneously from the unemployment trust fund account (AS 23.20.135(a)) if the department determines that

(1) the erroneous payment was made because the employer or an agent of the employer was at fault for failing to respond timely or adequately to a documented request from the department for information relating to the claim for unemployment compensation; and

(2) the employer or an agent of the employer has established a pattern of failing to respond timely or adequately to requests under (1) of this subsection.

(b) In this section,

(1) "erroneous payment" means a payment that, but for the failure by the employer or an agent of the employer with respect to the claim for unemployment compensation, would not have been made;

(2) "pattern of failing" means repeated documented failure by the employer or the agent of the employer to respond, taking into consideration the number of instances of failure in relation to the total volume of requests; however, an employer or an agent of the employer that fails to respond as described in (a)(2) of this section may not be determined to have engaged in a pattern of failure if the number of failures during the year before the request is made is fewer than two or the percentage of failures is less than two percent.

#### Article 4. Experience Rating.

###### Sec. 23.20.280.   Eligible employer.

(a) An employer is eligible for a rate determination in accordance with the provisions of AS 23.20.280§23.20.310 and the department regulations if the employer has been subject to this chapter throughout not less than the four consecutive calendar quarters ending with the computation date and remains subject to this chapter into the calendar quarter which immediately precedes the effective date of the rate.  An employer is not eligible for a rate determination under AS 23.20.280§23.20.310 if, with respect to a calendar quarter in or preceding the employer's qualifying period, the employer has failed to file contribution or payroll reports or to pay contributions, interest, and penalties required by this chapter within 60 days after the computation date or within 10 days after the department has mailed the employer written notice of the delinquency or of failure to file reports, or of both, by registered or certified mail to the employer's last address of record, whichever is the later date.

(b) A report made arbitrarily for an employer by the department under AS 23.20.230 does not entitle an employer to a rate determination under AS 23.20.280§23.20.310, but the report may be used to establish a rate determination in the discretion of the commissioner.

(c) An employer who, because of failure to pay contributions or file reports timely, does not qualify for a rate determination under AS 23.20.280§23.20.310 shall pay contributions at the highest rate provided in AS 23.20.280§23.20.310.

###### Sec. 23.20.281.   Ineligible employer.

An employer who has been subject to this chapter less than four calendar quarters immediately preceding the computation date is not entitled to a rate determination under AS 23.20.280§23.20.310 and the employer shall pay contributions at the standard rates specified in AS 23.20.170(b).

###### Sec. 23.20.285.   Quarterly decline quotients.

(a) The department shall determine each eligible employer's contribution rate by the procedures set out in AS 23.20.280§23.20.310.  The department shall put the employer's quarterly payrolls in chronological order beginning with the first calendar quarter in the qualifying period and ending with the last calendar quarter in the period.  If an employer's payroll in a calendar quarter is less than the payroll in the preceding quarter in the qualifying period, the quarterly decline quotient shall be computed to at least nine decimal places by dividing the amount of the decline by the amount of the payroll in the preceding calendar quarter.

(b) For the purpose of computing quarterly decline quotients, the department may, by regulation, prescribe (1) the manner in which wages paid in the form of annual bonuses or other lump-sum payments for service performed over a period of more than three months are apportioned among the calendar quarters of the calendar year in which the service was performed; and (2) the method for making adjustments in quarterly payrolls to eliminate the effect upon quarterly decline quotients resulting from unemployment which would not be compensable by reason of the labor dispute provision of AS 23.20.383.

(c) The department shall determine the sum of each eligible employer's decline quotients and shall weight the sum by adding to it 1.000000000 for each quarter in the employer's qualifying period in which the employer has no payroll, which quarter immediately follows a quarter in which the employer has no payroll.  Each eligible employer's average quarterly decline quotient shall be computed to the ninth decimal place by dividing the sum of the quarterly decline quotients for the employer, weighted when required by this section, by the number of quarters in the employer's qualifying period less one.

###### Sec. 23.20.290.   Rate determination.

(a) The department shall determine each eligible employer's ratable payroll.  The department shall then put all eligible employers in the order of their average quarterly decline quotients beginning with the smallest average decline quotient and shall determine, with respect to each employer, the cumulative ratable payroll during the four consecutive quarters ending with the computation date of the employer together with all employers who precede the employer on the list.

(b) The department shall segregate the employers into groups in accordance with cumulative ratable payroll.  The limits of the groups are those set out in column B of the table in (c) of this section.  Each of these groups shall be identified by the rate class number in column A which is opposite the figures in column B which represent the percentage limits of each group. An employer shall be assigned the experience factor in column C which is opposite the rate class in which the greater part of the employer's ratable payroll falls.  If one-half of the employer's ratable payrolls falls in one class, and one-half in another, the employer shall be assigned to the lower numbered rate class.  An employer may not be assigned to a higher numbered rate class than is assigned to another employer with the same average quarterly decline quotient.

(c) The rate of contributions for each employer is a percentage of the average benefit cost rate multiplied by the employer's experience factor set out in column C of the table in this subsection opposite the employer's applicable rate class set out in column A plus the fund solvency adjustment surcharge required under (f) of this section. That percentage is 76 percent beginning January 1, 2009, and 73 percent beginning January 1, 2010. However, the rate of contributions for an employer may not be less than one percent or more than six and one-half percent. The rate of contributions for an employer in rate class 21 may not be less than 5.4 percent. The rate of contributions for an employer must be rounded to the nearest 1/100th of one percent.

(d) The rate of contributions payable by each employee of an employer who is subject to AS 23.20.165 is a percentage of the average benefit cost rate as determined in (e) of this section rounded to the nearest 1/100th of one percent. That percentage is 24 percent beginning January 1, 2009, and 27 percent beginning January 1, 2010. However, the rate of contributions for an employee may not be less than one-half percent or more than one percent.

(e) The department shall determine the average benefit cost rate as follows:

(1) the department shall determine the amount of benefits paid to insured workers during the last three computation years;

(2) the department shall subtract from the amount determined in (1) of this subsection the amount of any benefits reimbursed to the fund and the amount of interest earned on the trust fund balance during those computation years;

(3) the department shall divide the amount determined in (2) of this subsection by the total wages paid by all employers required to pay contributions under this chapter during the first three of the last four computation years;

(4) the department shall determine the amount of total wages subject to contributions under this chapter paid during the preceding computation years;

(5) the department shall determine the amount of all wages paid to insured workers during the preceding computation year;

(6) the department shall subtract from the amount determined in (5) of this subsection the amount of wages paid during the preceding computation year by employers who elect to reimburse the department under AS 23.20.276 and 23.20.277;

(7) the department shall divide the amount determined in (4) of this subsection by the amount determined in (6) of this subsection; and

(8) the department shall divide the amount determined in (3) of this subsection by the amount determined in (7) of this subsection.

(f) An employer shall pay a fund solvency adjustment surcharge if the reserve rate is less than three percent. The surcharge is a percentage equal to the difference between three percent and the reserve rate, rounded to the nearest 1/100 of one percent. An employer shall receive a fund solvency adjustment credit if the reserve rate is greater than 3.3 percent. The credit is a percentage equal to the difference between 3.3 percent and the reserve rate rounded to the nearest 1/100 of one percent. The solvency surcharge may not be greater than 1.1 percent, and the solvency credit may not be greater than 0.4 percent. However, an employer's fund solvency adjustment surcharge may not increase more than 0.3 percent from one year to the next year.

###### Sec. 23.20.293.   Requirement to notify the department of a business change and acquisitions.

(a) An employing unit that has a change in ownership, management, or control, or that succeeds to or acquires all or part of another employing unit's trade or business, shall notify the department in writing in accordance with regulations adopted by the department.

(b) For the purposes of this section, "a change in ownership, management, or control" means a change of person, entity, or responsible party required by law to pay unemployment insurance contributions.

###### Sec. 23.20.295.   Rates for successors in business.

(a) When an employing unit, whether or not an employer within the meaning of AS 23.20.520, succeeds to or acquires substantially all of the operating assets of an organization, trade, or business of another employing unit which at the time of acquisition was an employer subject to this chapter, the payroll records of the predecessor employer shall be transferred as of the date of acquisition to the successor employer for the purpose of determining an employer's qualifying period and for all other purposes of rate determination.

(b) If the successor employer was an employer subject to this chapter before the date of acquisition, the rate of contributions for the remainder of the calendar year of acquisition is the successor employer's rate for the period immediately preceding the date of acquisition; the rate for the succeeding years is based on the total of the successor employer's payrolls consolidated with those of the predecessor.

(c) If the successor was not an employer before the date of acquisition, the rate is the rate applicable to the predecessor employer for the period immediately preceding the date of acquisition provided there was only one predecessor or there were only predecessors with identical rates.  If the predecessor rates were not identical, the successor's rate is the highest rate applicable to any of the predecessor employers with respect to the period immediately preceding the date of acquisition.

(d) This section does not apply to an acquisition, transfer of a trade or business, or transfer of an employers' workforce conducting the trade or business if the acquisition or transfer is determined by the commissioner

(1) to have been primarily for the purpose of obtaining a more favorable rate of contributions under AS 23.20.280§23.20.310;

(2) to be inequitable to the parties;

(3) to be contrary to the public interest; or

(4) to be a violation of 42 U.S.C. 503(k) (SUTA Dumping Prevention Act of 2004).

###### Sec. 23.20.297.   Special standards addressing transfers of experience and assignment of rates.

(a) The following standards apply regarding assignment of rates and transfers of experience. For the purposes of AS 23.20.295(d)(1) and (4),

(1) if an employer transfers its trade or business, its workforce conducting the trade or business, or a portion of that trade, business, or workforce, to another employer and, at the time of the transfer, there is substantially common ownership, management, or control of the two employers, then the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred trade, business, or workforce is transferred to the employer to whom that trade, business, or workforce is transferred; the rates of both employers are recalculated and made effective immediately upon the date of the transfer;

(2) if a person is not an employer at the time the person acquires the trade, business, or workforce of an employer, the unemployment experience of the acquired trade, business, or workforce may not be transferred to that person if the commissioner finds that the person acquired the trade, business, or workforce in order to obtain a lower rate of contributions; instead, the person is assigned the applicable new employer rate under AS 23.20.170(b).

(b) An employer who knowingly or recklessly violates or attempts to violate, or who advises another employer to violate, (a) of this section or any other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of a contribution rate, or fails to notify the department of a trade, business, or workforce change or acquisition in order to obtain a more favorable rate of contributions, is not eligible for a rate determination under AS 23.20.280§23.20.310. The employer shall pay one of the following as assigned by the department:

(1) contributions at the highest rate provided for the rate year of the violation and for the three succeeding rate years; or

(2) if the employer's trade, business, or workforce is already at the highest rate for the rate year of the violation, contributions at the highest rate for the three succeeding rate years and a cash penalty of two percent of taxable wages for the rate year of the violation and three succeeding rate years.

(c) A person who knowingly or recklessly advises another person or employer to transfer or acquire a trade, business, or workforce under the provisions of this section in order to obtain a more favorable rate of contributions in violation of (a) of this section is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000.

(d) The department may interpret and apply this section in such a manner as to meet the minimum requirements by the United States Department of Labor.

###### Sec. 23.20.299.   Obtaining an unemployment contribution rate by deception.

(a) A person who violates AS 23.20.297(b) or (c) commits the crime of obtaining an unemployment contribution rate by deception.

(b) A person commits the crime of obtaining an unemployment contribution rate by deception in the first degree if the value of the difference between the rate that had been assigned to the trade, business, or workforce and the rate assigned as a result of the violation is $25,000 or more. Obtaining an unemployment contribution rate by deception in the first degree is a class B felony.

(c) A person commits the crime of obtaining an unemployment contribution rate by deception in the second degree if the value of the difference between the rate that had been assigned to the trade, business, or workforce and the rate assigned as a result of the violation is $500 or more but less than $25,000. Obtaining an unemployment contribution rate by deception in the second degree is a class C felony.

(d) A person commits the crime of obtaining an unemployment contribution rate by deception in the third degree if the value of the difference between the rate that had been assigned to the trade, business, or workforce and the rate assigned as a result of the violation is $50 or more but less than $500. Obtaining an unemployment contribution rate by deception in the third degree is a class A misdemeanor.

(e) A person commits the crime of obtaining an unemployment contribution rate by deception in the fourth degree if the value of the difference between the rate that had been assigned to the trade, business, or workforce and the rate assigned as a result of the violation is less than $50.

###### Sec. 23.20.300.   Corrections and adjustments.

Corrections or modifications of an employer's payroll may be taken into account within two years after the computation date for the purpose of a reduction or increase in the employer's rate.  When an adjustment is made in an employer's payroll or in an employer's average quarterly decline quotient after rates have been assigned, the adjustment may not alter the position of another employer on the schedule or the contribution rate of another employer.  The employer for whom the adjustment in decline quotients is made shall be placed in the class in which another employer with the nearest similar average quarterly decline quotient is placed.

###### Sec. 23.20.305.   Application for review.

(a) The department shall promptly notify each employer of the rate of contributions for the employer as determined for a calendar year under AS 23.20.280§23.20.310. The determination becomes conclusive upon the employer unless, within 30 days after the notice is mailed to the employer's last address of record or delivered to the employer, the employer files an application for review and redetermination, setting out the reasons for the application.

(b) If the commissioner grants review, the employer shall be promptly notified and shall be granted a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing. The commissioner shall make a redetermination and shall notify the employer of the redetermination and the reason for it.

(c) If the commissioner denies a review, the commissioner shall notify the employer of the denial and the reasons for the denial.  A redetermination or a denial of review becomes final, unless within 30 days after the notice is mailed to the last address of record of the employer, or delivered to the employer, the employer initiates judicial review in accordance with AS 23.20.445.

(2) for a periodic payment other than a payment made under the Social Security Act, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, or earlier versions of those federal laws, the service performed for an employer by an insured worker after the beginning of the base period or remuneration for those services affects eligibility for, or increases the amount of the pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or similar periodic payment.

###### Sec. 23.20.375.   Filing requirements.

(a) An insured worker is entitled to receive waiting-week credit or benefits for a week of unemployment for which the insured worker has not been disqualified under AS 23.20.360, 23.20.362, 23.20.378§23.20.387, or 23.20.505 if, in accordance with regulations adopted by the department, the insured worker has

The extension of an individual's base period may not exceed four calendar quarters.

(b) The maximum benefits payable as a result of the use of wages earned in a calendar quarter before the individual's current base period as defined in AS 23.20.520 shall be reduced by the amount of benefits paid previously as a result of the use of wages in computing a previous benefit determination.

###### Sec. 23.20.378.   Able to work and available for suitable work.

(a) An insured worker is entitled to receive waiting-week credit or benefits for a week of unemployment if for that week the insured worker is able to work and available for suitable work. An insured worker is not considered available for work unless registered for work in accordance with regulations adopted by the department. An insured worker may not be disqualified for failure to comply with this subsection if

However, an insured worker who has been pursuing an academic education for at least one school term and who was working at least 30 hours a week during a significant portion of the time that the worker was pursuing an academic education is not disqualified for waiting-week credit or benefits under this subsection if the worker's academic schedule does not preclude full-time work in the worker's occupation and if the insured worker became unemployed because the worker was laid off or the worker's job was eliminated. In this subsection,

(1) "pursuing an academic education" means attending an established school in a course of study providing academic instruction of 10 or more credit hours per week, or the equivalent;

(a) An insured worker is disqualified for waiting-week credit or benefits for the first week in which the insured worker is unemployed and for the next five weeks of unemployment following that week if the insured worker

(1) left the insured worker's last suitable work voluntarily without good cause; or

(2) was discharged for misconduct connected with the insured worker's last work.

(b) An insured worker is disqualified for waiting-week credit or benefits for a week and the next five weeks of unemployment following that week if, for that week, the insured worker fails without good cause

(2) to accept suitable work when offered to the insured worker.

(c) The department shall reduce the maximum potential benefits to which an insured worker disqualified under this section would have been entitled by three times the insured worker's weekly benefit amount, excluding the allowance for dependents, or by the amount of unpaid benefits to which the insured worker is entitled, whichever is less.

(d) The disqualification required in (a) and (b) of this section is terminated if the insured worker returns to employment and earns at least eight times the insured worker's weekly benefit amount.

(e) An insured worker is disqualified for waiting-week credit or benefits for the first week in which the insured worker is unemployed and for the next 51 weeks of unemployment following that week or until the individual has worked subsequent to the discharge from work and earned 20 times the insured worker's weekly benefit amount in employment covered under this chapter if the insured worker was discharged for commission of a felony or theft in connection with the work. In addition, the insured worker is not eligible for extended benefits under this chapter until the worker has requalified for benefits by meeting the earnings requirement in this subsection.

(f) In this section,

(1) "alcohol" has the meaning given in AS 23.10.699;

(2) "drugs" has the meaning given in AS 23.10.699;

(a) Benefits are not payable to any individual on the basis of any services, substantially all of which consist of participation in sports or athletic events or training or preparing to so participate, for any week which commences during the period between two successive seasons or similar periods of that sport or athletic event if that individual performed the services in the first of those seasons or similar periods and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the same or similar services in the second of those seasons or similar periods.

(b) Benefits are not payable on the basis of services performed by an alien unless that alien is an individual who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise is permanently residing in the United States under color of law, including an alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1153 or 1182 ("" 203(a)(7) or 212(d)(5), Immigration and Nationality Act).

(c) Benefits may not be refused under (b) of this section unless any data or information required of an individual to determine whether benefits are not payable to the individual because of the individual's alien status is uniformly required of all applicants for benefits and, in the case of an individual whose applications for benefits would otherwise be approved, determination that benefits to that individual are not payable because of the individual's alien status are made only upon a preponderance of the evidence in the record.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of (b) or (c) of this section, any other conditions which may be required under any amendments to 26 U.S.C. 3304(a)(14) for allowing or denying benefits to aliens as a condition of approval of the unemployment insurance laws of this state under 26 U.S.C. 3304 shall be applied in determining eligibility for benefits under this chapter, commencing on the date on which those conditions are required by federal law to be in effect.

(e) Benefits based on service in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution may not be paid to an individual for a week of unemployment which begins during the period between two successive academic years, or during a similar period between two regular terms, whether or not successive, or during a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in the individual's contract, if the individual performs services in the first of those academic years or terms and if there is a contract or reasonable assurance that the individual will perform services in the same or similar capacity for an educational institution in the second of those academic years or terms.

(h) Benefits based on services for an educational institution in other than an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity may not be paid to an individual for a week of unemployment that begins during the period between two successive academic years or terms if the individual performed those services in the first of those academic years or terms and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform those services in the second of those academic years or terms.  If an individual is denied benefits for any week under this subsection and the individual is not later offered an opportunity to perform services for the educational institution in the second academic year or term, the individual is entitled to a retroactive payment of benefits for each week for which the individual filed a timely claim for benefits and for which benefits were denied solely under this subsection.

(i) Benefits based on services described in (e) and (h) of this section may not be paid to an individual for a week that begins during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if the individual performs those services in the period immediately before the vacation period recess and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform those services in the period immediately following the vacation period or holiday recess.

###### Sec. 23.20.383.   Labor dispute disqualification.

(a) An insured worker is disqualified for waiting-week credit or benefits for a week of the insured worker's unemployment if, for that week, the department finds the insured worker's unemployment is due to a stoppage of work caused by a labor dispute at the immediate establishment or other premises at which the insured worker is or was last employed.  For the purposes of this section, each separate department of the same premises which is commonly conducted as a separate business in separate premises is considered a separate establishment or other premises.

(b) This section does not apply if the department finds that

(1) the insured worker was not participating in or directly interested in the labor dispute that caused the insured worker's unemployment, and the insured worker did not belong to a grade or class of workers that, immediately before the commencement of the dispute, had members employed at the premises at which the labor dispute occurred who were participating in or directly interested in the labor dispute; or

(2) the labor dispute is caused by the failure or refusal of the employer to comply with an agreement or contract between the employer and the insured worker, or a state or federal law pertaining to hours, wages, or other conditions of work.

###### Sec. 23.20.385.   Suitable work.

(a) Work may not be considered suitable and benefits may not be denied under a provision of this chapter to an otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions:

(1) if the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute;

(b) In determining whether work is suitable for a claimant and in determining the existence of good cause for leaving or refusing work, the department shall, in addition to determining the existence of any of the conditions specified in (a) of this section, consider the degree of risk to the claimant's health, safety, and morals, the claimant's physical fitness for the work, the claimant's prior training, experience, and earnings, the length of the claimant's unemployment, the prospects for obtaining work at the claimant's highest skill, the distance of the available work from the claimant's residence, the prospects for obtaining local work, and other factors that influence a reasonably prudent person in the claimant's circumstances.

(c) This section shall be given the same meaning as the Secretary of Labor gives to 26 U.S.C. 3304(a)(5) (Internal Revenue Code of 1954).

###### Sec. 23.20.387.   Disqualification for misrepresentation.

(a) An insured worker is disqualified for benefits for the week with respect to which the false statement or misrepresentation was made and for an additional period of not less than six weeks or more than 52 weeks if the department determines that the insured worker has knowingly made a false statement or misrepresentation of a material fact or knowingly failed to report a material fact with intent to obtain or increase benefits under this chapter. The length of the additional disqualification and the beginning date of that disqualification shall be determined by the department according to the circumstances in each case.

(b) A person may not be disqualified from receiving benefits under this section unless there is documented evidence that the person has made a false statement or a misrepresentation as to a material fact or has failed to disclose a material fact. Before a determination of fraudulent misrepresentation or nondisclosure may be made, there must be a preponderance of evidence of an intention to defraud, and the false statement or misrepresentation must be shown to be knowing and to involve a material fact.

###### Sec. 23.20.390.   Recovery of improper payments; penalty.

(a) An individual who receives a sum as benefits from the unemployment compensation fund when not entitled to it under this chapter is liable to the fund for the sum improperly paid to the individual.

(b) The department shall promptly prepare and deliver or mail to the individual at the individual's last address of record a notice of determination of liability declaring that the individual has been determined liable to refund the amount of benefits to which the individual is not entitled. The amount, if not previously collected, shall be deducted from future benefits payable to the individual. However, the department may absolve liability to the fund for repayment of all or a portion of those benefits if the department determines that an individual has died or has acted in good faith in claiming and receiving benefits to which the individual was not entitled and recovery of those benefits would be against equity and good conscience.

(c) For similar cause and in the same manner, a claim by another state for the recovery of sums paid as benefits under an employment security law of the other state is recoverable under this chapter if the sums were obtained by an individual who is not entitled and the other state has a comparable provision in its employment security law for recovery of the sums on behalf of this state.

(d) If paid-out benefit sums have neither been repaid by the recipient nor deducted from benefits payable to the recipient within two years following the last day of the year in which payment was made, the commissioner may declare the sums uncollectible and cancel both the resulting shortage and related records.

(e) An appeal from the determination of liability under this section may be made in the same manner and to the same extent as provided by AS 23.20.340 and 23.20.410§23.20.470 for an appeal relating to a determination in respect to a claim for benefits. If no appeal is taken to the appeal tribunal by the individual within 30 days of the delivery of the notice of determination of liability, or within 30 days of the mailing of the notice of determination, whichever is earlier, the determination of liability is final and the court shall, upon application of the department, enter a judgment in the amount provided by the notice of determination. The judgment has the same effect as a judgment entered in a civil action.

(f) In addition to the liability under (a) of this section for the amount of benefits improperly paid, an individual who is disqualified from receipt of benefits under AS 23.20.387 is liable to the department for a penalty in an amount equal to 50 percent of the benefits that were obtained by knowingly making a false statement or misrepresenting a material fact, or knowingly failing to report a material fact, with the intent to obtain or increase benefits under this chapter. The department shall deposit into the unemployment trust fund account (AS 23.20.135(a)) a minimum of 30 percent of the penalties collected because of benefits that were obtained by knowingly making a false statement or misrepresenting a material fact, or knowingly failing to report a material fact, with the intent to obtain or increase benefits under this chapter.

###### Sec. 23.20.392.   Deductions from back pay awards.

An employer who makes a deduction from a back pay award to an insured worker because of the insured worker's receipt of benefits under this chapter for which the insured worker is ineligible by reason of the back pay award, shall pay into the unemployment trust fund an amount equal to the amount of the deduction.  If an employer making a payment under this section has already reimbursed the department for the benefits under AS 23.20.276 and 23.20.277, the account of the employer shall be properly credited.  The insured worker's liability under AS 23.20.390 shall be reduced by the amount paid by the employer under this section.

###### Sec. 23.20.395.   Waiver of rights void.

(a) An agreement by an individual to waive, release, or commute the individual's right to benefits or any other rights under this chapter is void.

(b) An agreement by an individual in the employ of a person or concern to pay all or a portion of an employer's contributions required under this chapter from the employer is void.

(c) An employer may not make or require or accept a deduction from wages to finance the employer's contributions required from the employer, or require or accept a waiver of any right under this chapter by an employee.  An employer or officer or agent of an employer who violates a provision of this section upon conviction is punishable, for each offense, by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both.

(d) In addition to the issues raised by the determination which is appealed, the tribunal may hear and decide additional issues affecting the claimant's rights to benefits if, by the date of hearing, the department has issued no final determination concerning the additional issues and the parties involved have been notified of the hearing and of the pendency of the additional issues.

###### Sec. 23.20.420.   Hearing procedure and record.

(a) Each party shall be promptly given a reasonable opportunity for fair hearing.

###### Sec. 23.20.435.   Review by department.

(a) An appeal to the department by a party is a matter of right if the decision of the appeal tribunal reverses or modifies the determination of the department, or if a question arising under AS 23.20.383 is presented.

(b) If in a subsequent proceeding the department or an appeal tribunal has serious doubt as to the correctness of a principle previously declared by an appeal tribunal or by the department, or if there is an apparent inconsistency or conflict in final decisions of comparable authority, then the findings of fact in the case may be certified, together with the question of law involved, to the department.  After giving notice and reasonable opportunity for hearing upon the law to all parties to the proceedings, the department shall certify to the appropriate employees or representatives of the department or appeal tribunal and the parties its answer to the question submitted; or the department in its discretion may remove to itself the entire proceeding as provided in AS 23.20.440 and give its decision upon the entire case.

###### Sec. 23.20.530.   Wages defined.

(a) In this chapter, "wages" means all remuneration for service from whatever source, including insured work, noninsured work, or self-employment; commissions, bonuses, back pay, and the cash value of all remuneration in a medium other than cash shall be treated as wages; gratuities customarily received by an individual in the course of service from persons other than the individual's employing unit may be treated as wages received from the employing unit only to the extent the individual reports the gratuities to the employing unit. The reasonable cash value of remuneration in a medium other than cash, and the reasonable amount of gratuities, shall be estimated and determined in accordance with regulations adopted by the department; notwithstanding AS 23.20.350(a), back pay awards shall be allocated to the weeks or quarters with respect to which the pay was earned. If the remuneration of an individual is not based on a fixed period of time or if the individual's wages are paid in irregular intervals or in a manner that does not extend regularly over the period of employment, the wages shall be allocated to weeks or quarters in accordance with regulations adopted by the department. The regulations must, so far as possible, produce results reasonably similar to those that would prevail if the individual's wages were paid at regular intervals. When an employer has filed for bankruptcy, unpaid wages earned for services performed for the employer are considered wages for the quarter in which they were earned.

(b) In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, "wages" does not include

(1) the amount of any payment, including an amount paid by an employing unit for insurance or annuities or into a fund to provide for the payment, to or on behalf of an individual or the individual's dependent under a plan or system established by an employing unit that makes provisions generally for individuals performing service for it, or for such individuals generally and their dependents, or for a class or classes of the individuals and their dependents, on account of

(3) the amount of a payment on account of sickness or accident disability, or medical or hospitalization expenses in connection with sickness or accident disability, by an employing unit to or on behalf of an individual performing service for it after the expiration of six calendar months following the last calendar month in which the individual performed services for the employing unit;

(4) the amount of a payment made by an employing unit to or on behalf of an individual performing services for it or the individual's beneficiary

(A) from or to a trust described in 26 U.S.C. 401(a) (Internal Revenue Code) that is exempt from taxation under 26 U.S.C. 501(a) at the time of the payment, unless the payment is made to an individual performing services for the trust as remuneration for those services and not as a beneficiary of the trust; or

(B) under or to an annuity plan that, at the time of the payment, meets the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(3)§(6);

(5) the amount of a payment made by an employing unit (without deduction from the remuneration of the individual in its employ) of the tax imposed upon an individual in its employ under 26 U.S.C. 3101 (Internal Revenue Code) with respect to service performed;

(6) remuneration paid in a medium other than cash to an individual for service not in the course of the employing unit's trade or business;

(7) the amount of a payment, other than vacation or sick pay, to an individual after the month in which the individual attains the age of 65, if the individual did not perform services for the employing unit in the period for which the payment is made;

(8) dismissal payments that the employing unit is not legally required to make;

(9) the amount of any payment, including any amount paid by an employer into a fund to provide for any such payment, made to or on behalf of an employee under a plan or system established by an employer that makes provision for the employer's employees generally, or for a class or group of the employer's employees, for the purpose of supplementing unemployment benefits;

(10) the amount of a payment made to or on behalf of an employee for subsistence while the employee is employed away from home, but this exemption applies only to that portion of a subsistence payment that does not exceed the actual expenses of the employee while so employed;

(11) compensation received for inactive service performed by a member of the Alaska National Guard or Naval Militia;

(12) the amount of a payment made to or on behalf of an employee or the employee's beneficiary under a cafeteria plan as defined in 26 U.S.C. 125, if the payment would not be treated as wages under this section without regard to the cafeteria plan;

(13) the amount of payment made, or benefit furnished, by the employer under a plan to provide educational assistance to or for the benefit of an employee if, at the time of the payment or the furnishing, it is reasonable to believe that the employee will be able to exclude the payment or benefit from income under 26 U.S.C. 127(b).

###### Sec. 23.25.010.   Liability to employees for defects or insufficiency of machinery.

A person engaged in manufacturing, mining, constructing, building, or other business or occupation carried on by means of machinery or mechanical appliances is liable to an employee or, in the event of the employee's death, to the employee's personal representative for the benefit of the employee's surviving spouse and children, if any, or if none, then for the employee's parents, or, if neither surviving spouse, nor children nor parents, then for the employee's next of kin dependent upon the employee, for all damages that may result from the negligence of any of the employer's officers, agents, or employees, or by reason of defect or insufficiency due to the employer's negligence in the machinery, appliances, and works.

###### Sec. 23.25.020.   Contributory negligence not a defense.

In an action against a master or employer under AS 23.25.010 the fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence does not bar a recovery where the employee's contributory negligence was slight and the negligence of the employer was gross in comparison, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the employee.  All questions of negligence and contributory negligence are for the jury.

###### Sec. 23.25.030.   Contract, insurance, or indemnity is not a defense.

(a) No contract of employment, insurance, relief benefit, indemnity for injury or death entered into by or on behalf of an employee, nor the acceptance of insurance, relief benefit, or indemnity by the person entitled to it constitutes a bar or defense to an action brought to recover damages for personal injuries to or death of the employee.

(b) Upon trial of the action the defendant may set off the sum contributed by the employer toward the insurance, relief benefit, or indemnity paid to the employee, or in case of the employee's death to the employee's personal representative.

(c) Contributions for insurance, relief benefit, or indemnity exacted from or paid by the employee may not be allowed as set off.

###### Sec. 23.25.040.   Prerequisites to maintenance of action.

(a) The Alaska Workers' Compensation Board consists of a southern panel of three members sitting for the first judicial district, two northern panels of three members sitting for the second and fourth judicial districts, five southcentral panels of three members each sitting for the third judicial district, and one panel of three members that may sit in any judicial district. Each panel must include the commissioner of labor and workforce development or a hearing officer designated to represent the commissioner, a representative of industry, and a representative of labor. The latter two members of each panel shall be appointed by the governor and are subject to confirmation by a majority of the members of the legislature in joint session. The board shall by regulation provide procedures to avoid conflicts and the appearance of impropriety in hearings.

(b) The commissioner shall act as chair and executive officer of the board and chair of each panel. The commissioner may designate a representative to act for the commissioner as chair and executive officer of the board. The commissioner may designate hearing officers to serve as chairs of panels for hearing claims.

(c) The governor shall appoint the members of the panels. Each member, except the commissioner of labor and workforce development, serves a term of three years.  The term of a management member and the term of a labor member of each panel may not expire in the same year.

Process and procedure under this chapter shall be as summary and simple as possible. The department, the board or a member of it may for the purposes of this chapter subpoena witnesses, administer or cause to be administered oaths, and may examine or cause to have examined the parts of the books and records of the parties to a proceeding that relate to questions in dispute.

Evidence taken at the hearing is subject to rebuttal upon final hearing before the board.

(k) The board shall notify the contracting agency of the state or of a political subdivision of the state when it revokes the self-insurance certificate of an employer holding a contract with the state or a political subdivision of the state.

The commission does not have jurisdiction in any case that does not arise under this chapter or in any criminal case. On any matter taken to the commission, the decision of the commission is final and conclusive, unless appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court, and shall stand in lieu of the order of the board from which the appeal was taken. Unless reversed by the Alaska Supreme Court, decisions of the commission have the force of legal precedent.

(b) The commission, in its administrative capacity, shall maintain, index, and make available for public inspection the final administrative decisions and orders of the commission and of the board. The chair of the commission may review and circulate among the other members of the relevant commission appeal panel the drafts of the panel's formal decisions and decisions upon reconsideration. The drafts are confidential documents and are not subject to disclosure.

(c) The chair of the commission shall draft and propose, and the commission in its administrative capacity may adopt, regulations implementing the commission's authority and duties under this chapter, including rules of procedure and evidence for proceedings before the commission under this chapter.

(e) The commission, in its administrative capacity, may adopt and alter an official seal and do all things necessary, convenient, or desirable to carry out the powers expressly granted or necessarily implied in this chapter.

###### Sec. 23.30.009.   Powers and duties of the chair of the commission.

(a) The chair of the commission shall exercise general supervision over the office of the commission and over appeals and shall direct the administrative functions of the commission.

###### Sec. 23.30.010.   Coverage.

(a) Except as provided in (b) of this section, compensation or benefits are payable under this chapter for disability or death or the need for medical treatment of an employee if the disability or death of the employee or the employee's need for medical treatment arose out of and in the course of the employment. To establish a presumption under AS 23.30.120(a)(1) that the disability or death or the need for medical treatment arose out of and in the course of the employment, the employee must establish a causal link between the employment and the disability or death or the need for medical treatment. A presumption may be rebutted by a demonstration of substantial evidence that the death or disability or the need for medical treatment did not arise out of and in the course of the employment. When determining whether or not the death or disability or need for medical treatment arose out of and in the course of the employment, the board must evaluate the relative contribution of different causes of the disability or death or the need for medical treatment. Compensation or benefits under this chapter are payable for the disability or death or the need for medical treatment if, in relation to other causes, the employment is the substantial cause of the disability or death or need for medical treatment.

(b) Compensation and benefits under this chapter are not payable for mental injury caused by mental stress, unless it is established that (1) the work stress was extraordinary and unusual in comparison to pressures and tensions experienced by individuals in a comparable work environment; and (2) the work stress was the predominant cause of the mental injury. The amount of work stress shall be measured by actual events. A mental injury is not considered to arise out of and in the course of employment if it results from a disciplinary action, work evaluation, job transfer, layoff, demotion, termination, or similar action taken in good faith by the employer.

###### Sec. 23.30.011.   Extraterritorial coverage.

(a) If an employee, while working outside the territorial limits of this state, suffers an injury on account of which the employee, or in the event of the employee's death, the employee's dependents, would have been entitled to the benefits provided by this chapter had the injury occurred in this state, the employee or, in the event of the employee's death resulting from the injury, the employee's dependents shall be entitled to the benefits provided by this chapter, if at the time of the injury

(1) the employee's employment is principally localized in this state;

(2) the employee is working under a contract of hire made in this state in employment not principally localized in any state;

(3) the employee is working under a contract of hire made in this state in employment principally localized in another state whose workers' compensation law is not applicable to the employee's employer; or

(4) the employee is working under a contract of hire made in this state for employment outside the United States and Canada.

(b) The payment or award of benefits under the workers' compensation law of another state, territory, province, or foreign nation to an employee or the employee's dependents otherwise entitled on account of the injury or death to the benefits under this chapter is not a bar to a claim for benefits under this chapter; however, a claim under this chapter must be filed within the time limits set out in this chapter. If compensation is paid or awarded under this section

(1) the medical and related benefits furnished or paid for by the employer under another workers' compensation law on account of the injury or death shall be credited against the medical and related benefits to which the employee would have been entitled under this chapter had claim been made solely under this chapter;

(2) the amount of all income benefits paid or awarded the employee under another workers' compensation law shall be credited against the total amount of income benefits which would have been due the employee under this chapter had claim been made solely under this chapter;

(3) the total amount of death benefits paid or awarded under another workers' compensation law shall be credited against the total amount of death benefits due under this chapter.

(c) If an employee is entitled to the benefits of this chapter by reason of an injury sustained in this state in employment by an employer who is domiciled in another state and who has not secured the payment of compensation as required by this chapter, the employer or the employer's carrier may file with the board a certificate, issued by the commission or agency of the other state having jurisdiction over workers' compensation claims, certifying that the employer has secured the payment of compensation under the workers' compensation law of the other state and that with respect to that injury the employee is entitled to the benefits provided under that law.  In that event

(1) the filing of the certificate shall constitute an appointment by the employer or the employer's carrier of the board as the employer's agent for acceptance of the service of process in a proceeding brought by the employee or the employee's dependents to enforce the employee's or their rights under this chapter on account of the injury;

(2) the board shall send to the employer or carrier, by registered or certified mail to the address shown on the certificate, a true copy of any notice of claim or other process served on the director by the employee or the employee's dependents in any proceeding brought to enforce the employee's or their rights under this chapter;

(3) if the employer is a qualified self-insurer under the workers' compensation law of the other state, the employer, upon submission of evidence satisfactory to the board of the employer's ability to meet the employer's liability to the employee under this chapter, shall be considered to be a qualified self-insurer under this chapter;

(4) if the employer's liability under the workers' compensation law of another state is insured, the employer's carrier, as to the employee or the employee's dependents only, shall be considered to be an insurer authorized to write insurance under and be subject to this chapter; however, unless its contract with the employer requires it to pay an amount equivalent to the compensation benefits provided by this chapter, its liability for income benefits or medical and related benefits may not exceed the amounts of the benefits for which the insurer would have been liable under the workers' compensation law of the other state;

(5) if the amount for which the employer's insurance is liable under (3) and (4) of this subsection is less than the total of the compensation benefits to which the employee is entitled under this chapter, the board may, if it considers it necessary, require the employer to file security satisfactory to the board to secure the payment of benefits due the employee or the employee's dependents under this chapter; and

(6) upon compliance with the preceding requirements of this subsection, the employer, as to the employee only, shall be considered to have secured the payment of compensation under this chapter.

(d) In this section

(1) "carrier" includes an insurance company licensed to write workers' compensation insurance in a state of the United States or a state or provincial fund that insures employers against their liabilities under a workers' compensation law;

(2) a person's employment is "principally localized" in this or another state when (A) the person's employer has a place of business in this or the other state and the person regularly works at or from that place of business, or (B), if (A) of this paragraph is not applicable, the person is domiciled and spends a substantial part of the person's working time in the service of an employer in this or the other state; an employee whose duties require the employee to travel regularly in the service of an employer in this and one or more other states may, by written agreement with the employer, provide that the employment is principally localized in this or another state, and unless the other state refuses jurisdiction, the agreement shall be given effect under this chapter;

(3) "state" includes a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, or a province of Canada;

(4) "United States" includes only the states of the United States and the District of Columbia;

(5) "workers' compensation law" includes "occupational disease law."

###### Sec. 23.30.012.   Agreements in regard to claims.

(a) At any time after death, or after 30 days subsequent to the date of the injury, the employer and the employee or the beneficiary or beneficiaries, as the case may be, have the right to reach an agreement in regard to a claim for injury or death under this chapter, but a memorandum of the agreement in a form prescribed by the director shall be filed with the division. Otherwise, the agreement is void for any purpose. Except as provided in (b) of this section, an agreement filed with the division discharges the liability of the employer for the compensation, notwithstanding the provisions of AS 23.30.130, 23.30.160, and 23.30.245, and is enforceable as a compensation order.

(b) The agreement shall be reviewed by a panel of the board if the claimant or beneficiary is not represented by an attorney licensed to practice in this state, the beneficiary is a minor or incompetent, or the claimant is waiving future medical benefits. If approved by the board, the agreement is enforceable the same as an order or award of the board and discharges the liability of the employer for the compensation notwithstanding the provisions of AS 23.30.130, 23.30.160, and 23.30.245. The agreement shall be approved by the board only when the terms conform to the provisions of this chapter, and, if it involves or is likely to involve permanent disability, the board may require an impartial medical examination and a hearing in order to determine whether or not to approve the agreement. A lump-sum settlement may be approved when it appears to be to the best interest of the employee or beneficiary or beneficiaries.

###### Sec. 23.30.015.   Compensation where third persons are liable.

(a) If on account of disability or death for which compensation is payable under this chapter the person entitled to the compensation believes that a third person other than the employer or a fellow employee is liable for damages, the person need not elect whether to receive compensation or to recover damages from the third person.

(b) Acceptance of compensation under an award in a compensation order filed by the board operates as an assignment to the employer of all rights of the person entitled to compensation and the personal representative of a deceased employee to recover damages from the third person unless the person or representative entitled to compensation commences an action against the third person within one year after an award.

(c) Payment of compensation into the second-injury fund as a result of death operates as an assignment to the employer of all rights of the representative of the deceased to recover damages from the third person.

(d) An employer under an assignment may either institute proceedings for the recovery of damages or may compromise with a third person, either without or after instituting an action.

(e) An amount recovered by the employer under an assignment, whether by action or compromise, shall be distributed as follows:

(1) the employer shall retain an amount equal to

(A) the expenses incurred by the employer with respect to the action or compromise, including a reasonable attorney fee determined by the board;

(B) the cost of all benefits actually furnished by the employer under this chapter;

(C) all amounts paid as compensation and second-injury fund payments, and if the employer is self-insured or uninsured, all service fees paid under AS 23.05.067;

(D) the present value of all amounts payable later as compensation, computed from a schedule prepared by the board, and the present value of the cost of all benefits to be furnished later under AS 23.30.095 as estimated by the board; the amounts so computed and estimated shall be retained by the employer as a trust fund to pay compensation and the cost of benefits as they become due and to pay any finally remaining excess sum to the person entitled to compensation or to the representative; and

(2) the employer shall pay any excess to the person entitled to compensation or to the representative of that person.

(f) Even if an employee, the employee's representative, or the employer brings an action or settles a claim against the third person, the employer shall pay the benefits and compensation required by this chapter.

(g) If the employee or the employee's representative recovers damages from the third person, the employee or representative shall promptly pay to the employer the total amounts paid by the employer under (e)(1)(A)§(C) of this section insofar as the recovery is sufficient after deducting all litigation costs and expenses. Any excess recovery by the employee or representative shall be credited against any amount payable by the employer thereafter. If the employer is allocated a percentage of fault under AS 09.17.080, the amount due the employer under this subsection shall be reduced by an amount equal to the employer's equitable share of damages assessed under AS 09.17.080(c).

(h) If compromise with a third person is made by the person entitled to compensation or the representative of that person of an amount less than the compensation to which the person or representative would be entitled, the employer is liable for compensation stated in (f) of this section only if the compromise is made with the employer's written approval.

(i) If the employer is insured and the carrier has assumed the payment of compensation, the carrier shall be subrogated to all the rights of the employer.

(j) Notice of the commencement of an action against a third party shall be given to the division and to all interested parties within 30 days.

###### Sec. 23.30.017.   Immunity for third-party design professional.

(a) A person entitled to compensation under this chapter as a result of injury occurring at the job site of a construction project may not bring a civil action to recover damages for that injury against a design professional or an employee of a design professional who provides professional services for the construction project.

(b) This section does not apply to a person receiving compensation under this chapter who is injured at a job site at which the design professional or employee of the design professional

(1) specifically assumed responsibility for job site safety practices under a contract;

(2) actually exercises control over the premises where the injury occurred; or

(3) prepared design plans or specifications, the plans or specifications contributed to the injury, and the plans or specifications were prepared negligently, recklessly, or with intentional misconduct.

(c) In this section,

(1) "design professional" means a person registered under AS 08.48 as an architect, engineer, or land surveyor;

(2) "professional services" means services provided by a design professional that are within the scope of services for which the design professional is registered.

###### Sec. 23.30.020.   Chapter part of contract of hire.

This chapter constitutes part of every contract of hire, express or implied, and every contract of hire shall be construed as an agreement on the part of the employer to pay and on the part of the employee to accept compensation in the manner provided in this chapter for all personal injuries sustained.

###### Sec. 23.30.022.   False statements by employee.

An employee who knowingly makes a false statement in writing as to the employee's physical condition in response to a medical inquiry, or in a medical examination, after a conditional offer of employment may not receive benefits under this chapter if

(1) the employer relied upon the false representation and this reliance was a substantial factor in the hiring; and

(2) there was a causal connection between the false representation and the injury to the employee.

###### Sec. 23.30.025.   Approval and coverage of insurance policies.

(a) An insurer may not enter into or issue a policy of insurance under this chapter until its policy form has been submitted to and approved by the director of the division of insurance. The director of the division of insurance may not approve the policy form of an insurance company until the company files with it the certificate of the director of the division of insurance showing that the company is authorized to transact the business of workers' compensation insurance in the state. The filing of a policy form by an insurance company with the division of workers' compensation for approval constitutes, on the part of the company, a conclusive and unqualified acceptance of the provisions of this chapter, and an agreement by it to be bound by them.

(b) All policies of insurance companies insuring the payment of compensation under this chapter are conclusively presumed to cover all the employees and the entire compensation liability of the insured employer employed at or in connection with the business of the employer carried on, maintained, or operated at the location or locations set forth in such policy or agreement.  A provision in a policy attempting to limit or modify the liability of the company issuing it is wholly void except as provided in this section.

(c) An insurer extending coverage required under this chapter by specifying Alaska in the other states section or similar provision of the insurance policy shall provide notice to the department under AS 23.30.085.

###### Sec. 23.30.030.   Required policy provisions.

A policy of a company insuring the payment of compensation under this chapter is considered to contain the provisions set out in this section.

(1) The insurer assumes in full all the obligations to pay physician's fees, nurse's charges, hospital services, hospital supplies, medicines, prosthetic devices, transportation charges to the nearest point where adequate medical facilities are available, burial expenses, and compensation or death benefits imposed upon the insured under the provisions of this chapter.

(2) The policy is made subject to the provisions of this chapter and its provisions relative to the liability of the insured employer to pay physician's fees, nurse's charges, hospital services, hospital supplies, medicines, prosthetic devices, transportation charges to the nearest point where adequate medical facilities are available, burial expenses, compensation or death benefits to and for said employees or beneficiaries, the acceptance of the liability by the insured employer, the adjustment, trial, and adjudication of claims for the physician's fees, nurse's charges, hospital services, hospital supplies, medicines, prosthetic devices, transportation charges to the nearest point where adequate medical facilities are available, burial expenses, compensation or death benefits, and the liability of the insurer to pay the same are considered a part of this policy contract.

(3) As between the insurer and the employee or the employee's beneficiaries, notice to or knowledge of the occurrence of the injury on the part of the insured employer is notice or knowledge on the part of the insurer; jurisdiction of the insured employer for the purpose of this chapter is jurisdiction of the insurer; and the insurer, in all things, is bound by and subject to the orders, awards, judgments, and decrees made against the insured employer under this chapter.

(4) The insurer will promptly pay to the person entitled to them the benefits conferred by this chapter, including physician's fees, nurse's charges, hospital services, hospital supplies, medicines, prosthetic devices, transportation charges to the nearest point where adequate medical facilities are available, burial expenses, and all installments of compensation or death benefits awarded or agreed upon under this chapter.  The obligation of the insurer is not affected by a default of the insured employer after the injury, or by default in giving a notice required by this policy.  The policy is a direct promise by the insurer to the person entitled to physician's fees, nurse's charges, fees for hospital services, charges for medicines, prosthetic devices, transportation charges to the nearest point where adequate medical facilities are available, and hospital supplies, charges for burial, compensation or death benefits, and is enforceable in the name of that person.  The insurer shall provide claims facilities through its own staffed adjusting facilities located within the state, or by independent, licensed, resident adjusters with power to effect settlement within the state.

(5) A termination of the policy by cancellation is not effective as to the employees of the insured employer covered by it until 20 days after written notice of the termination has been received by the division. If the employer has a contract with the state or a home rule or other political subdivision of the state, and the employer's policy is cancelled due to nonpayment of a premium, the termination of the policy is not effective as to the employees of the insured employer covered by it until 20 days after written notice of the termination has been received by the contracting agency, and the agency has the option of continuing the payments on behalf of the employer in order to keep the policy in force. If, however, the employer has secured insurance with another insurance carrier, cancellation is effective as of the date of the new coverage.

(6) All claims for compensation, death benefits, physician's fees, nurse's charges, hospital services, hospital supplies, medicines, prosthetic devices, transportation charges to the nearest point where adequate medical facilities are available, and burial expenses may be made directly against either the employer or the insurer, or both, and the order or award of the board may be made against either the employer or the insurer or both.

(7) If the insurer fails or refuses to pay a final award or judgment (except during the pendency of an appeal) made against it, or its insured, or if it fails or refuses to comply with a provision of this chapter, the director of the division of insurance shall revoke the approval of the policy form, and may not accept further proofs of insurance from it until it has paid the award or judgment or has complied with the violated provision of this chapter, and has resubmitted its policy form and received the approval of the form by the director of the division of insurance.

(8) An annual insurance premium that exceeds $2,000 may be paid on an installment basis of not fewer than two payments, if requested by the insured. Premiums paid by installment must be structured to reflect seasonal peaks in the basis of the premium. The insurer shall include this provision in the insurance policy in a manner that clearly informs the insured of the provision.

###### Sec. 23.30.035.   Adjustment of insurance rates.

If the provisions of this chapter require insurance rates adjustments, they must be made in strict compliance with the rate regulation provisions of state law.

###### Sec. 23.30.040.   Second injury fund.

(a) There is created a second injury fund, administered by the commissioner.  Money in the second injury fund may only be paid for the benefit of those persons entitled to payment of benefits from the second injury fund under this chapter. Payments from the second injury fund must be made by the commissioner in accordance with the orders and awards of the board.

(b) If an employee suffers a compensable injury that results in temporary total disability, temporary partial disability, permanent partial disability, or permanent total disability, the employer or insurance carrier shall contribute to the second injury fund. The contribution shall be made annually at the time of the report filing required by  AS 23.30.155(m). The amount of the contribution is the product of the compensation to which the employee is entitled for temporary total disability, temporary partial disability, permanent partial disability, or permanent total disability and the applicable contribution rate set out in column A of this subsection. Payment need not be made to the second injury fund if the total contribution under this subsection is less than $20.  By December 15 of each year the commissioner shall determine and make available to the public the applicable contribution rate for the following calendar year according to the reserve rate of the second injury fund in column B of this subsection:

Column B Reserve Rate

Column A Second Injury Fund Contribution Rate(Percent)At Least(Percent)But Less Than(Percent)

6050

55075

475100

3100125

2125150

1150175

0175

(c) If an employee suffers a compensable injury that results in death and the employee is not survived by a widow, widower, child, or dependent relative eligible to receive death benefits under  AS 23.30.215, the employer or insurance carrier shall pay $10,000 to the second injury fund.

(d) The board may refund a payment made into the second injury fund if the employer or insurance carrier shows that it made the payment by mistake or inadvertence, or if it shows there existed at the time of the death of the employee a beneficiary entitled to benefits under  AS 23.30.215.

(e)    [Repealed,§27 ch 93 SLA 1982.]

(f)    [Repealed,§22 ch 91 SLA 2018.]

(g) The attorney general may investigate claims and hire expert witnesses necessary to prevent fraudulent or excessive claims for money in the second injury fund.

(h) Administration expenses of the state under this section and  AS 23.30.205 must be paid from the second injury fund.

(i) The amount of a payment to the second injury fund and the conditions under which a payment is required of an employer or insurance carrier must be in accordance with the version of (b) of this section in effect on the date that the injury to the employee occurred.

###### Sec. 23.30.041.   Rehabilitation and reemployment of injured workers.

(a) The director shall select and employ a reemployment benefits administrator. The director may authorize the administrator to select and employ additional staff. The administrator is in the partially exempt service under  AS 39.25.120.

(b) The administrator shall

(1) enforce regulations adopted by the board to implement this section;

(2) recommend regulations for adoption by the board that establish performance and reporting criteria for rehabilitation specialists;

(3) enforce the quality and effectiveness of reemployment benefits provided for under this section;

(4) review on an annual basis the performance of rehabilitation specialists to determine continued eligibility for delivery of rehabilitation services;

(5) submit to the department, on or before May 1 of each year, a report of reemployment benefits provided under this section for the previous calendar year; the report must include a general section, sections related to each rehabilitation specialist employed under this section, and a statistical summary of all rehabilitation cases, including

(A) the estimated and actual cost of each active rehabilitation plan;

(B) the estimated and actual time of each rehabilitation plan;

(C) a status report on all individuals requesting, waiving, beginning, completing, or terminating a reemployment benefits program including

(i) reasons for denial, waiver, suspension, or termination;

(ii) dates of completion and return to work; and

(iii) other information required by the director;

(D) the cost of reemployment benefits;

(E) status reports of all individuals who successfully completed a reemployment plan that includes

(i) the plan's occupational goal and whether the individual obtained work after completion in the planned or another occupation; and

(ii) the individual's employment status six months, one year, and two years after reemployment plan completion;

(6) maintain a list of rehabilitation specialists who meet the qualifications established under this section;

(7) promote awareness among physicians, adjusters, injured workers, employers, employees, attorneys, training providers, and rehabilitation specialists of the reemployment program established in this subsection.

(c) An employee and an employer may stipulate to the employee's eligibility for reemployment benefits at any time. If an employee suffers a compensable injury and, as a result of the injury, the employee is totally unable, for 45 consecutive days, to return to the employee's employment at the time of injury, the administrator shall notify the employee of the employee's rights under this section within 14 days after the 45th day. If the employee is totally unable to return to the employee's employment for 60 consecutive days as a result of the injury, the employee or employer may request an eligibility evaluation. The administrator may approve the request if the employee's injury may permanently preclude the employee's return to the employee's occupation at the time of the injury. If the employee is totally unable to return to the employee's employment at the time of the injury for 90 consecutive days as a result of the injury, the administrator shall, without a request, order an eligibility evaluation unless a stipulation of eligibility was submitted. If the administrator approves a request or orders an evaluation, the administrator shall, on a rotating and geographic basis, select a rehabilitation specialist from the list maintained under (b)(6) of this section to perform the eligibility evaluation. If the person that employs a rehabilitation specialist selected by the administrator to perform an eligibility evaluation under this subsection is performing any other work on the same workers' compensation claim involving the injured employee, the administrator shall select a different rehabilitation specialist.

(d) Within 30 days after the referral by the administrator, the rehabilitation specialist shall perform the eligibility evaluation and issue a report of findings. The administrator may grant up to an additional 30 days for performance of the eligibility evaluation upon notification of unusual and extenuating circumstances and the rehabilitation specialist's request. Within 14 days after receipt of the report from the rehabilitation specialist, the administrator shall notify the parties of the employee's eligibility for reemployment preparation benefits. Within 10 days after the decision, either party may seek review of the decision by requesting a hearing under  AS 23.30.110. The hearing shall be held within 30 days after it is requested. The board shall uphold the decision of the administrator except for abuse of discretion on the administrator's part.

(e) An employee shall be eligible for benefits under this section upon the employee's written request and by having a physician predict that the employee will have permanent physical capacities that are less than the physical demands of the employee's job as described in the 1993 edition of the United States Department of Labor's "Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles" for

(1) the employee's job at the time of injury; or

(2) other jobs that exist in the labor market that the employee has held or received training for within 10 years before the injury or that the employee has held following the injury for a period long enough to obtain the skills to compete in the labor market, according to specific vocational preparation codes as described in the 1993 edition of the United States Department of Labor's "Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles."

(f) An employee is not eligible for reemployment benefits if

(1) the employer offers employment within the employee's predicted post-injury physical capacities at a wage equivalent to at least the state minimum wage under  AS 23.10.065 or 75 percent of the worker's gross hourly wages at the time of injury, whichever is greater, and the employment prepares the employee to be employable in other jobs that exist in the labor market;

(2) the employee previously declined the development of a reemployment benefits plan under (g) of this section, received a job dislocation benefit under (g)(2) of this section, and returned to work in the same or similar occupation in terms of physical demands required of the employee at the time of the previous injury;

(3) the employee has been previously rehabilitated in a former worker's compensation claim and returned to work in the same or similar occupation in terms of physical demands required of the employee at the time of the previous injury; or

(4) at the time of medical stability, no permanent impairment is identified or expected.

(g) Within 30 days after the employee receives the administrator's notification of eligibility for benefits, an employee shall file a statement under oath with the board, on a form prescribed or approved by the board, to notify the administrator and the employer of the employee's election to either use the reemployment benefits or to accept a job dislocation benefit under (2) of this subsection. The notice of the election is effective upon service to the administrator and the employer. The following apply to an election under this subsection:

(1) an employee who elects to use the reemployment benefits also shall notify the employer of the employee's selection of a rehabilitation specialist who shall provide a complete reemployment benefits plan; failure to give notice of selection of a rehabilitation specialist required by this paragraph constitutes noncooperation under (n) of this section; if the employer disagrees with the employee's choice of rehabilitation specialist to develop the plan and the disagreement cannot be resolved, then the administrator shall assign a rehabilitation specialist; the employer and employee each have one right of refusal of a rehabilitation specialist;

(2) an employee who elects to accept a job dislocation benefit in place of reemployment benefits and who has been given a permanent partial impairment rating by a physician shall be paid

(A) $5,000 if the employee's permanent partial impairment rating is greater than zero and less than 15 percent;

(B) $8,000 if the employee's permanent partial impairment rating is 15 percent or greater but less than 30 percent; or

(C) $13,500 if the employee's permanent partial impairment rating is 30 percent or greater;

(3) the form provided by the division for election must specify that the employee understands the scope of the benefits and rights being waived by the election; the board shall serve a copy of the executed election form on the administrator and the employer within 10 days after receiving the form from the employee; a waiver and election effective under this subsection discharges the employer's liability for the benefits or rights under this section that were not elected; a waiver may not be modified under  AS 23.30.130; the administrator may not accept an election to accept a job dislocation benefit by an employee who has not signed a form that conspicuously notes the benefit being waived.

(h) Within 90 days after the rehabilitation specialist's selection under (g) of this section, the reemployment plan must be formulated and approved. The reemployment plan must require continuous participation by the employee and must maximize the usage of the employee's transferrable skills. The reemployment plan must include at least the following:

(1) a determination of the occupational goal in the labor market;

(2) an inventory of the employee's technical skills, transferrable skills, physical and intellectual capacities, academic achievement, emotional condition, and family support;

(3) a plan to acquire the occupational skills to be employable;

(4) the cost estimate of the reemployment plan, including provider fees; and the cost of tuition, books, tools, and supplies, transportation, temporary lodging, or job modification devices;

(5) the estimated length of time that the plan will take;

(6) the date that the plan will commence;

(7) the estimated time of medical stability as predicted by a treating physician or by a physician who has examined the employee at the request of the employer or the board, or by referral of the treating physician;

(8) a detailed description and plan schedule;

(9) a finding by the rehabilitation specialist that the inventory under (2) of this subsection indicates that the employee can be reasonably expected to satisfactorily complete the plan and perform in a new occupation within the time and cost limitations of the plan; and

(10) a provision requiring that, after a person has been assigned to perform medical management services for an injured employee, the person shall send written notice to the employee, the employer, and the employee's physician explaining in what capacity the person is employed, whom the person represents, and the scope of the services to be provided.

(i) Reemployment benefits shall be selected from the following in a manner that ensures remunerative employability in the shortest possible time:

(1) on the job training;

(2) vocational training;

(3) academic training;

(4) self-employment; or

(5) a combination of (1)§(4) of this subsection.

(j) The employee, rehabilitation specialist, and the employer shall sign the reemployment benefits plan. If the employer and employee fail to agree on a reemployment plan, either party may submit a reemployment plan for approval to the administrator; the administrator shall approve or deny a plan within 14 days after the plan is submitted; within 10 days of the decision, either party may seek review of the decision by requesting a hearing under  AS 23.30.110; the board shall uphold the decision of the administrator unless evidence is submitted supporting an allegation of abuse of discretion on the part of the administrator; the board shall render a decision within 30 days after completion of the hearing.

(k) Benefits related to the reemployment plan may not extend past two years from date of plan approval or acceptance, whichever date occurs first, at which time the benefits expire. If an employee reaches medical stability before completion of the plan, temporary total disability benefits shall cease, and permanent impairment benefits shall then be paid at the employee's temporary total disability rate. If the employee's permanent impairment benefits are exhausted before the completion or termination of the reemployment process, the employer shall provide compensation equal to 70 percent of the employee's spendable weekly wages, but not to exceed 105 percent of the average weekly wage, until the completion or termination of the process, except that any compensation paid under this subsection is reduced by wages earned by the employee while participating in the process to the extent that the wages earned, when combined with the compensation paid under this subsection, exceed the employee's temporary total disability rate. If permanent partial disability or permanent partial impairment benefits have been paid in a lump sum before the employee requested or was found eligible for reemployment benefits, payment of benefits under this subsection is suspended until permanent partial disability or permanent partial impairment benefits would have ceased, had those benefits been paid at the employee's temporary total disability rate, notwithstanding the provisions of  AS 23.30.155(j). A permanent impairment benefit remaining unpaid upon the completion or termination of the plan shall be paid to the employee in a single lump sum. An employee may not be considered permanently totally disabled so long as the employee is involved in the rehabilitation process under this chapter. The fees of the rehabilitation specialist or rehabilitation professional shall be paid by the employer and may not be included in determining the cost of the reemployment plan.

(l) The cost of the reemployment plan incurred under this section shall be the responsibility of the employer, shall be paid on an expense incurred basis, and may not exceed $13,300.

(m) Only a rehabilitation specialist may accept case assignments as a case manager and sign eligibility determinations and reemployment plans. A person who is not a rehabilitation specialist may perform rehabilitation casework if the work is performed under the direct supervision of a rehabilitation specialist employed in the same firm and location.

(n) After the employee has elected to participate in reemployment benefits, if the employer believes the employee has not cooperated, the employer may terminate reemployment benefits on the date of noncooperation. Noncooperation means

(1) unreasonable failure to

(A) keep appointments;

(B) maintain passing grades;

(C) attend designated programs;

(D) maintain contact with the rehabilitation specialist;

(E) cooperate with the rehabilitation specialist in developing a reemployment plan and participating in activities relating to reemployability on a full-time basis;

(F) comply with the employee's responsibilities outlined in the reemployment plan; or

(G) participate in any planned reemployment activity as determined by the administrator; or

(2) failure to give written notice to the employer of the employee's choice of rehabilitation specialists within 30 days after receiving notice of eligibility for benefits from the administrator as required by (g) of this section.

(o) Upon the request of either party, the administrator shall decide whether the employee has not cooperated as provided under (n) of this section. A hearing before the administrator shall be held within 30 days after it is requested. The administrator shall issue a decision within 14 days after the hearing. Within 10 days after the administrator files the decision, either party may seek review of the decision by requesting a hearing under  AS 23.30.110; the board shall uphold the decision of the administrator unless evidence is submitted supporting an allegation of abuse of discretion on the part of the administrator; the board shall render a decision within 30 days after completion of the hearing.

(p) When the United States Department of Labor publishes a new edition, revision, or replacement for the "Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles" referred to in (e) of this section, the director shall, not later than 90 days after the last day of the month in which the new edition, revision, or replacement standard is published, hold an open meeting under  AS 44.62.310 to select the proposed date on which the new edition, revision, or replacement standard will be implemented to make all eligibility determinations required under (e) of this section. The date selected by the department for implementing the new edition, revision, or replacement standard may not be later than 90 days after the last day of the month in which the new edition, revision, or replacement standard is published. After the meeting, the director shall issue a public notice announcing the date selected by the department. The requirements of  AS 44.62.010§ 44.62.300 do not apply to the selection or announcement of the date under this subsection.

(q) Notwithstanding  AS 23.30.012, after medical stability has been determined and a physician has predicted that the employee may have a permanent impairment that may cause the employee to have permanent physical capacities that are less than the physical demands of the employee's job at the time of injury, an employee may waive any benefits or rights under this section, including an eligibility evaluation and benefits related to a reemployment plan. To waive any benefits or rights under this section, an employee must file a statement under oath with the division to notify the parties of the waiver and to specify the scope of benefits or rights that the employee seeks to waive. The statement must be on a form prescribed or approved by the director. The division shall serve the notice of waiver on all parties to the claim within 10 days after filing. The waiver is effective upon service to the party. A waiver effective under this subsection discharges the liability of the employer for the benefits or rights contained in this section. The waiver may not be modified under  AS 23.30.130.

(r) In this section,

(1) "administrator" means the reemployment benefits administrator under (a) of this section;

(2) "employability" means possessing the ability but not necessarily the opportunity to engage in employment that is consistent with the employee's physical status imposed by the compensable injury;

(c) For a person eligible for vocational rehabilitation service under this chapter or AS 23.15.080 who is placed with an employer for service at the request of the rehabilitation administrator or division of vocational rehabilitation to provide on the job training, work readiness, work therapy experience, or work sampling, the liability set out in (a) of this section applies to the state rather than to the employer.  However, an employer may elect to assume the liabilities in (a) of this section.

(d) A contract may not be awarded by the state or a home rule or other political subdivision of the state unless the person to whom the contract is to be awarded has submitted to the contracting agency proof, furnished by the insurance carrier, of current coverage by workers' compensation insurance from an insurance company or association authorized to transact the business of workers' compensation insurance in this state or proof, furnished by the board, of a current certificate of self-insurance from the board.  The person to whom the contract is awarded shall keep the workers' compensation insurance policy in effect during the life of the contract with the state or political subdivision.  If the state or the political subdivision of the state fails to obtain proof of coverage or self-insurance or to protect itself under (e) of this section, and an employee of the contractor is injured during the term of the contract, the state or the political subdivision is liable for workers' compensation to the employee if the employee is unable to recover from the employer because of the employer's lack of financial assets. The state or the political subdivision is not liable, however, to the employee for workers' compensation if the employee can recover from the employer under (a) and (b) of this section.

(e) When a contracting agency of the state or a political subdivision receives notice that the workers' compensation insurance policy of an employer to whom the agency has awarded a contract has been cancelled due to nonpayment of a premium, without being replaced by a comparable policy, the agency may either terminate the contract with the employer or continue the premium payments on behalf of the employer in order to keep the policy in force during the life of the agency's contract.  If the agency chooses to keep the policy in force, it may deduct its payments from the contract price or bring an action against the employer to recover the amount of the payments.  When the contracting agency receives notice that the board has revoked a certificate of self-insurance held by a person to whom a contract has been awarded, the agency may terminate the contract. This subsection does not limit the causes of action or remedies that the state or political subdivision may have against the employer.

(f) In this section,

(1) "contractor" means a person who undertakes by contract performance of certain work for another but does not include a vendor whose primary business is the sale or leasing of tools, equipment, other goods, or property;

(2) "project owner" means a person who, in the course of the person's business, engages the services of a contractor and who enjoys the beneficial use of the work;

(3) "subcontractor" means a person to whom a contractor sublets all or part of the initial undertaking.

###### Sec. 23.30.050.   Employer's liability despite negligence of a third party.

The liability of an employer for medical treatment is not affected by the fact that the employee was injured through the fault or negligence of a third party not in the same employ, until notice of election to sue has been given as required by AS 23.30.015(a) or suit has been brought against the third party without giving notice.  The employer has, however, a cause of action against the third party to recover any amounts paid by the employer for the medical treatment in like manner as provided in AS 23.30.015(b).

###### Sec. 23.30.055.   Exclusiveness of liability.

The liability of an employer prescribed in AS 23.30.045 is exclusive and in place of all other liability of the employer and any fellow employee to the employee, the employee's legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from the employer or fellow employee at law or in admiralty on account of the injury or death. The liability of the employer is exclusive even if the employee's claim is barred under AS 23.30.022. However, if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this chapter, an injured employee or the employee's legal representative in case death results from the injury may elect to claim compensation under this chapter, or to maintain an action against the employer at law or in admiralty for damages on account of the injury or death. In that action, the defendant may not plead as a defense that the injury was caused by the negligence of a fellow servant, or that the employee assumed the risk of the employment, or that the injury was due to the contributory negligence of the employee. In this section, "employer" includes, in addition to the meaning given in AS 23.30.395, a person who, under AS 23.30.045(a), is liable for or potentially liable for securing payment of compensation.

###### Sec. 23.30.060.   Election of direct payment presumed.

(a) An employer is conclusively presumed to have elected to pay compensation directly to employees for injuries sustained arising out of and in the course of the employment according to the provisions of this chapter, until notice in writing of insurance, stating the name and address of the insurance company and the period of insurance, is given to the employee.

(b) The notice shall be posted and kept on the premises of the employer or on the premises where the employer's operations are being carried on in three conspicuous places, at the office of the employer, at the mess house or boarding house if there is one, and in some conspicuous place on the premises or works. The notice must be substantially in the following form, and the signature shall be witnessed by two witnesses:

Employer's Notice of InsuranceTo the employees of the undersigned: You and each of you are herby notified that the undersigned is insured in the  Insurance Company, whose address is  and that the period covered by the insurance is  in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions to pay compensation to employees of the undersigned for injuries received as provided in the Act of the State of Alaska, known as the "Alaska Workers' Compensation Act."

Signed...................Witness:..........................................................................................................

###### Sec. 23.30.065.   Employer's record of injuries.

An employer shall keep a record with respect to an injury to an employee. The record must contain the information of disease, other disability, or death with respect to an injury that the division requires, and must be available to inspection by the division or by a state authority at the times and under the conditions that the department prescribes by regulation.

###### Sec. 23.30.070.   Report of injury to division.

(a) Within 10 days from the date the employer has knowledge of an injury or death or from the date the employer has knowledge of a disease or infection, alleged by the employee or on behalf of the employee to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment, the employer shall file with the division a report setting out

(1) the name, address, and business of the employer;

(2) the name, address, and occupation of the employee;

(3) the cause and nature of the alleged injury or death;

(4) the year, month, day, and hour when and the particular locality where the alleged injury or death occurred; and

(5) the other information that the division may require.

(b) Additional reports with respect to the injury and to the condition of the employee shall be filed by the employer with the division at the times and in the manner that the director prescribes.

(c) A report made under (a) or (b) of this section is not evidence of a fact stated in the report in a proceeding in respect to the injury or death on account of which the report is made.

(d) Filing of the report with the division in a format prescribed by the director, within the time prescribed in (a) or (b) of this section, is compliance with this section.

(e) If the employer or the carrier has been given notice, or the employer, or an agent of the employer in charge of the business in the place where the injury occurred, or the carrier has knowledge of an injury or death of an employee and fails, neglects, or refuses to file a report of it as required by (a) of this section, the limitations in AS 23.30.105(a) of this chapter do not begin to run against the claim of the injured employee or the employee's dependents entitled to compensation, or in favor of either the employer or the carrier, until the report has been furnished as required (a) of this section.

(f) An employer who fails or refuses to file a report required of the employer by this section or who fails or refuses to file the report required by (a) of this section within the time required shall, if so required by the board, pay the employee or the legal representative of the employee or other person entitled to compensation by reason of the employee's injury or death an additional award equal to 20 percent of the amounts that were unpaid when due. The award shall be against either the employer or the insurance carrier, or both.

###### Sec. 23.30.075.   Employer's liability to pay.

(a) An employer under this chapter, unless exempted, shall either insure and keep insured for the employer's liability under this chapter in an insurance company or association duly authorized to transact the business of workers' compensation insurance in this state, or shall furnish the division satisfactory proof of the employer's financial ability to pay directly the compensation provided for. If an employer elects to pay directly, the board may, in its discretion, require the deposit of an acceptable security, indemnity, or bond to secure the payment of compensation liabilities as they are incurred.

(b) If an employer fails to insure and keep insured employees subject to this chapter or fails to obtain a certificate of self-insurance from the division, upon conviction, the court shall impose a fine of $10,000 and may impose a sentence of imprisonment for not more than one year. If an employer is a corporation, all persons who, at the time of the injury or death, had authority to insure the corporation or apply for a certificate of self-insurance, and the person actively in charge of the business of the corporation shall be subject to the penalties prescribed in this subsection and shall be personally, jointly, and severally liable together with the corporation for the payment of all compensation or other benefits for which the corporation is liable under this chapter if the corporation at that time is not insured or qualified as a self-insurer.

###### Sec. 23.30.080.   Employer's failure to insure.

(a) If an employer fails to comply with AS 23.30.075 the employer may not escape liability for personal injury or death sustained by an employee when the injury sustained arises out of and in the usual course of the employment because

(1) the employee assumed the risks inherent to or incidental to or arising out of the employment, or the risks arising from the failure of the employer to provide and maintain a reasonably safe place to work, or the risks arising from the failure of an employer to furnish reasonably safe tools or appliances; or because the employer exercises reasonable care in selecting reasonably competent employees in the business;

(2) the injury was caused by the negligence of a co-employee;

(3) the employee was negligent, unless it appears that the negligence was wilful and with intent to cause the injury or was the result of wilful intoxication on the part of the injured party.

(b) In an action by an employee against an employer for personal injury sustained arising out of and in the course of the employment where the employer has failed to insure or to provide security as required by AS 23.30.075, it is presumed that the injury to the employee was the first result growing out of the negligence of the employer and that the employer's negligence was the proximate cause of the injury; the burden of proof rests upon the employer to rebut this presumption of negligence.

(c) The limits of liability do not apply when an action is brought under this section.

(d) If an employer fails to insure or provide security as required by AS 23.30.075, the board may issue a stop order at the request of the division prohibiting the use of employee labor by the employer until the employer insures or provides security as required by AS 23.30.075. The failure of an employer to file evidence of compliance as required by AS 23.30.085 creates a rebuttable presumption that the employer has failed to insure or provide security as required by AS 23.30.075. If an employer fails to comply with a stop order issued under this section, the board shall assess a civil penalty of $1,000 a day. The employer may not obtain a public contract with the state or a political subdivision of the state for three years following the violation of the stop order.

(e) If a representative of the department investigates an employer's failure to file the evidence of compliance required by AS 23.30.085 and, after investigation, there is substantial evidence that the employer failed to insure or provide security as required by AS 23.30.075, the representative shall inform the employer. The representative may request the director to issue a stop order prohibiting the use of employee labor by the employer until the employer insures or provides security as required by AS 23.30.075. The director may issue a stop order, without a hearing, based on the representative's investigation. The director shall dissolve a stop order issued under this subsection upon receipt of substantial evidence that the employer is insured or has provided security as required by AS 23.30.075(a). If an employer fails to comply with a stop order issued under this subsection, the division may petition the board to assess a civil penalty. The board may assess a civil penalty of $1,000 a day. An employer who is assessed a penalty under this subsection may not obtain a public contract with the state or a political subdivision of the state for the three years following violation of the stop order.

(f) If an employer fails to insure or provide security as required by AS 23.30.075, the division may petition the board to assess a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each employee for each day an employee is employed while the employer failed to insure or provide the security required by AS 23.30.075. The failure of an employer to file evidence of compliance as required by AS 23.30.085 creates a rebuttable presumption that the employer failed to insure or provide security as required by AS 23.30.075.

(g) If an employer fails to pay a civil penalty order issued under (d), (e), or (f) of this section within seven days after the date of service of the order upon the employer, the director may declare the employer in default. The director shall file a certified copy of the penalty order and declaration of default with the clerk of the superior court. The court shall, upon the filing of the copy of the order and declaration, enter judgment for the amount declared in default if it is in accordance with law. Anytime after a declaration of default, the attorney general shall, when requested to do so by the director, take appropriate action to ensure collection of the defaulted payment. Review of the judgment may be had as provided under the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure. Final proceedings to execute the judgment may be had by writ of execution.

###### Sec. 23.30.082.   Workers' compensation benefits guaranty fund.

(a) The workers' compensation benefits guaranty fund is established in the general fund to carry out the purposes of this section. The fund is composed of civil penalty payments made by employers under AS 23.30.080, income earned on investment of the money in the fund, money deposited in the fund by the department, and appropriations to the fund, if any. However, money appropriated to the fund does not lapse. Amounts in the fund may be appropriated for claims against the fund, for expenses directly related to fund operations and claims, and for legal expenses.

(b) Every three months, the Department of Revenue shall provide the division with a statement of the activities of, balances in, interest earned on, and interest returned to the fund.

(c) Subject to the provisions of this section, an employee employed by an employer who fails to meet the requirements of AS 23.30.075 and who fails to pay compensation and benefits due to the employee under this chapter may file a claim for payment by the fund. In order to be eligible for payment, the claim form must be filed within the same time, and in the same manner, as a workers' compensation claim. The fund may assert the same defenses as an insured employer under this chapter.

(d) If the fund pays benefits to an employee under this section, the fund shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the employee to the amount paid, and the employee shall assign all right, title, and interest in that portion of the employee's workers' compensation claim and any recovery under AS 23.30.015 to the fund. Money collected by the division on the claim or recovery shall be deposited in the fund.

(e) If the money deposited in the fund is insufficient at a given time to satisfy a duly authorized claim against the fund, the fund shall, when sufficient money has been deposited in the fund and appropriated, satisfy unpaid claims in the order in which the claims were originally filed, without interest.

(f) The division may contract under AS 36.30 (State Procurement Code) with a person for the person to adjust claims against the fund. The contract may cover one or more claims.

(g) In this section, "fund" means the workers' compensation benefits guaranty fund.

###### Sec. 23.30.085.   Duty of employer to file evidence of compliance.

(a) An employer subject to this chapter, unless exempted, shall initially file evidence of compliance with the insurance provisions of this chapter with the division, in the form prescribed by the director. The employer shall also give evidence of compliance within 10 days after the termination of the employer's insurance by expiration or cancellation. These requirements do not apply to an employer who has certification from the board of the employer's financial ability to pay compensation directly without insurance.

(b) If an employer fails, refuses, or neglects to comply with the provision of this section, the employer shall be subject to the penalties provided in AS 23.30.070 for failure to report accidents; but nothing in this section may be construed to affect the rights conferred upon an injured employee or the employee's beneficiaries under this chapter.

###### Sec. 23.30.090.   Self-insurance certificates.

If an employer has complied with the provisions of this chapter relating to self-insurance and has paid annual service fees assessed under AS 23.05.067, the board shall issue the employer a certificate that shall remain in force for a period fixed by the board. The board may, upon at least 10 days' notice and a hearing, revoke a self-insurance certificate upon satisfactory proof that an employer is no longer entitled to it. After revocation, the board may grant a new certificate to an employer, upon the employer's petition and satisfactory proof of the employer's financial ability as provided in this chapter. An employer authorized as a self-insurer shall provide claims facilities through its own staffed adjusting facilities located within the state, or independent, licensed, resident adjusters with power to effect settlement within the state.

###### Sec. 23.30.092.   Volunteer ambulance attendants', police officers', firefighters', and search and rescue personnel's insurance.

A political subdivision may elect to provide benefits and compensation to its volunteer ambulance attendants, police officers, firefighters, or search and rescue personnel by obtaining insurance that would provide its volunteer ambulance attendants, police officers, firefighters, or search and rescue personnel with benefits and compensation at least equivalent to those conferred upon volunteer ambulance attendants, police officers, firefighters, or search and rescue personnel by this chapter, and the election shall be considered compliance with the coverage and insurance provisions of this chapter. The election shall be made by filing copies of the insurance policy or policies with the commissioner.

###### Sec. 23.30.095.   Medical treatments, services, and examinations.

(a) The employer shall furnish medical, surgical, and other attendance or treatment, nurse and hospital service, medicine, crutches, and apparatus for the period which the nature of the injury or the process of recovery requires, not exceeding two years from and after the date of injury to the employee. However, if the condition requiring the treatment, apparatus, or medicine is a latent one, the two-year period runs from the time the employee has knowledge of the nature of the employee's disability and its relationship to the employment and after disablement.  It shall be additionally provided that, if continued treatment or care or both beyond the two-year period is indicated, the injured employee has the right of review by the board.  The board may authorize continued treatment or care or both as the process of recovery may require. When medical care is required, the injured employee may designate a licensed physician to provide all medical and related benefits. The employee may not make more than one change in the employee's choice of attending physician without the written consent of the employer. Referral to a specialist by the employee's attending physician is not considered a change in physicians. Upon procuring the services of a physician, the injured employee shall give proper notification of the selection to the employer within a reasonable time after first being treated. Notice of a change in the attending physician shall be given before the change.

(b) If the employee is unable to designate a physician and the emergency nature of the injury requires immediate medical care, or if the employee does not desire to designate a physician and so advises the employer, the employer shall designate the physician.  Designation under this subsection, however, does not prevent the employee from subsequently designating a physician for continuance of required medical care.

(c) A claim for medical or surgical treatment, or treatment requiring continuing and multiple treatments of a similar nature, is not valid and enforceable against the employer unless, within 14 days following treatment, the physician or health care provider giving the treatment or the employee receiving it furnishes to the employer and the board notice of the injury and treatment, preferably on a form prescribed by the board.  The board shall, however, excuse the failure to furnish notice within 14 days when it finds it to be in the interest of justice to do so, and it may, upon application by a party in interest, make an award for the reasonable value of the medical or surgical treatment so obtained by the employee. When a claim is made for a course of treatment requiring continuing and multiple treatments of a similar nature, in addition to the notice, the physician or health care provider shall furnish a written treatment plan if the course of treatment will require more frequent outpatient visits than the standard treatment frequency for the nature and degree of the injury and the type of treatments. The treatment plan shall be furnished to the employee and the employer within 14 days after treatment begins. The treatment plan must include objectives, modalities, frequency of treatments, and reasons for the frequency of treatments. If the treatment plan is not furnished as required under this subsection, neither the employer nor the employee may be required to pay for treatments that exceed the frequency standard. The board shall adopt regulations establishing standards for frequency of treatment.

(d) If at any time during the period the employee unreasonably refuses to submit to medical or surgical treatment, the board may by order suspend the payment of further compensation while the refusal continues, and no compensation may be paid at any time during the period of suspension, unless the circumstances justified the refusal.

(e) The employee shall, after an injury, at reasonable times during the continuance of the disability, if requested by the employer or when ordered by the board, submit to an examination by a physician or surgeon of the employer's choice authorized to practice medicine under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the examination occurs, furnished and paid for by the employer. The employer may not make more than one change in the employer's choice of a physician or surgeon without the written consent of the employee. Referral to a specialist by the employer's physician is not considered a change in physicians. An examination requested by the employer not less than 14 days after injury, and every 60 days thereafter, shall be presumed to be reasonable, and the employee shall submit to the examination without further request or order by the board. Unless medically appropriate, the physician shall use existing diagnostic data to complete the examination. Facts relative to the injury or claim communicated to or otherwise learned by a physician or surgeon who may have attended or examined the employee, or who may have been present at an examination are not privileged, either in the hearings provided for in this chapter or an action to recover damages against an employer who is subject to the compensation provisions of this chapter. If an employee refuses to submit to an examination provided for in this section, the employee's rights to compensation shall be suspended until the obstruction or refusal ceases, and the employee's compensation during the period of suspension may, in the discretion of the board or the court determining an action brought for the recovery of damages under this chapter, be forfeited. The board in any case of death may require an autopsy at the expense of the party requesting the autopsy. An autopsy may not be held without notice first being given to the widow or widower or next of kin if they reside in the state or their whereabouts can be reasonably ascertained, of the time and place of the autopsy and reasonable time and opportunity given the widow or widower or next of kin to have a representative present to witness the autopsy. If adequate notice is not given, the findings from the autopsy may be suppressed on motion made to the board or to the superior court, as the case may be.

(f) [Repealed,§74 ch 10 FSSLA 2005.]

(g)  [Repealed,§27 ch 93 SLA 1982.]

(h) Upon the filing with the division by a party in interest of a claim or other pleading, all parties to the proceeding must immediately, or in any event within five days after service of the pleading, send to the division the original signed reports of all physicians relating to the proceedings that they may have in their possession or under their control, and copies of the reports shall be served by the party immediately on any adverse party. There is a continuing duty on all parties to file and serve all the reports during the pendency of the proceeding.

(i) Interference by a person with the selection by an injured employee of an authorized physician to treat the employee, or the improper influencing or attempt by a person to influence a medical opinion of a physician who has treated or examined an injured employee, is a misdemeanor.

(j) The commissioner shall appoint a medical services review committee to assist and advise the department and the board in matters involving the appropriateness, necessity, and cost of medical and related services provided under this chapter. The medical services review committee shall consist of nine members to be appointed by the commissioner as follows:

(1) one member who is a member of the Alaska State Medical Association;

(2) one member who is a member of the Alaska Chiropractic Society;

(3) one member who is a member of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association;

(4) one member who is a health care provider, as defined in AS 09.55.560;

(5) four public members who are not within the definition of "health care provider" in AS 09.55.560; and

(6) one member who is the designee of the commissioner and who shall serve as chair.

(k) In the event of a medical dispute regarding determinations of causation, medical stability, ability to enter a reemployment plan, degree of impairment, functional capacity, the amount and efficacy of the continuance of or necessity of treatment, or compensability between the employee's attending physician and the employer's independent medical evaluation, the board may require that a second independent medical evaluation be conducted by a physician or physicians selected by the board from a list established and maintained by the board. The cost of an examination and medical report shall be paid by the employer. The report of an independent medical examiner shall be furnished to the board and to the parties within 14 days after the examination is concluded. A person may not seek damages from an independent medical examiner caused by the rendering of an opinion or providing testimony under this subsection, except in the event of fraud or gross incompetence.

(l) [Repealed,§74 ch 10 FSSLA 2005.]

(m) [Repealed,§74 ch 10 FSSLA 2005.]

(n) A generic drug product must be used when dispensing a drug product to an employee under this chapter unless the prescribing physician provides justification in writing explaining the medical necessity for the name-brand drug product. The department, by regulation, shall establish a preferred drug list and a procedure for establishing medical necessity to depart from the list and to use a name-brand drug product. In this subsection, "generic drug product" has the meaning given the term "equivalent drug product" in AS 08.80.480.

(o) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, an employer is not liable for palliative care after the date of medical stability unless the palliative care is reasonable and necessary (1) to enable the employee to continue in the employee's employment at the time of treatment, (2) to enable the employee to continue to participate in an approved reemployment plan, or (3) to relieve chronic debilitating pain. A claim for palliative care is not valid and enforceable unless it is accompanied by a certification of the attending physician that the palliative care meets the requirements of this subsection. A claim for palliative care is subject to the requirements of (c)§(n) of this section. If a claim for palliative care is controverted by the employer, the board may require an evaluation under (k) of this section regarding the disputed palliative care. A claim for palliative care may be heard by the board under AS 23.30.110.

###### Sec. 23.30.097.   Fees for medical treatment and services.

(a) All fees and other charges for medical treatment or service are subject to regulation by the board consistent with this section. A fee or other charge for medical treatment or service

(1) rendered in the state may not exceed the lowest of

(A) the usual, customary, and reasonable fees for the treatment or service in the community in which it is rendered, for treatment or service provided on or after December 31, 2010, not to exceed the fees or other charges as specified in the fee schedules established by the medical services review committee and adopted by the board in regulation; the fee schedules must include

(i) a physician fee schedule based on the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' resource-based relative value scale;

(ii) an outpatient and ambulatory surgical center fee schedule based on the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' ambulatory payment classification; and

(iii) an inpatient hospital fee schedule based on the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Medicare severity diagnosis related group;

(B) the fee or charge for the treatment or service when provided to the general public; or

(C) the fee or charge for the treatment or service negotiated by the provider and the employer under (c) of this section;

(2) rendered in another state may not exceed the fee or charge for a treatment or service set by the workers' compensation statutes of the state where the services are rendered.

(b) An employer or group of employers may establish a list of preferred physicians and treatment service providers to provide medical, surgical, and other attendance or treatment services to the employer's employees under this chapter; however,

(1) the employee's right to chose the employee's attending physician under AS 23.30.095(a) is not impaired;

(2) when given to the employee, the employer's preferred physician list must clearly state that the list is voluntary, that the employee's choice is not restricted to the list, that the employee's rights under this chapter are not impaired by choosing an attending physician from the list, and that, if the employee chooses an attending physician from the list, the employee may, in the manner provided in AS 23.30.095, make one change of attending physician, from the list or otherwise; and

(3) establishment of a list of preferred physicians does not affect the employer's choice of physician for an employer medical examination under AS 23.30.095.

(c) An employer or group of employers may negotiate with physicians and other treatment service providers under this chapter to obtain reduced fees and service charges and may take the fees and charges into account when forming a list of preferred physicians and providers. In no event may an employer or group of employers attempt to influence the treatment, medical decisions, or ratings by the physicians in the course of the negotiations of such a preferred physician and provider fee plans.

(d) An employer shall pay an employee's bills for medical treatment under this chapter, excluding prescription charges or transportation for medical treatment, within 30 days after the date that the employer receives the provider's bill or a completed report as required by AS 23.30.095(c), whichever is later.

(e) A physician or other provider of treatment services under this chapter, including hospital services, that submits a bill for medical treatment to the insurer or self-insured employer shall also submit a copy of the bill to the employee to whom the treatment was provided. An employee who notifies the insurer or self-insured employer's adjuster in writing of an overcharge in the bill that was not previously identified by the insurer or self-insured employer's adjuster shall be entitled to a reward equal to 25 percent of the billing reduction or reimbursement achieved due to the employee's report. This reward does not apply to overcharges of an amount under $100 if the insurer or self-insured employer's adjuster elects not to pursue correction of the bill.

(f) An employee may not be required to pay a fee or charge for medical treatment or service provided under this chapter.

(g) Unless the employer controverts a charge, the employer shall reimburse an employee's prescription charges under this chapter within 30 days after the employer receives the health care provider's completed report and an itemization of the prescription charges for the employee. Unless the employer controverts a charge, an employer shall reimburse any transportation expenses for medical treatment under this chapter within 30 days after the employer receives the health care provider's completed report and an itemization of the dates, destination, and transportation expenses for each date of travel for medical treatment. If the employer does not plan to make or does not make payment or reimbursement in full as required by this subsection, the employer shall notify the employee and the employee's health care provider in writing that payment will not be made timely and the reason for the nonpayment. The notification must be provided not later than the date that the payment is due under this subsection.

(h) A provider of medical treatment or services may receive payment for medical treatment and services under this chapter only if the bill for services is received by the employer within 180 days after the later of

(1) the date of service; or

(2) the date that the provider knew of the claim and knew that the claim related to employment.

(i) A provider whose bill has been denied or reduced by the employer may file an appeal with the board within 60 days after receiving notice of the denial or reduction. A provider who fails to file an appeal of a denial or reduction of a bill within the 60-day period waives the right to contest the denial or reduction.

(a) Notice of an injury or death in respect to which compensation is payable under this chapter shall be given within 30 days after the date of such injury or death to the employer.

(b) The notice must be in a format prescribed by the director and contain the name and address of the employee, a statement of the time, place, nature, and cause of the injury or death, and authority to release records of medical treatment for the injury or death, and be signed by the employee or by a person on behalf of the employee, or, in case of death, by a person claiming to be entitled to compensation for the death or by a person on behalf of that person.

(c) Notice shall be given to the employer by delivering it to the employer or by sending it by mail addressed to the employer at the employer's last known place of business. If the employer is a partnership, the notice may be given to a partner, if a limited liability company, the notice may be given to a member, or if a corporation, the notice may be given to an agent or officer on whom legal process may be served or who is in charge of the business in the place where the injury occurred.

(d) Failure to give notice does not bar a claim under this chapter

(1) if the employer, an agent of the employer in charge of the business in the place where the injury occurred, or the carrier had knowledge of the injury or death and the board determines that the employer or carrier has not been prejudiced by failure to give notice;

(2) if the board excuses the failure on the ground that for some satisfactory reason notice could not be given;

(3) unless objection to the failure is raised before the board at the first hearing of a claim for compensation in respect to the injury or death.

###### Sec. 23.30.105.   Time for filing of claims.

(a) The right to compensation for disability under this chapter is barred unless a claim for it is filed within two years after the employee has knowledge of the nature of the employee's disability and its relation to the employment and after disablement. However, the maximum time for filing the claim in any event other than arising out of an occupational disease shall be four years from the date of injury, and the right to compensation for death is barred unless a claim therefor is filed within one year after the death, except that, if payment of compensation has been made without an award on account of the injury or death, a claim may be filed within two years after the date of the last payment of benefits under AS 23.30.041, 23.30.180, 23.30.185, 23.30.190, 23.30.200, or 23.30.215. It is additionally provided that, in the case of latent defects pertinent to and causing compensable disability, the injured employee has full right to claim as shall be determined by the board, time limitations notwithstanding.

(b) Failure to file a claim within the period prescribed in (a) of this section is not a bar to compensation unless objection to the failure is made at the first hearing of the claim in which all parties in interest are given reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard.

(c) If a person who is entitled to compensation under this chapter is mentally incompetent or a minor, the provisions of (a) of this section are not applicable so long as the person has no guardian or other authorized representative, but are applicable in the case of a person who is mentally incompetent or a minor from the date of appointment of a guardian or other representative, or, in the case of a minor, if no guardian is appointed before the person becomes of age, from the date the person becomes of age.

(d) If recovery is denied to a person, in a suit brought at law or in admiralty to recover damages in respect to injury or death, on the ground that the person was an employee and that the defendant is an employer within the meaning of this chapter and that the employer has secured compensation to the employee under this chapter, the limitation of time prescribed in (a) of this section begins to run only from the date of termination of the suit.

###### Sec. 23.30.106.   [Renumbered as AS 23.30.011.]

###### Sec. 23.30.107.   Release of information.

(a) Upon written request, an employee shall provide written authority to the employer, carrier, rehabilitation specialist, or reemployment benefits administrator to obtain medical and rehabilitation information relative to the employee's injury. The request must include notice of the employee's right to file a petition for a protective order with the division and must be served by certified mail to the employee's address on the notice of injury or by hand delivery to the employee. This subsection may not be construed to authorize an employer, carrier, rehabilitation specialist, or reemployment benefits administrator to request medical or other information that is not applicable to the employee's injury.

(b) Medical or rehabilitation records, and the employee's name, address, social security number, electronic mail address, and telephone number contained on any record, in an employee's file maintained by the division or held by the board or the commission are not public records subject to public inspection and copying under AS 40.25.100§40.25.295. This subsection does not prohibit

(1) the reemployment benefits administrator, the division, the board, the commission, or the department from releasing medical or rehabilitation records in an employee's file, without the employee's consent, to a physician providing medical services under AS 23.30.095(k) or 23.30.110(g), a party to a claim filed by the employee, or a governmental agency; or

(2) the quoting or discussing of medical or rehabilitation records contained in an employee's file during a hearing on a claim for compensation or in a decision or order of the board or commission.

(c) The division may not assemble, or provide information respecting, individual records for commercial purposes that are outside the scope of this chapter.

(d) An employee may elect to authorize the disclosure of the employee's name, address, social security number, electronic mail address, and telephone number contained in a record described in (b) of this section by signing a declaration on a form provided by the division.

###### Sec. 23.30.108.   Prehearings on discovery matters; objections to requests for release of information; sanctions for noncompliance.

(a) If an employee objects to a request for written authority under AS 23.30.107, the employee must file a petition with the board seeking a protective order within 14 days after service of the request. If the employee fails to file a petition and fails to deliver the written authority as required by AS 23.30.107 within 14 days after service of the request, the employee's rights to benefits under this chapter are suspended until the written authority is delivered.

(b) If a petition seeking a protective order is filed, the board shall set a prehearing within 21 days after the filing date of the petition. At a prehearing conducted by the board's designee, the board's designee has the authority to resolve disputes concerning the written authority. If the board or the board's designee orders delivery of the written authority and if the employee refuses to deliver it within 10 days after being ordered to do so, the employee's rights to benefits under this chapter are suspended until the written authority is delivered. During any period of suspension under this subsection, the employee's benefits under this chapter are forfeited unless the board, or the court determining an action brought for the recovery of damages under this chapter, determines that good cause existed for the refusal to provide the written authority.

(c) At a prehearing on discovery matters conducted by the board's designee, the board's designee shall direct parties to sign releases or produce documents, or both, if the parties present releases or documents that are likely to lead to admissible evidence relative to an employee's injury. If a party refuses to comply with an order by the board's designee or the board concerning discovery matters, the board may impose appropriate sanctions in addition to any forfeiture of benefits, including dismissing the party's claim, petition, or defense. If a discovery dispute comes before the board for review of a determination by the board's designee, the board may not consider any evidence or argument that was not presented to the board's designee, but shall determine the issue solely on the basis of the written record. The decision by the board on a discovery dispute shall be made within 30 days. The board shall uphold the designee's decision except when the board's designee's determination is an abuse of discretion.

(d) If the employee files a petition seeking a protective order to recover medical and rehabilitation information that has been provided but is not related to the employee's injury, and the board or the board's designee grants the protective order, the board or the board's designee granting the protective order shall direct the division, the board, the commission, and the parties to return to the employee, as soon as practicable following the issuance of the protective order, all medical and rehabilitation information, including copies, in their possession that is unrelated to the employee's injury under the protective order.

(e) If the board or the board's designee limits the medical or rehabilitation information that may be used by the parties to a claim, either by an order on the record or by issuing a written order, the division, the board, the commission, and a party to the claim may request and an employee shall provide or authorize the production of medical or rehabilitation information only to the extent of the limitations of the order. If information has been produced that is outside of the limits designated in the order, the board or the board's designee shall direct the party in possession of the information to return the information to the employee as soon as practicable following the issuance of the order.

###### Sec. 23.30.110.   Procedure on claims.

(a) Subject to the provisions of AS 23.30.105, a claim for compensation may be filed with the board in accordance with its regulations at any time after the first seven days of disability following an injury, or at any time after death, and the board may hear and determine all questions in respect to the claim.

(b) Within 10 days after a claim is filed the board, in accordance with its regulations, shall notify the employer and any other person, other than the claimant, whom the board considers an interested party that a claim has been filed.  The notice may be served personally upon the employer or other person, or sent by registered mail.

(c) Before a hearing is scheduled, the party seeking a hearing shall file a request for a hearing together with an affidavit stating that the party has completed necessary discovery, obtained necessary evidence, and is prepared for the hearing. An opposing party shall have 10 days after the hearing request is filed to file a response. If a party opposes the hearing request, the board or a board designee shall within 30 days of the filing of the opposition conduct a pre-hearing conference and set a hearing date. If opposition is not filed, a hearing shall be scheduled no later than 60 days after the receipt of the hearing request. The board shall give each party at least 10 days' notice of the hearing, either personally or by certified mail. After a hearing has been scheduled, the parties may not stipulate to change the hearing date or to cancel, postpone, or continue the hearing, except for good cause as determined by the board. After completion of the hearing the board shall close the hearing record. If a settlement agreement is reached by the parties less than 14 days before the hearing, the parties shall appear at the time of the scheduled hearing to state the terms of the settlement agreement. Within 30 days after the hearing record closes, the board shall file its decision. If the employer controverts a claim on a board-prescribed controversion notice and the employee does not request a hearing within two years following the filing of the controversion notice, the claim is denied.

(d) At the hearing the claimant and the employer may each present evidence in respect to the claim and may be represented by any person authorized in writing for that purpose.

(e) The order rejecting the claim or making the award, referred to in this chapter as a compensation order, shall be filed in the office of the board, and a copy of it shall be sent by registered mail to the claimant and to the employer at the last known address of each.

(f) An award of compensation for disability may be made after the death of an injured employee.

(g) An injured employee claiming or entitled to compensation shall submit to the physical examination by a duly qualified physician which the board may require.  The place or places shall be reasonably convenient for the employee.  The physician or physicians as the employee, employer, or carrier may select and pay for may participate in an examination if the employee, employer, or carrier so requests. Proceedings shall be suspended and no compensation may be payable for a period during which the employee refuses to submit to examination.

(h) The filing of a hearing request under (c) of this section suspends the running of the two-year time period specified in (c) of this section. However, if the employee subsequently requests a continuance of the hearing and the request is approved by the board, the granting of the continuance renders the request for hearing inoperative, and the two-year time period specified in (c) of this section continues to run again from the date of the board's notice to the employee of the board's granting of the continuance and of its effect. If the employee fails to again request a hearing before the conclusion of the two-year time period in (c) of this section, the claim is denied.

###### Sec. 23.30.115.   Attendance and fees of witnesses.

(a) A person is not required to attend as a witness in a proceeding before the board at a place more than 100 miles from the person's place of residence, unless the person's lawful mileage and fee for one day's attendance is first paid or tendered to the person; but the testimony of a witness may be taken by deposition or interrogatories according to the Rules of Civil Procedure.

(b) A witness summoned in a proceeding before the board or whose deposition is taken shall receive the same fees and mileage as a witness in the superior court.

###### Sec. 23.30.120.   Presumptions.

(1) the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter;

(2) sufficient notice of the claim has been given;

(3) the injury was not proximately caused by the intoxication of the injured employee or proximately caused by the employee being under the influence of drugs unless the drugs were taken as prescribed by the employee's physician;

(c) The presumption of compensability established in (a) of this section does not apply to a mental injury resulting from work-related stress.

###### Sec. 23.30.121.   Presumption of coverage for disability from diseases for certain firefighters.

(a) There is a presumption that a claim for compensation for disability as a result of the diseases described in (b) of this section for the occupations listed under (b) of this section is within the provisions of this chapter. This presumption of coverage may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. The evidence may include the use of tobacco products, physical fitness and weight, lifestyle, hereditary factors, and exposure from other employment or nonemployment activities.

(b) For a firefighter covered under AS 23.30.243,

(1) there is a presumption that a claim for compensation for disability as a result of the following diseases is within the provisions of this chapter:

(2) notwithstanding AS 23.30.100(a), following termination of service, the presumption established in (1) of this subsection extends to the firefighter for a period of three calendar months for each year of requisite service but may not extend more than 60 calendar months following the last date of employment;

(3) the presumption established in (1) of this subsection applies only to an active or former firefighter who has a disease described in (1) of this subsection that develops or manifests itself after the firefighter has served in the state for at least seven years and who (A) was given a qualifying medical examination upon becoming a firefighter that did not show evidence of the disease;

(B) was given an annual medical exam during each of the first seven years of employment that did not show evidence of the disease; and

(C) with regard to diseases described in (1)(C) of this subsection, demonstrates that, while in the course of employment as a firefighter, the firefighter was exposed to a known carcinogen, as defined by the International Agency for Research on Cancer or the National Toxicology Program, and the carcinogen is associated with a disabling cancer.

(c) The presumption set out in this section applies only to a firefighter who, at a minimum, holds a certificate as a Firefighter I by the Department of Public Safety under firefighter testing and certification standards established by the department under authority of AS 18.70.350(1) or other applicable statutory authority.

(d) The provisions of (b)(1)(A) and (B) of this section do not apply to a firefighter who develops a cardiovascular or lung condition and who has a history of tobacco product use as established under (e)(2) of this section.

(B) a person registered for purposes of workers' compensation with the state fire marshal as a member of a volunteer fire department.

###### Sec. 23.30.122.   Credibility of witnesses.

The board has the sole power to determine the credibility of a witness.  A finding by the board concerning the weight to be accorded a witness's testimony, including medical testimony and reports, is conclusive even if the evidence is conflicting or susceptible to contrary conclusions.  The findings of the board are subject to the same standard of review as a jury's finding in a civil action.

###### Sec. 23.30.125.   Administrative review of compensation order.

(a) A compensation order becomes effective when filed with the office of the board as provided in AS 23.30.110, and, unless proceedings to reconsider, suspend, or set aside the order are instituted as provided in this chapter, the order becomes final on the 31st day after it is filed.

(b) Notwithstanding other provisions of law, a decision or order of the board is subject to review by the commission as provided in this chapter.

(c) If a compensation order is not in accordance with law or fact, the order may be suspended or set aside, in whole or in part, through proceedings in the commission brought by a party in interest against all other parties to the proceedings before the board. The payment of the amounts required by an award may not be stayed pending a final decision in the proceeding unless, upon application for a stay, the commission, on hearing, after not less than three days' notice to the parties in interest, allows the stay of payment, in whole or in part, where the party filing the application would otherwise suffer irreparable damage. Continuing future periodic compensation payments may not be stayed without a showing by the appellant of irreparable damage and the existence of the probability of the merits of the appeal being decided adversely to the recipient of the compensation payments. The order of the commission allowing a stay must contain a specific finding, based upon evidence submitted to the commission and identified by reference to the evidence, that irreparable damage would result to the party applying for a stay and specifying the nature of the damage.

(d) Proceedings for reconsidering, suspending, setting aside, or enforcing a compensation order, whether rejecting a claim or making an award, may not be instituted, except as provided in this chapter.

###### Sec. 23.30.127.   Appeals to commission.

(a) A party in interest may appeal a compensation order issued by the board to the commission within 30 days after the compensation order is filed with the office of the board under AS 23.30.110. The director may intervene in an appeal. If a party in interest is not represented by counsel and the compensation order concerns an unsettled question of law, the director may file an appeal to obtain a ruling on the question by the commission.

(b) An appeal is initiated by filing with the office of the commission

(1) a signed notice of appeal specifying the compensation order appealed from;

(2) a statement of the grounds upon which the appeal is taken; and

(3) other material the commission may by regulation require.

(c) A cross-appeal may be initiated by filing with the office of the commission a signed notice of cross-appeal within 30 days after the decision is filed or within 15 days after service of notice of an appeal, whichever is later. The notice of cross-appeal shall specify the compensation order appealed from and the grounds upon which the cross-appeal is taken.

(d) The office of the commission may charge a fee, not to exceed $100, for filing appeals and cross-appeals, except that the office of the commission may not charge a fee if the appellant is the state or a political subdivision of the state. The commission may require an appellant to pay the costs of the transcript of hearing and the preparation of the record on appeal. The commission may require cross-appellants or intervenors to share in the costs.

(e) If a request for reconsideration of a board decision was timely filed with the office of the board, the notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after the reconsideration decision is mailed to the parties or the date the request for reconsideration is considered denied in the absence of any action on the request, whichever is earlier.

(f) The commission may require written briefs and make other rules and orders to facilitate the business of the commission and advance the prompt, fair, and just disposition of appeals.

###### Sec. 23.30.128.   Commission proceedings.

(a) An appeal from a decision of the board under this chapter, and other proceedings under this section, shall be heard and decided by a three-member panel of the commission. An appeal panel of the commission must include the chair of the commission. The chair of the commission shall assign two members to each appeal, including one commission member classified as representing employees and one commission member classified as representing employers. Acts, decisions, and orders of the commission panel in the appeal or related proceeding shall be considered the acts, decisions, and orders of the full commission. The matter on appeal shall be decided on the record made before the board, a transcript or recording of the proceedings before the board, and oral argument and written briefs allowed by the commission. Except as provided in (c) of this section, new or additional evidence may not be received with respect to the appeal.

(b) The commission may review discretionary actions, findings of fact, and conclusions of law by the board in hearing, determining, or otherwise acting on a compensation claim or petition. The board's findings regarding the credibility of testimony of a witness before the board are binding on the commission. The board's findings of fact shall be upheld by the commission if supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record. In reviewing questions of law and procedure, the commission shall exercise its independent judgment.

(c) The commission may hold hearings and receive evidence on applications for (1) stays under AS 23.30.125; (2) attorney fees and costs of appeal; (3) waiver of fees by indigent appellants; or (4) dismissal of appeals for failure to prosecute or upon settlement. The commission may rely on new or additional evidence presented during the hearing in making its decision on the application.

(d) The commission may affirm, reverse, or modify a decision or order upon review and issue other orders as appropriate. The commission may remand matters it determines were improperly, incompletely, or otherwise insufficiently developed. The commission may remand for further proceedings and appropriate action with or without relinquishing the commission's jurisdiction of the appeal. The administrative adjudication procedures of AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) do not apply to the proceedings of the commission.

(e) Within 90 days after written briefing on the appeal is completed or oral argument is held, whichever is later, the commission shall issue a decision in writing. The decision must contain a concise statement of reasons for the decision, including findings of fact, if required, and conclusions of law. The commission shall serve each party and the director with a copy of the decision. Appeals may be expedited for good cause by the commission. Unless reconsideration is ordered under (f) of this section, a decision under this subsection is the final commission decision.

(f) A party or the director may request reconsideration of a decision issued under (e) of this section within 30 days after the date of service shown in the certificate of service of the decision. The request must state specific grounds for reconsideration. Reconsideration may be granted if, in reaching the decision, the commission (1) overlooked, misapplied, or failed to consider a statute, regulation, court or administrative decision, or legal principle directly controlling; (2) overlooked or misconceived a material fact; (3) misconceived a material question in the case; or (4) applied law in the ruling that has subsequently changed. The panel of the commission hearing the request for reconsideration shall consist of the same members of the panel that issued the decision. The commission may issue an order for reconsideration of all or part of the decision upon request of a party or the director. Reconsideration is based on the record, unless the commission allows additional argument. The power to order reconsideration expires 60 days after the date of service, as shown on the certificate of service, of a decision issued under (e) of this section. If the commission does not issue an order for reconsideration within the time allowed for ordering reconsideration, a request for reconsideration is considered denied. If reconsideration is ordered, the commission shall issue a decision within 30 days after the close of the record on reconsideration. The commission shall serve each party in the case with a copy of the decision upon reconsideration. The decision upon reconsideration is the final commission decision.

(g) A decision of the commission becomes final on the

(1) 31st day after the date of service of a decision if reconsideration is not requested;

(2) 61st day after the date of service of a decision if reconsideration is requested but an order for reconsideration is not issued; or

(3) date of service of the commission decision upon reconsideration under (f) of this section if reconsideration is requested and an order for reconsideration is issued.

###### Sec. 23.30.129.   Judicial review of commission orders.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of AS 44.62.560, orders of the commission may not be appealed to the superior court. Consistent with AS 22.05.010(b), final decisions of the commission may be appealed to the supreme court, and other orders may be reviewed by the supreme court as provided by the Alaska Rules of Appellate Procedure.

(b) A finding by the commission concerning the weight to be accorded a witness's testimony, including medical testimony and reports, is conclusive even if the evidence is conflicting or susceptible to contrary conclusions. The commission's findings of fact may be reversed on appeal if not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.

###### Sec. 23.30.130.   Modification of awards.

(a) Upon its own initiative, or upon the application of any party in interest on the ground of a change in conditions, including, for the purposes of AS 23.30.175, a change in residence, or because of a mistake in its determination of a fact, the board may, before one year after the date of the last payment of compensation benefits under AS 23.30.180, 23.30.185, 23.30.190, 23.30.200, or 23.30.215, whether or not a compensation order has been issued, or before one year after the rejection of a claim, review a compensation case under the procedure prescribed in respect of claims in AS 23.30.110. Under AS 23.30.110 the board may issue a new compensation order which terminates, continues, reinstates, increases, or decreases the compensation, or award compensation.

(b) A new order does not affect compensation previously paid, except that an award increasing the compensation rate may be made effective from the date of the injury, and if part of the compensation due or to become due is unpaid, an award decreasing the compensation rate may be made effective from the date of the injury, and payment made earlier in excess of the decreased rate shall be deducted from the unpaid compensation, in the manner the board determines.

###### Sec. 23.30.135.   Procedure before the board.

(a) In making an investigation or inquiry or conducting a hearing the board is not bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence or by technical or formal rules of procedure, except as provided by this chapter.  The board may make its investigation or inquiry or conduct its hearing in the manner by which it may best ascertain the rights of the parties. Declarations of a deceased employee concerning the injury in respect to which the investigation or inquiry is being made or the hearing conducted shall be received in evidence and are, if corroborated by other evidence, sufficient to establish the injury.

(b) All testimony given during a hearing before the board shall be recorded, but need not be transcribed unless further review is initiated. Hearings before the board shall be open to the public.

###### Sec. 23.30.140.   Appointment of guardian by court.

The director may require the appointment of a guardian or other representative by a competent court for any person who is mentally incompetent or a minor to receive compensation payable to the person under this chapter and to exercise the powers granted to or to perform the duties required of the person under this chapter. If the director does not require the appointment of a guardian to receive the compensation of a minor, appointment for this purpose is not necessary.

###### Sec. 23.30.145.   Attorney fees.

(a) Fees for legal services rendered in respect to a claim are not valid unless approved by the board, and the fees may not be less than 25 percent on the first $1,000 of compensation or part of the first $1,000 of compensation, and 10 percent of all sums in excess of $1,000 of compensation.  When the board advises that a claim has been controverted, in whole or in part, the board may direct that the fees for legal services be paid by the employer or carrier in addition to compensation awarded; the fees may be allowed only on the amount of compensation controverted and awarded.  When the board advises that a claim has not been controverted, but further advises that bona fide legal services have been rendered in respect to the claim, then the board shall direct the payment of the fees out of the compensation awarded. In determining the amount of fees the board shall take into consideration the nature, length, and complexity of the services performed, transportation charges, and the benefits resulting from the services to the compensation beneficiaries.

(b) If an employer fails to file timely notice of controversy or fails to pay compensation or medical and related benefits within 15 days after it becomes due or otherwise resists the payment of compensation or medical and related benefits and if the claimant has employed an attorney in the successful prosecution of the claim, the board shall make an award to reimburse the claimant for the costs in the proceedings, including reasonable attorney fees. The award is in addition to the compensation or medical and related benefits ordered.

(c) If proceedings are had for review of a compensation or medical and related benefits order before a court, the court may allow or increase an attorney's fees.  The fees are in addition to compensation or medical and related benefits ordered and shall be paid as the court may direct.

#### Article 4. Payment of Compensation.

###### Sec. 23.30.150.   Commencement of compensation.

Compensation may not be allowed for the first three days of the disability, except the benefits provided for in AS 23.30.095; if, however, the injury results in disability of more than 28 days, compensation shall be allowed from the date of the disability.

###### Sec. 23.30.155.   Payment of compensation.

(a) Compensation under this chapter shall be paid periodically, promptly, and directly to the person entitled to it, without an award, except where liability to pay compensation is controverted by the employer. To controvert a claim, the employer must file a notice, in a format prescribed by the director, stating

(1) that the right of the employee to compensation is controverted;

(2) the name of the employee;

(3) the name of the employer;

(4) the date of the alleged injury or death; and

(5) the type of compensation and all grounds on which the right to compensation is controverted.

(b) The first installment of compensation becomes due on the 14th day after the employer has knowledge of the injury or death. On this date all compensation then due shall be paid. Subsequent compensation shall be paid in installments, every 14 days, except where the board determines that payment in installments should be made monthly or at some other period.

(c) The insurer or adjuster shall notify the division in a format prescribed by the director that the payment of compensation has begun or has been increased, decreased, suspended, terminated, resumed, or changed in type. An initial report shall be filed not later than 28 days after the date of issuing the first payment of compensation. If, at any time, 21 days or more pass and no compensation payment is issued, a report notifying the division of the termination or suspension of compensation shall be filed not later than 28 days after the date the last compensation payment was issued. A report shall also be filed not later than 28 days after the date of issuing a payment increasing, decreasing, resuming, or changing the type of compensation paid. When the insurer or adjuster files a report, the division shall notify the employee of the payment or change in payment of compensation. If the division is not notified within the 28 days prescribed by this subsection for reporting, the insurer or adjuster shall pay a civil penalty of $100 for the first day plus $10 for each day after the first day that the notice was not given. Total penalties under this subsection may not exceed $1,000 for a failure to file a required report. Penalties assessed under this subsection are eligible for reduction under (m) of this section. A penalty assessed under this subsection after penalties have been reduced under (m) of this section shall be increased by 25 percent and shall bear interest at the rate established under AS 45.45.010.

(d) If the employer controverts the right to compensation, the employer shall file with the division, in a format prescribed by the director, a notice of controversion on or before the 21st day after the employer has knowledge of the alleged injury or death. If the employer controverts the right to compensation after payments have begun, the employer shall file with the division, in a format prescribed by the director, a notice of controversion not later than the date an installment of compensation payable without an award is due. When payment of temporary disability benefits is controverted solely on the grounds that another employer or another insurer of the same employer may be responsible for all or a portion of the benefits, the most recent employer or insurer who is party to the claim and who may be liable shall make the payments during the pendency of the dispute. When a final determination of liability is made, any reimbursement required, including interest at the statutory rate, and all costs and attorney fees incurred by the prevailing employer, shall be made not later than 14 days after the determination.

(e) If any installment of compensation payable without an award is not paid within seven days after it becomes due, as provided in (b) of this section, there shall be added to the unpaid installment an amount equal to 25 percent of the installment. This additional amount shall be paid at the same time as, and in addition to, the installment, unless notice is filed under (d) of this section or unless the nonpayment is excused by the board after a showing by the employer that owing to conditions over which the employer had no control the installment could not be paid within the period prescribed for the payment. The additional amount shall be paid directly to the recipient to whom the unpaid installment was to be paid.

(f) If compensation payable under the terms of an award is not paid within 14 days after it becomes due, there shall be added to that unpaid compensation an amount equal to 25 percent of the unpaid installment. The additional amount shall be paid at the same time as, but in addition to, the compensation, unless review of the compensation order making the award as provided under AS 23.30.008 and an interlocutory injunction staying payments is allowed by the court. The additional amount shall be paid directly to the recipient to whom the unpaid compensation was to be paid.

(g)  [Repealed,§3 ch 59 SLA 1981.]

(h) The board may upon its own initiative at any time in a case in which payments are being made with or without an award, where right to compensation is controverted, or where payments of compensation have been increased, reduced, terminated, changed, or suspended, upon receipt of notice from a person entitled to compensation, or from the employer, that the right to compensation is controverted, or that payments of compensation have been increased, reduced, terminated, changed, or suspended, make the investigations, cause the medical examinations to be made, or hold the hearings, and take the further action which it considers will properly protect the rights of all parties.

(i) When the director considers it advisable, the director may require an employer to make a deposit with the Department of Revenue to secure the prompt and convenient payment of the compensation, and payments from the deposit upon an award shall be made upon order of the director.

(j) If an employer has made advance payments or overpayments of compensation, the employer is entitled to be reimbursed by withholding up to 20 percent out of each unpaid installment or installments of compensation due.  More than 20 percent of unpaid installments of compensation due may be withheld from an employee only on approval of the board.

(k) An injured employee or, in case of death, the employee's dependents or personal representative shall give receipts for payment of compensation to the employer paying the compensation, and the employer shall produce the receipts for inspection by the director, whenever required.

(l)  [Repealed,§1 ch 83 SLA 1975.]

(m) On or before March 1 of each year, the insurer or adjuster shall file a verified annual report in a format prescribed by the director stating the total amount of all compensation by type, the number of claims received and the percentage controverted, medical and related benefits, vocational rehabilitation expenses, legal fees, including a separate total of fees paid to attorneys and fees paid for the other costs of litigation, and penalties paid on all claims during the preceding calendar year. If the annual report is timely and complete when received by the division and provides accurate information about each category of payments, the director shall review the timeliness of the insurer's or adjuster's reports filed during the preceding year under (c) of this section. If, during the preceding year, the insurer or adjuster filed at least 99 percent of the reports on time, the penalties assessed under (c) of this section shall be waived. If, during the preceding year, the insurer or adjuster filed at least 97 percent of the reports on time, 75 percent of the penalties assessed under (c) of this section shall be waived. If, during the preceding year, the insurer or adjuster filed 95 percent of the reports on time, 50 percent of the penalties assessed under (c) of this section shall be waived. If, during the preceding year, the insurer's or adjuster's reports have not been filed on time at least 95 percent of the time, none of the penalties assessed under (c) of this section shall be waived. The penalties that are not waived are due and payable when the insurer or adjuster receives notification from the director regarding the timeliness of the reports. If the annual report is not filed by March 1 of each year, the insurer or adjuster shall pay a civil penalty of $100 for the first day the annual report is late and $10 for each additional day the report is late. If the annual report is incomplete when filed, the insurer or adjuster shall pay a civil penalty of $1,000.

(n) If the employer is self-insured or uninsured, the requirements of (c) and (m) of this section apply to the employer.

(o) The director shall promptly notify the division of insurance if the board determines that the employer's insurer has frivolously or unfairly controverted compensation due under this chapter. After receiving notice from the director, the division of insurance shall determine if the insurer has committed an unfair claim settlement practice under AS 21.36.125.

(p) An employer shall pay interest on compensation that is not paid when due. Interest required under this subsection accrues at the rate specified in AS 09.30.070(a) that is in effect on the date the compensation is due.

(q)  [Repealed,§22 ch 91 SLA 2018.]

###### Sec. 23.30.160.   Assignment and exemption of claims.

(a) An assignment, release, or commutation of compensation or benefits due or payable under this chapter, except as provided by this chapter, is not valid.

(b) Benefits payable under this chapter are exempt from levy to enforce the collection of a debt as provided in AS 09.38 (exemptions).  This exemption may not be waived.

###### Sec. 23.30.165.   Lien.

(a) Each employee and beneficiary entitled to compensation under the provisions of this chapter has a lien for the full amount of the compensation the person is entitled to, including costs and disbursements of suit and attorney fees allowed, upon all of the property in connection with the construction, preservation, maintenance, or operation of which the work of the employee was being performed at the time of the injury or death.  For example: in the case of an employee injured or killed while engaged in mining or in work connected with mining, the lien extends to the entire mine and all property used in connection with it; and in the case of an employee injured or killed while engaged in fishing or in the packing, canning, or salting of fish, or other branch of the fish industry, the lien extends to the entire packing, fishing, salting, or canning plant or establishment and all property used in connection with it; and this is the case with other businesses, industries, works, occupations, and employments.

(b) The lien is prior and paramount to any other lien on the property, except a lien for wages or materials as provided by law, and is of equal rank with a lien for wages or materials.

(c) The lien extends to all right, title, interest, and claim of the employer in the property affected by the lien.

(d) A person claiming a lien under this chapter shall, within one year after the date of the injury from which the claim of compensation arises, record in the office of the recorder of the recording district in which the property affected by the lien is located a notice of lien signed and verified by the claimant or someone on behalf of the claimant, and stating, in substance, the name of the person injured or killed out of which injury or death the claim of compensation arises, the name of the employer of the injured or deceased person at the time of the injury or death, a description of the property affected or covered by the lien, and the name of the owner or reputed owner of the property.

(e) The lien for compensation provided for in this section may be enforced by equitable proceedings as in the enforcement of other liens upon real or personal property, within 10 months after the cause of action arises.  Nothing in this section prevents an attachment of property as security for the payment of compensation.

###### Sec. 23.30.170.   Collection of defaulted payments.

(a) In case of default by the employer in the payment of compensation due under an award of compensation for a period of 30 days after the compensation is due, the person to whom the compensation is payable may, within one year after the default, apply to the board making the compensation order for a supplementary order declaring the amount of the default. After investigation, notice, and hearing, as provided in AS 23.30.110, the board shall make a supplementary order declaring the amount of the default. The order shall be filed in the same manner as the compensation order.

(b) If the payment in default is an installment of the award, the board may, in its discretion, declare the whole of the award as the amount in default.  The applicant may file a certified copy of the supplementary order with the clerk of the superior court.  The supplementary order is final.  The court shall, upon the filing of the copy, enter judgment for the amount declared in default by the supplementary order if it is in accordance with law.  Any time after a supplementary order by the board, the attorney general, when requested to do so by the commissioner, shall take appropriate action to assure collection of the defaulted payments.

(c) Review of the judgment may be had as in a civil action for damages.  Final proceedings to execute the judgment may be had by writ of execution.  The court shall modify the judgment to conform to a later compensation order upon presentation of a certified copy of it to the court.

#### Article 5. Computation of Compensation.

###### Sec. 23.30.172.   Benefit adjustments. [Repealed,§11 ch 75 SLA 1977.]

###### Sec. 23.30.175.   Rates of compensation.

(a) The weekly rate of compensation for disability or death may not exceed the maximum compensation rate, may not be less than 22 percent of the maximum compensation rate, and initially may not be less than $110. However, if the board determines that the employee's spendable weekly wages are less than $110 a week as computed under AS 23.30.220, or less than 22 percent of the maximum compensation rate a week in the case of an employee who has furnished documentary proof of the employee's wages, it shall issue an order adjusting the weekly rate of compensation to a rate equal to the employee's spendable weekly wages. If the employer can verify that the employee's spendable weekly wages are less than 22 percent of the maximum compensation rate, the employer may adjust the weekly rate of compensation to a rate equal to the employee's spendable weekly wages without an order of the board. If the employee's spendable weekly wages are greater than 22 percent of the maximum compensation rate, but 80 percent of the employee's spendable weekly wages is less than 22 percent of the maximum compensation rate, the employee's weekly rate of compensation shall be 22 percent of the maximum compensation rate. Prior payments made in excess of the adjusted rate shall be deducted from the unpaid compensation in the manner the board determines. In any case, the employer shall pay timely compensation. In this subsection, "maximum compensation rate" means 120 percent of the average weekly wage, calculated under (d) of this section, applicable on the date of injury of the employee.

(b) The following rules apply to benefits payable to recipients not residing in the state at the time compensation benefits are payable:

(1) the weekly rate of compensation shall be calculated by multiplying the recipient's weekly compensation rate calculated under AS 23.30.180, 23.30.185, 23.30.190, 23.30.200, or 23.30.215 by the ratio of the cost of living of the area in which the recipient resides to the cost of living in this state;

(2) the calculation required by (1) of this subsection does not apply if the recipient is absent from the state for medical or rehabilitation services not reasonably available in the state;

(3) if the gross weekly earnings of the recipient and the resulting compensation rate are determined under AS 23.30.220(a)(6), (7), or (10), the calculation required by this subsection applies only to the portion of the recipient's weekly compensation rate attributable to wages earned in the state;

(4) application of this subsection may not reduce the weekly compensation rate to less than $154 a week, except as provided in (a) of this section;

(5) application of (1)§(4) of this subsection may not result in raising a recipient's weekly compensation rate to an amount that exceeds the weekly compensation rate that the recipient would have received if the recipient had been residing in the state.

(c) The department shall provide by regulation for the determination and comparison of living costs for this state and the other areas in which recipients reside and for the redetermination and comparison of these costs every three years.

(d) By December 1 of each year, the commissioner shall determine the average weekly wage in this state by dividing the average annual wage in this state for the preceding calendar year by 52. The resulting figure is the average weekly wage in this state applicable for the period beginning January 1 and ending December 31 of the following calendar year. The average annual wage calculation required under this subsection shall include the wages of all employees in the state, both public and private, who are covered by this chapter.

(e) If the commissioner fails to determine the average weekly wage in the state as required in (d) of this section until after January 1, but before April 1, of the year following the date the determination was to be made, an employer is not required to make a retroactive adjustment of compensation.

###### Sec. 23.30.180.   Permanent total disability.

(a) In case of total disability adjudged to be permanent 80 percent of the injured employee's spendable weekly wages shall be paid to the employee during the continuance of the total disability.  If a permanent partial disability award has been made before a permanent total disability determination, permanent total disability benefits must be reduced by the amount of the permanent partial disability award, adjusted for inflation, in a manner determined by the board. Loss of both hands, or both arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any two of them, in the absence of conclusive proof to the contrary, constitutes permanent total disability.  In all other cases permanent total disability is determined in accordance with the facts. In making this determination the market for the employee's services shall be

(1) area of residence;

(2) area of last employment;

(3) the state of residence; and

(4) the State of Alaska.

(b) Failure to achieve remunerative employability as defined in AS 23.30.041(r) does not, by itself, constitute permanent total disability.

###### Sec. 23.30.185.   Compensation for temporary total disability.

In case of disability total in character but temporary in quality, 80 percent of the injured employee's spendable weekly wages shall be paid to the employee during the continuance of the disability. Temporary total disability benefits may not be paid for any period of disability occurring after the date of medical stability.

###### Sec. 23.30.187.   Effect of unemployment benefits.

Compensation is not payable to an employee under AS 23.30.180 or 23.30.185 for a week in which the employee receives unemployment benefits.

###### Sec. 23.30.190.   Compensation for permanent partial impairment; rating guides.

(a) In case of impairment partial in character but permanent in quality, and not resulting in permanent total disability, the compensation is $273,000 multiplied by the employee's percentage of permanent impairment of the whole person. The percentage of permanent impairment of the whole person is the percentage of impairment to the particular body part, system, or function converted to the percentage of impairment to the whole person as provided under (b) of this section. The compensation is payable in a single lump sum, except as otherwise provided in AS 23.30.041, but the compensation may not be discounted for any present value considerations.

(b) All determinations of the existence and degree of permanent impairment shall be made strictly and solely under the whole person determination as set out in the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, except that an impairment rating may not be rounded to the next five percent. The board shall adopt a supplementary recognized schedule for injuries that cannot be rated by use of the American Medical Association Guides.

(c) The impairment rating determined under (a) of this section shall be reduced by a permanent impairment that existed before the compensable injury. If the combination of a prior impairment rating and a rating under (a) of this section would result in the employee being considered permanently totally disabled, the prior rating does not negate a finding of permanent total disability.

(d) When a new edition of the American Medical Association Guides described in (b) of this section is published, the board shall, not later than 90 days after the last day of the month in which the new edition is published, hold an open meeting under AS 44.62.310 to select the date on which the new edition will be used to make all determinations required under (b) of this section. The date selected by the board for using the new edition may not be later than 90 days after the last day of the month in which the new edition is published. After the meeting, the board shall issue a public notice announcing the date selected. The requirements of AS 44.62.010§44.62.300 do not apply to the selection or announcement of the date under this subsection.

###### Sec. 23.30.191.   Expenses for rehabilitating injured employees. [Repealed,§27 ch 93 SLA 1982.  For current law concerning rehabilitation of injured workers, see AS 23.30.041.]

###### Sec. 23.30.195.   Survival of the right to compensation.

(a) Compensation to which any claimant would be entitled under AS 23.30.190 shall, notwithstanding death arising from causes other than the injury, be payable to and for the benefit of the persons following:

(1) if there be a widow or widower and no child of the deceased, to the widow or widower;

(2) if there be a widow or widower and a surviving child of the deceased, one-half to the widow or widower, the other half to the surviving child;

(3) if there be a surviving child of the deceased, but no widow or widower, then to the child.

(b) An award for disability may be made after the death of the injured employee.

###### Sec. 23.30.200.   Temporary partial disability.

(a) In case of temporary partial disability resulting in decrease of earning capacity the compensation shall be 80 percent of the difference between the injured employee's spendable weekly wages before the injury and the wage-earning capacity of the employee after the injury in the same or another employment, to be paid during the continuance of the disability, but not to be paid for more than five years. Temporary partial disability benefits may not be paid for a period of disability occurring after the date of medical stability.

(b) The wage-earning capacity of an injured employee is determined by the actual spendable weekly wage of the employee if the actual spendable weekly wage fairly and reasonably represents the wage-earning capacity of the employee. The board may, in the interest of justice, fix the wage-earning capacity that is reasonable, having due regard to the nature of the injury, the degree of physical impairment, the usual employment, and other factors or circumstances in the case that may affect the capacity of the employee to earn wages in a disabled condition, including the effect of disability as it may naturally extend into the future.

###### Sec. 23.30.205.   Injury combined with preexisting impairment.

(a) If an employee who has a permanent physical impairment from any cause or origin incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course of the employment resulting in compensation liability for disability that is substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and subsequent injury or by reason of the aggravation of the preexisting impairment than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer or the insurance carrier shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation provided by this chapter, but the employer or the insurance carrier shall be reimbursed from the second injury fund for all compensation payments subsequent to those payable for the first 104 weeks of disability.

(b) If the subsequent injury of the employee results in the death of the employee and it is determined that the death would not have occurred except for the preexisting permanent physical impairment, the employer or the insurance carrier shall in the first instance pay the compensation prescribed by this chapter, but the employer or the insurance carrier shall be reimbursed from the second injury fund for all compensation payable in excess of 104 weeks.

(c) In order to qualify under this section for reimbursement from the second injury fund, the employer must establish by written records that the employer had knowledge of the permanent physical impairment before the subsequent injury and that the employee was retained in employment after the employer acquired that knowledge.

(d) The second injury fund may not be bound as to any question of law or fact by reason of an award or an adjudication to which it was not a party or in relation to which the director was not notified at least three weeks before the award or adjudication that the fund might be subject to liability for the injury or death.

(e) An employer or the employer's carrier shall notify the commissioner of labor and workforce development of any possible claim against the second injury fund as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 100 weeks after the employer or the employer's carrier has knowledge of the injury or death or after the deadline for submitting a claim for reimbursement under (f) of this section.

(f) An employer or the employer's insurance carrier shall satisfy all requirements for reimbursement under this section, including notice of any possible claim and payment of compensation in excess of 104 weeks, before submitting a claim for reimbursement to the second injury fund. Notwithstanding (a) and (b) of this section, a claim for reimbursement may not be submitted for an injury or death that occurs after August 31, 2018, and must be submitted before October 1, 2020. An employer that qualifies for reimbursement under this section shall continue to receive reimbursement payments on claims accepted by the fund, or ordered by the board, until the fund's liabilities for the claim are extinguished.

(g) In this section, "permanent physical impairment" means any permanent condition, whether congenital or due to injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if the employee should become unemployed.  A condition may not be considered a "permanent physical impairment" unless

(1) it is one of the following conditions:

(A) epilepsy,

(B) diabetes,

(C) cardiac disease,

(D) arthritis,

(E) amputated foot, leg, arm, or hand,

(F) loss of sight of one or both eyes or a partial loss of uncorrected vision of more than 75 percent bilaterally,

(G) residual disability from poliomyelitis,

(H) cerebral palsy,

(I) multiple sclerosis,

(J) Parkinson's disease,

(K) cerebral vascular accident,

(L) tuberculosis,

(P) osteoporosis,

(Q) ankylosis of joints,

(R) hyperinsulinism,

(S) muscular dystrophies,

(T) arteriosclerosis,

(V) varicose veins,

(W) heavy metal poisoning,

(X) ionizing radiation injury,

(AA) spondylolisthesis; or

(2) it would support a rating of disability of 200 weeks or more if evaluated according to standards applied in compensation claims.

###### Sec. 23.30.210.   Determination of wage-earning capacity. [Repealed,§44 ch 79 SLA 1988.]

###### Sec. 23.30.215.   Compensation for death.

(a) If the injury causes death, the compensation is known as a death benefit and is payable in the following amounts to or for the benefit of the following persons:

(1) reasonable and necessary funeral expenses not exceeding $12,000;

(2) if there is a widow or widower or a child or children of the deceased, the following percentages of the spendable weekly wages of the deceased:

(A) 80 percent for the widow or widower with no children;

(B) 50 percent for the widow or widower with one child and 40 percent for the child;

(C) 30 percent for the widow or widower with two or more children and 70 percent divided equally among the children;

(D) 100 percent for an only child when there is no widow or widower;

(E) 100 percent, divided equally, if there are two or more children and no widow or widower;

(3) if the widow or widower remarries, the widow or widower is entitled to be paid in one sum an amount equal to the compensation to which the widow or widower would otherwise be entitled in the two years commencing on the date of remarriage as full and final settlement of all sums due the widow or widower;

(4) if there is no widow or widower or child or children, then for the support of father, mother, grandchildren, brothers, and sisters, if dependent on the deceased at the time of injury, 42 percent of the spendable weekly wage of the deceased to such beneficiaries, share and share alike, not to exceed $150,000 in the aggregate;

(5) $8,000 to a surviving widow or widower, or equally divided among surviving children of the deceased if there is no widow or widower.

(b) In computing death benefits, the spendable weekly wage of the deceased shall be computed under AS 23.30.220 and shall be paid in accordance with AS 23.30.155 and subject to the weekly maximum limitation in the aggregate as provided in AS 23.30.175, but the total weekly compensation may not be less than $75 for a widow or widower nor less than $25 weekly to a child or $50 for children.

(c) All questions of dependency shall be determined as of the time of the injury, or death.

(d) Compensation under this chapter to aliens not residents, or about to become nonresidents, of the United States or Canada is the same in amount as provided for residents, except that dependents in a foreign country are limited to widow or widower and child or children, or if there is no widow or widower and child or children, to surviving father or mother whom the employee has supported, either wholly or in part, for a period of one year before the date of injury.  The board, at its option, or upon the application of the insurance carrier, may commute all future installments of compensation to be paid to an alien dependent who is not a resident of the United States or Canada by paying or causing to be paid to the alien dependent one-half of the commuted amount of the future installments of compensation as determined by the board.

(e) Death benefits payable to a widow or widower in accordance with (a) of this section shall abate as that person ceases to be entitled and does not inure to persons subject to continued entitlement.  In the event a child ceases to be entitled, that child's share shall inure to the benefit of the surviving spouse subject to adjustment as provided in (f) of this section.

(f) Except as provided in (g) of this section, the death benefit payable to a widow or widower shall terminate 12 years following death of the deceased employee.

(g) The provisions of (f) of this section do not apply to a widow or widower who at the time of death of the deceased worker is permanently and totally disabled.  The death benefits payable to a widow or widower are not subject to reduction under (f) of this section after the widow or widower has attained the age of 52 years.

(h) In the event a deceased worker is survived by children of a former marriage not living with the surviving widow or widower, then those children shall receive the amount being paid under a decree of child support; the difference between this amount and the maximum benefit payable under this section shall be distributed pro rata to the remainder of those entitled.

(i) In the event the total amount of all benefits computed under (a)(2) of this section exceeds the maximum benefit provided in AS 23.30.175, the maximum benefit under AS 23.30.175 shall be prorated among entitled survivors.

###### Sec. 23.30.220.   Determination of spendable weekly wage.

(a) Computation of compensation under this chapter shall be on the basis of an employee's spendable weekly wage at the time of injury. An employee's spendable weekly wage is the employee's gross weekly earnings minus payroll tax deductions. An employee's gross weekly earnings shall be calculated as follows:

(1) if at the time of injury the employee's earnings are calculated by the week, the weekly amount is the employee's gross weekly earnings;

(2) if at the time of injury the employee's earnings are calculated by the month, the employee's gross weekly earnings are the monthly earnings multiplied by 12 and divided by 52;

(3) if at the time of injury the employee's earnings are calculated by the year, the employee's gross weekly earnings are the yearly earnings divided by 52;

(4) if at the time of injury the employee's earnings are calculated by the day, by the hour, or by the output of the employee, then the employee's gross weekly earnings are 1/50 of the total wages that the employee earned from all occupations during either of the two calendar years immediately preceding the injury, whichever is most favorable to the employee;

(5) if at the time of injury the employee's earnings have not been fixed or cannot be ascertained, the employee's earnings for the purpose of calculating compensation are the usual wage for similar services when the services are rendered by paid employees;

(6) if at the time of injury the employee's earnings are calculated by the week under (1) of this subsection or by the month under (2) of this subsection and the employment is exclusively seasonal or temporary, then the gross weekly earnings are 1/50 of the total wages that the employee has earned from all occupations during the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the injury;

(7) when the employee is working under concurrent contracts with two or more employers, the employee's earnings from all employers is considered as if earned from the employer liable for compensation;

(8) if an employee when injured is a minor, an apprentice, or a trainee in a formalized training program, as determined by the board, whose wages under normal conditions would increase during the period of disability, the projected increase may be considered by the board in computing the gross weekly earnings of the employee; if the minor, apprentice, or trainee would have likely continued that training program, then the compensation shall be the average weekly wage at the time of injury rather than that based on the individual's prior earnings;

(9) if the employee is injured while performing duties as a volunteer ambulance attendant, volunteer police officer, or volunteer firefighter, then, notwithstanding (1)§(6) of this subsection, the gross weekly earnings for calculating compensation shall be the minimum gross weekly earnings paid a full-time ambulance attendant, police officer, or firefighter employed in the political subdivision where the injury occurred, or, if the political subdivision has no full-time ambulance attendants, police officers, or firefighters, at a reasonable figure previously set by the political subdivision to make this determination, but in no case may the gross weekly earnings for calculating compensation be less than the minimum wage computed on the basis of 40 hours work per week;

(10) if an employee is entitled to compensation under AS 23.30.180 and the board determines that calculation of the employee's gross weekly earnings under (1)§(7) of this subsection does not fairly reflect the employee's earnings during the period of disability, the board shall determine gross weekly earnings by considering the nature of the employee's work, work history, and resulting disability, but compensation calculated under this paragraph may not exceed the employee's gross weekly earnings at the time of injury.

(b) The commissioner shall annually prepare formulas that shall be used to calculate an employee's spendable weekly wage on the basis of gross weekly earnings, number of dependents, marital status, and payroll tax deductions.

(c) In this section,

(1) "seasonal work" means employment that is not intended to continue through an entire calendar year, but recurs on an annual basis;

(2) "temporary work" means employment that is not permanent, ends upon completion of the task, job, or contract, and ends within six months from the date of injury.

(1) the difference between 100 percent of the employee's spendable weekly wage and an amount equal to the disability benefit, disability pension, or medical retirement benefit that the employee is eligible to receive as a result of the injury or illness, as calculated on a weekly basis, under the retirement system or welfare or pension plan or trust; or

(2) the maximum compensation rate calculated under AS 23.30.175.

(1) the difference between 100 percent of the employee's spendable weekly wage and an amount equal to the disability benefit, disability pension, or medical retirement benefit that the employee is eligible to receive as a result of the injury or illness, calculated on a weekly basis, under the retirement system or welfare or pension plan or trust; or

(2) 105 percent of the average weekly wage calculated under AS 23.30.175(d).

(f) If the union or group retirement system, pension plan, or trust referred to in (e) of this section provides by its terms that its benefits are precluded or reduced if benefits are awarded under this chapter, the limitation provided in (e)(1) of this section is not applicable to the extent of the amount precluded or reduced.

(g) If the employee receives a lump sum distribution of disability benefits, disability pension, or medical retirement benefits, the combined workers' compensation and weekly disability or medical retirement benefit specified in this section shall be calculated by assuming that the employee received weekly disability or medical retirement payments under the applicable plan from the date of eligibility for the disability benefit or medical retirement until the total of the weekly payments equals the amount of the lump sum, exclusive of that portion of the lump sum specifically set aside under the applicable plan for retraining expenses, medical and transportation expenses, and attorney fees or other legal costs.

###### Sec. 23.30.225.   Social security and pension or profit sharing plan offsets.

(a) When periodic retirement or survivors' benefits are payable under 42 U.S.C. 401§433 (Title II, Social Security Act), the weekly compensation provided for in this chapter shall be reduced by an amount equal as nearly as practicable to one-half of the federal periodic benefits for a given week.

(b) When it is determined that, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 401§433, periodic disability benefits are payable to an employee or the employee's dependents for an injury for which a claim has been filed under this chapter, weekly disability benefits payable under this chapter shall be offset by an amount by which the sum of (1) weekly benefits to which the employee is entitled under 42 U.S.C. 401§433, and (2) weekly disability benefits to which the employee would otherwise be entitled under this chapter, exceeds 80 percent of the employee's average weekly wages at the time of injury.

(c) If employer contributions to a qualified pension or profit sharing plan have been included in the determination of gross earnings and the employee is receiving pension or profit sharing payments, weekly compensation benefits payable under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount paid or payable to the injured worker under the plan for any week or weeks during which compensation benefits are also payable. The amount of the reduction may not in any week exceed the increase in weekly compensation benefits brought about by the inclusion of employer contributions to a qualified pension or profit sharing plan in the determination of gross earnings.

#### Article 2. Public Employment Relations Act.

###### Sec. 23.40.070.   Declaration of policy.

The legislature finds that joint decision-making is the modern way of administering government.  If public employees have been granted the right to share in the decision-making process affecting wages and working conditions, they have become more responsive and better able to exchange ideas and information on operations with their administrators.  Accordingly, government is made more effective. The legislature further finds that the enactment of positive legislation establishing guidelines for public employment relations is the best way to harness and direct the energies of public employees eager to have a voice in determining their conditions of work, to provide a rational method for dealing with disputes and work stoppages, to strengthen the merit principle where civil service is in effect, and to maintain a favorable political and social environment.  The legislature declares that it is the public policy of the state to promote harmonious and cooperative relations between government and its employees and to protect the public by assuring effective and orderly operations of government.  These policies are to be effectuated by

(1) recognizing the right of public employees to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining;

(2) requiring public employers to negotiate with and enter into written agreements with employee organizations on matters of wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment;

(3) maintaining merit-system principles among public employees.

Bargaining units shall be as large as is reasonable, and unnecessary fragmenting shall be avoided.

###### Sec. 23.40.100.   Representatives and elections.

(a) The labor relations agency shall investigate a petition if it is submitted in a manner prescribed by the labor relations agency and is

(1) by an employee or group of employees or an organization acting in their behalf alleging that 30 percent of the employees of a proposed bargaining unit

(A) want to be represented for collective bargaining by a labor or employee organization as exclusive representative, or

(b) If the labor relations agency has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, it shall provide for an appropriate hearing upon due notice.  If the labor relations agency finds that there is a question of representation, it shall direct an election by secret ballot to determine whether or by which organization the employees desire to be represented and shall certify the results of the election. Nothing in this section prohibits the waiving of hearings by stipulation for the purpose of a consent election in conformity with the regulations of the labor relations agency or an election in a bargaining unit agreed upon by the parties.  The labor relations agency shall determine who is eligible to vote in an election and shall establish rules governing the election.  In an election in which none of the choices on the ballot receives a majority of the votes cast, a runoff election shall be conducted, the ballot providing for selection between the two choices receiving the largest and the second largest number of valid votes cast in the election.  If an organization receives the majority of the votes cast in the election it shall be certified by the labor relations agency as exclusive representative of all the employees in the bargaining unit.

(2) payment by the employee to the exclusive bargaining agent of a service fee to reimburse the exclusive bargaining agent for the expense of representing the members of the bargaining unit.

If the labor relations agency finds that a person named in the complaint or accusation has not engaged or is not engaging in a prohibited practice, the labor relations agency shall state its findings of fact and issue an order dismissing the complaint or accusation.

###### Sec. 23.40.150.   Enforcement by injunction.

###### Sec. 23.40.180.   Penalty for violation of order or decision.

A person who violates a provision of an order or decision of the labor relations agency is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable by a fine of not more than $500.

###### Sec. 23.40.190.   Mediation.

If, after a reasonable period of negotiation over the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, a deadlock exists between a public employer and an organization, the labor relations agency may appoint a competent, impartial, disinterested person to act as mediator in any dispute either on its own initiative or on the request of one of the parties to the dispute.  The parties may also select a mediator by agreement or mutual consent.  It is the function of the mediator to bring the parties together voluntarily under such favorable auspices as will tend to effectuate settlement of the dispute, but neither the mediator nor the labor relations agency has any power of compulsion in mediation proceedings.

###### Sec. 23.40.200.   Classes of public employees; arbitration.

(a) For purposes of this section, public employees are employed to perform services in one of the three following classes:

(1) those services which may not be given up for even the shortest period of time;

(2) those services which may be interrupted for a limited period but not for an indefinite period of time; and

(3) those services in which work stoppages may be sustained for extended periods without serious effects on the public.

(b) The class in (a)(1) of this section is composed of police and fire protection employees, jail, prison, and other correctional institution employees, and hospital employees. Employees in this class may not engage in strikes. Upon a showing by a public employer or the labor relations agency that employees in this class are engaging or about to engage in a strike, an injunction, restraining order, or other order that may be appropriate shall be granted by the superior court in the judicial district in which the strike is occurring or is about to occur. If an impasse or deadlock is reached in collective bargaining between the public employer and employees in this class, and mediation has been utilized without resolving the deadlock, the parties shall submit to arbitration to be carried out under AS 09.43.030 or 09.43.480 to the extent permitted by AS 09.43.010 and 09.43.300.

(c) The class in (a)(2) of this section is composed of public utility, snow removal, sanitation, and educational institution employees other than employees of a school district, a regional educational attendance area, or a state boarding school. Employees in this class may engage in a strike after mediation, subject to the voting requirement of (d) of this section, for a limited time. The limit is determined by the interests of the health, safety, or welfare of the public. The public employer or the labor relations agency may apply to the superior court in the judicial district in which the strike is occurring for an order enjoining the strike. A strike may not be enjoined unless it can be shown that it has begun to threaten the health, safety, or welfare of the public. A court, in deciding whether or not to enjoin the strike, shall consider the total equities in the particular class. "Total equities" includes not only the effect of a strike on the public but also the extent to which employee organizations and public employers have met their statutory obligations. If an impasse or deadlock still exists after the issuance of an injunction, the parties shall submit to arbitration to be carried out under AS 09.43.030 or 09.43.480 to the extent permitted by AS 09.43.010 and 09.43.300.

(d) The class in (a)(3) of this section includes all other public employees who are not included in the classes in (a)(1) or (2) of this section. Subject to (g) of this section, employees in this class may engage in a strike if a majority of the employees in a collective bargaining unit vote by secret ballot to do so.

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the employees with the concurrence of the employer may agree in writing to submit a dispute arising from interpretation or application of a collective bargaining agreement to arbitration.

(f) The parties to a collective bargaining agreement may provide in the agreement a contract for arbitration to be conducted solely according to AS 09.43.010§09.43.180 (Uniform Arbitration Act) or AS 09.43.300§09.43.595 (Revised Uniform Arbitration Act) to the extent permitted by AS 09.43.010 and 09.43.300 if either Act is incorporated into the agreement or contract by reference.

(g) Under the provisions of (d) of this section, if an impasse or deadlock is reached in collective bargaining negotiations between a municipal school district, a regional educational attendance area, or a state boarding school and its employees,

(1) the parties shall submit to advisory arbitration before the employees may vote to engage in a strike; the arbitrator shall

(A) be a member of the American Arbitration Association, Panel of Labor Arbitrators, or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service;

(B) have knowledge of and recent experience in the local conditions in the school district, regional educational attendance area, or state boarding school; and

(C) be determined from a list containing at least five nominees who meet the qualifications of this subsection; this list shall be considered a complete list for the purpose of striking names and selecting the arbitrator;

(2) if, under (1) of this subsection, advisory arbitration fails, a strike may not begin until at least 72 hours after notice of the strike is given to the other party; in any event, a strike may not begin on or after the first day of the school term, as that term is described in AS 14.03.030, unless at least one day in session with students in attendance has passed after notice of the strike is given by the employees to the other party.

###### Sec. 23.40.205.   Family leave.

Notwithstanding any provision of AS 23.40.070§23.40.260 to the contrary, an agreement between the employer subject to AS 39.20.500§39.20.550 and an employee bargaining organization that does not contain benefit provisions at least as beneficial to the employee as those provided by AS 39.20.500§39.20.550 shall be considered to contain the benefit provisions of those statutes.

###### Sec. 23.40.210.   Agreement; cost-of-living differential.

(a) Upon the completion of negotiations between an organization and a public employer, if a settlement is reached, the employer shall reduce it to writing in the form of an agreement.  The agreement may include a term for which it will remain in effect, not to exceed three years.  The agreement shall include a pay plan designed to provide for a cost-of-living differential between the salaries paid employees residing in the state and employees residing outside the state. The plan shall provide that the salaries paid, as of August 26, 1977, to employees residing outside the state shall remain unchanged until the difference between those salaries and the salaries paid employees residing in the state reflects the difference between the cost of living in Alaska and living in Seattle, Washington.  The agreement shall include a grievance procedure which shall have binding arbitration as its final step. Either party to the agreement has a right of action to enforce the agreement by petition to the labor relations agency.

(b) An employee is eligible for the cost-of-living differential under (a) of this section only if the individual is a state resident. The required presence of an employee at a work station where room and board are provided or reimbursed by the employer may not be considered to be physical presence in the state or physical absence from the state for purposes of determining eligibility for the cost-of-living differential.

(c) The commissioner of administration may adopt regulations under AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) to clarify and implement the criteria for establishing and maintaining eligibility for the cost-of-living differential.

(d) An agreement entered into under AS 23.40.070§23.40.260 must require compliance with the eligibility criteria for receiving the cost-of-living differential contained in this section and the regulations adopted by the commissioner under (c) of this section.

(e) In this section, "state resident" means an individual who is physically present in the state with the intent to remain permanently in the state under the requirements of AS 01.10.055 or, if the individual is not physically present in the state, intends to return to the state and remain permanently in the state under the requirements of AS 01.10.055 and is absent only temporarily for reasons allowed under AS 43.23.008 or a successor statute.

###### Sec. 23.40.212.   Agreement with the Board of Regents.

(a) The Board of Regents of the University of Alaska may delegate to the Department of Administration its authority under AS 23.40.070§23.40.260 to negotiate with an organization for an agreement.

(b) The Department of Administration shall participate in the negotiations between the Board of Regents and an organization.  An agreement between the board and an organization requires the approval of the department.

###### Sec. 23.40.215.   Monetary terms subject to legislative funding.

(a) The monetary terms of any agreement entered into under AS 23.40.070§23.40.260 are subject to funding through legislative appropriation.

(b) The Department of Administration shall submit the monetary terms of an agreement to the legislature within 10 legislative days after the agreement of the parties, if the legislature is in session, or within 10 legislative days after the convening of the next regular session. The complete monetary and nonmonetary terms of a tentative agreement shall be submitted to the legislature no later than the 60th day of the legislative session to receive legislative consideration during that calendar year. However, if the department has submitted a tentative agreement in a timely manner and the parties to the agreement decide to renegotiate the terms, the renegotiated agreement shall be considered to have been submitted in a timely manner. In this subsection, "tentative agreement" means an agreement that has been reached by the negotiators for the employer and the bargaining unit but that may not yet have been ratified by the members of the bargaining unit.

(c) Notwithstanding (b) of this section, the monetary terms of an agreement entered into between a school district or regional educational attendance area and its employees are not required to be submitted to the legislature.

###### Sec. 23.40.220.   Labor or employee organization dues and employee benefits, deduction and authorization.

Upon written authorization of a public employee within a bargaining unit, the public employer shall deduct from the payroll of the public employee the monthly amount of dues, fees, and other employee benefits as certified by the secretary of the exclusive bargaining representative and shall deliver it to the chief fiscal officer of the exclusive bargaining representative.

###### Sec. 23.40.225.   Exemption based on religious convictions.

Notwithstanding the provisions of AS 23.40.220, a collective bargaining settlement reached, or agreement entered into, under AS 23.40.210 that incorporates union security provisions, including a union shop or agency shop provision or agreement, shall safeguard the rights of nonassociation of employees having bona fide religious convictions based on tenets or teachings of a church or religious body of which an employee is a member. Upon submission of proper proof of religious conviction to the labor relations agency, the agency shall declare the employee exempt from becoming a member of a labor organization or employee association. The employee shall pay an amount of money equivalent to regular union or association dues, initiation fees, and assessments to the union or association. Nonpayment of this money subjects the employee to the same penalty as if it were nonpayment of dues. The receiving union or association shall contribute an equivalent amount of money to a charity of its choice not affiliated with a religious, labor, or employee organization. The union or association shall submit proof of contribution to the labor relations agency.

###### Sec. 23.40.230.   Assistance by Department of Labor. [Repealed, E.O. No. 77§8 SLA 1990.]

###### Sec. 23.40.235.   Public involvement in school district negotiations.

Before beginning bargaining, the school board of a city or borough school district or a regional educational attendance area shall provide opportunities for public comment on the issues to be addressed in the collective bargaining process. Initial proposals, last-best-offer proposals, tentative agreements before ratification, and final agreements reached by the parties are public documents and are subject to inspection and copying under AS 40.25.110§40.25.140.

###### Sec. 23.40.240.   Effect on certain units, representatives, and agreements.

Nothing in this chapter terminates or modifies a collective bargaining unit, recognition of exclusive bargaining representative, or collective bargaining agreement if the unit, recognition, or agreement is in effect on September 5, 1972.

###### Sec. 23.40.245.   Postsecondary student involvement in collective bargaining.

(a) When a bargaining unit includes members of the faculty or other employees of a public institution of postsecondary education, the public employer and the representative of the bargaining unit shall permit student representatives of that institution to

(1) attend and observe all meetings between the public employer and the representative of the bargaining unit which are involved with collective bargaining;

(2) have access to all documents pertaining to collective bargaining exchanged by the employer and the representative of the bargaining unit, including copies of transcripts of the meetings.

(b) Student representatives may not disclose information concerning the substance of collective bargaining obtained in the course of their activities under (a) of this section, unless that information is released by the employer or the representative of the bargaining unit.

(c) For the purpose of this section, the students of the institution involved in negotiations shall select their representatives from the institution directly involved in negotiations.

(d) When the institutions are negotiating with bargaining units representing more than one major geographic area of the state, the student representatives shall be from those areas.  No more than three student representatives may attend meetings at any time.

###### Sec. 23.45.010.   [Renumbered as AS 23.90.900.]

## Chapter 50. Collective Negotiation by Physicians.

###### Sec. 23.50.010.   Legislative findings.

(a) The legislature finds that permitting competing physicians to engage in collective negotiation of certain terms and conditions of contracts with a health benefit plan will benefit competition, so long as the physicians do not engage in an express or implied threat of retaliatory collective action, including boycotts or strikes.

(b) The legislature finds that permitting physicians to engage in collective negotiations over fee-related terms may, in some circumstances, yield anticompetitive effects. There are, however, instances in which a health benefit plan dominates the market to the degree that fair negotiations between physicians and the health benefit plan are not possible in the absence of joint action on behalf of the physicians. In those circumstances, the health benefit plan can virtually dictate the terms of the contracts that it offers to physicians.

(c) The legislature finds that it is appropriate and necessary to authorize collective negotiations between competing physicians and health benefit plans when the imbalances in bargaining capacity described in this section exist.

###### Sec. 23.50.020.   Collective action by competing physicians.

(a) Competing physicians may meet and communicate in order to collectively negotiate with a health benefit plan concerning any of the contract terms and conditions described in this subsection, but may not negotiate the exclusion of providers who are non-physicians from direct reimbursement by a health benefit plan, and may not negotiate the setting in which providers who are non-physicians deliver services. Competing physicians may not engage in a boycott related to these terms and conditions. Competing physicians may meet and communicate concerning

(1) physician clinical practice guidelines and coverage criteria;

(2) the respective liability of physicians and the health benefit plan for the treatment or lack of treatment of insured or enrolled persons;

(3) administrative procedures, including methods and timing of the payment of services to physicians;

(4) procedures for the resolution of disputes between the health benefit plan and physicians;

(5) patient referral procedures;

(6) the formulation and application of reimbursement methodology;

(7) quality assurance programs;

(8) health service utilization review procedures; and

(9) criteria to be used by health benefit plans for the selection and termination of physicians, including whether to engage in selective contracting.

(b) An authorized third party that intends to negotiate with a health benefit plan the items identified under (a) of this section shall provide the attorney general with written notice of the intended negotiations before the negotiations begin.

(c) In exercising the collective rights granted by (a) of this section,

(3) the authorized third party is the sole party authorized to negotiate with a health benefit plan on behalf of a defined group of physicians;

(4) physicians can be bound by the terms and conditions negotiated by the authorized third party that represents their interests;

(5) a health benefit plan communicating or negotiating with the authorized third party may contract with, or offer different contract terms and conditions to, individual competing physicians;

(6) an authorized third party may not represent more than 30 percent of the market of practicing physicians for the provision of services in the geographic service area or proposed geographic service area, if the health benefit plan has less than a five percent market share as determined by the number of covered lives as reported by the director of insurance for the most recently completed calendar year or by the actual number of consumers of prepaid comprehensive health services; in this paragraph, "covered lives" means the total number of individuals who are entitled to benefits under the health benefit plan;

(7) the attorney general may limit the percentage of practicing physicians represented by an authorized third party; however, the limitation may not be less than 30 percent of the market of practicing physicians in the geographic service area or proposed geographic service area; when determining whether to impose a limitation described under this paragraph, the attorney general shall consider the provisions described under (f)§(h) of this section; this paragraph does not apply if the market of practicing physicians in the geographic service area or proposed geographic service area consists of 40 or fewer individuals; and

(8) the authorized third party shall comply with the provisions of (d) of this section.

(d) A person acting or proposing to act as an authorized third party under this section shall,

(1) before engaging in collective negotiations with a health benefit plan,

(A) file with the attorney general the information that identifies the authorized third party, the physicians represented by the third party, the authorized third party's plan of operation, and the authorized third party's procedures to ensure compliance with this section;

(B) furnish to the attorney general, for the attorney general's approval, a brief report that identifies the proposed subject matter of the negotiations or discussions with a health benefit plan and that contains an explanation of the efficiencies or benefits that are expected to be achieved through the collective negotiations; the attorney general shall review whether the group of physicians represented by the authorized third party is appropriate to represent the interests involved in the negotiations; the attorney general may not approve the report if the group of physicians is not appropriate to represent the interests involved in the negotiations or if the proposed negotiations exceed the authority granted in this chapter and, if the group is not appropriate or the negotiations exceed the granted authority, shall enter an order prohibiting the collective negotiations from proceeding; the authorized third party shall provide supplemental information to the attorney general as new information becomes available that indicates that the subject matter of negotiations with the health benefit plan has changed or will change;

(2) within 14 days after receiving a health benefit plan's decision to decline to negotiate or to terminate negotiations, or within 14 days after requesting negotiations with a health benefit plan that fails to respond within that time, report to the attorney general that negotiations have ended or have been declined;

(3) during the negotiation process, provide the attorney general upon the attorney general's request with a copy of all written communications that are between physicians and the health benefit plan, that are relevant to the negotiations, and that are in the possession of the authorized third party;

(e) The attorney general shall either approve or disapprove the contract that was the subject of the collective negotiation within 60 days after receiving the reports required under (d) of this section. If the contract is disapproved, the attorney general shall furnish a written explanation of any deficiencies along with a statement of specific remedial measures that would correct any identified deficiencies. An authorized third party who fails to obtain the attorney general's approval is considered to be acting outside the authority of this section.

(f) The attorney general shall approve a collective negotiation contract if

(1) the competitive and other benefits of the contract terms outweigh any anticompetitive effects; and

(2) the contract terms are consistent with other applicable laws and regulations.

(g) The competitive and other benefits of joint negotiations or negotiated provider contract terms must include

(1) restoration of the competitive balance in the market for health care services;

(2) protections for access to quality patient care;

(3) promotion of health care infrastructure and medical advancement; or

(4) improved communications between health care providers and health care insurers.

(h) When weighing the anticompetitive effects of contract terms, the attorney general shall consider whether the terms

(1) provide for excessive payments; or

(2) contribute to the escalation of the cost of providing health care services.

(i) This section does not authorize competing physicians to act in concert in response to a report issued by an authorized third party related to the authorized third party's discussion or negotiations with a health benefit plan. The authorized third party shall advise the physicians of the provisions of this subsection and shall warn them of the potential for legal action against those who violate state or federal antitrust laws by exceeding the authority granted under this section.

(j) A contract allowed under this section may not exceed a term of five years.

(k) The documents relating to a collective negotiation described under this section that are in the possession of the Department of Law are confidential and not open to public inspection.

(l) Nothing in this section shall be construed as exempting from the application of the antitrust laws the conduct of providers or negotiations or agreements between providers and a health benefit plan if the purpose or effect of the conduct, negotiations, or agreements would be, directly or indirectly, to exclude, limit the participation or reimbursement of, or otherwise limit the scope of services to be provided by separate or competing classes of providers who practice or seek to practice within the scope of the occupational licenses held by the providers.

(m) A contract entered into under this section must be consistent with AS 21.36.090(d).

(2) "provider" has the meaning given in AS 21.36.090(d).

###### Sec. 23.50.030.   Fee for registration of authorized third parties.

(a) The attorney general shall adopt regulations that establish the amount and manner of payment of a registration fee for authorized third parties. The attorney general shall establish the fee level so that the total amount of fees collected from authorized third parties approximately equals the actual regulatory costs for the oversight of joint negotiations between physicians and health benefit plans. The attorney general shall annually review the fee level to determine whether the regulatory costs are approximately equal to fee collections. If the review indicates that the fee collections and regulatory costs are not approximately equal, the attorney general shall calculate fee adjustments and adopt regulations under this subsection to implement the adjustments. In January of each year, the attorney general shall report on the fee level and revisions for the previous year under this subsection to the office of management and budget.

(b) In this section, "regulatory costs" means costs of the Department of Law that are attributable to oversight of joint negotiations between physicians and health benefit plans.
