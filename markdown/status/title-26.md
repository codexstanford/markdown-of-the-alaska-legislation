###### Sec. 26.05.570.   Voting and rulings.

(a) Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the findings and on the sentence shall be by secret written ballot. The junior member of the court shall count the votes. The count shall be checked by the president, who shall immediately announce the result of the ballot to the members of the court on the record, in an open court, and in the presence of all parties to the trial.

(b) The military judge shall rule on all questions of law and all interlocutory questions arising during the proceedings. A ruling made by the military judge on a question of law or an interlocutory question, other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused, is final and constitutes the ruling of the court. However, the military judge may change the ruling at any time during the trial before a vote is taken on the findings. Unless the ruling is final, if a member objects to a ruling, the court shall be cleared and closed, and the question shall be decided by a voice vote as provided in AS 26.05.575, beginning with the junior in rank.

(c) Before a vote is taken on the findings, the military judge shall, in the presence of the accused and counsel, instruct the members of the court as to the elements of the offense under this chapter and charge them that

(1) the accused is presumed to be innocent until the guilt of the accused is established by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt;

(2) if there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused, and the accused must be acquitted;

(3) if there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, a finding of guilt must be in a lower degree as to which there is no reasonable doubt; and

(4) the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt is on the state.

(d) A military judge sitting without court members shall

(1) determine all questions of law and fact arising during the proceedings and, if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate sentence;

(2) make a general finding and shall, in addition, on request, find the facts specially.

(e) If a military judge sitting without court members files an opinion or memorandum of decision, the opinion or memorandum of decision is sufficient if the findings of fact appear in the opinion or memorandum of decision.

###### Sec. 26.05.575.   Number of votes required.

(a) A person may not be convicted of an offense under this chapter that is tried by a court-martial unless by the unanimous verdict of the members of the court present at the time the vote is taken.

(b) All other questions to be decided by the members of a general or special court-martial shall be determined by a majority vote, but a determination to reconsider a finding of guilty or to reconsider a sentence, with a view toward decreasing it, may be made by any lesser vote that indicates that the reconsideration is not opposed by the number of votes required for that finding or sentence. A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member challenged. A tie vote on any other question is a determination in favor of the accused.

###### Sec. 26.05.580.   Record of trial.

(a) Each general and special court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings in each case brought before it, and the record must be authenticated by the signature of the military judge. If the military judge cannot authenticate the record because of the military judge's death, disability, or absence, the record shall be authenticated by the signature of the trial counsel or, if the trial counsel is unable to authenticate the record because of the trial counsel's death, disability, or absence, then by the signature of a member of the court. In a court-martial consisting of only a military judge, the record shall be authenticated by the court reporter under the same conditions that would impose a duty on a member under this subsection.

(b) In each general and special court-martial case resulting in a conviction, a complete verbatim record of the proceedings and testimony shall be prepared. In all other court-martial cases, the record must contain the matters as may be prescribed by rules of procedure.

(c) Each summary court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings in each case, and the record shall be authenticated in the manner as may be prescribed by rules of procedure.

(d) A copy of the record of the proceedings of each general and special court-martial shall be given to the accused as soon as the record is authenticated.

###### Sec. 26.05.585.   Cruel and unusual punishments prohibited.

A court-martial may not impose on a member of the militia punishment by flogging, branding, marking, or tattooing on the body, or another cruel or unusual punishment. The use of irons, single or double, except for the purpose of safe custody, is prohibited.

###### Sec. 26.05.590.   Punishments; maximum limits.

(a) A court-martial may not impose a punishment that exceeds the limits set out in the code of military justice and may not impose a sentence of death. A sentence of confinement imposed under this chapter may not exceed 10 years. An offense under this chapter that is punishable by a term of confinement of more than one year is a felony offense. Except for convictions by a summary court-martial and except as otherwise specifically provided in the code of military justice, all other offenses under this chapter are misdemeanors. A conviction by a summary court-martial is a violation.

(b) A nonjudicial punishment may not include a sentence of confinement or separation from military service.

###### Sec. 26.05.595.   Deferment of sentences.

(a) If an accused is under sentence to confinement that has not yet been ordered executed, the convening authority or, if the accused is no longer under the convening authority's jurisdiction, the person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently detailed may, in that person's sole discretion, defer service of the sentence to confinement. The deferment terminates when the sentence is ordered to be executed. The deferment may be rescinded at any time by the authority who granted it or, if the accused is no longer under that person's jurisdiction, by the person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently detailed.

(b) If a court-martial sentences an accused to confinement, the convening authority may, without the consent of the accused, defer the service of the sentence until after the accused has been permanently released to the militia of the state by a state, the United States, or a foreign country

(1) that had custody of the accused;

(2) that temporarily returned the accused to the militia of the state for trial by court-martial; and

(3) to which, after the court-martial, the militia of the state returned the accused under the authority of a mutual agreement or treaty.

(c) In a case in which a court-martial sentences an accused to confinement and the sentence to confinement has been ordered executed, but in which review of the case under AS 26.05.615, 26.05.640, or 26.05.645 is pending, the adjutant general may defer further service of the sentence to confinement while that review is pending.

(d) In (b) of this section, "state" includes the District of Columbia and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.

###### Sec. 26.05.600.   Execution of confinement.

A person must serve a sentence of confinement imposed by a court-martial, whether or not the sentence includes discharge or dismissal from the militia of the state, and whether or not the discharge or dismissal has been executed. The sentence may be carried into execution by confinement in a place authorized by the code of military justice. A person confined under the code of military justice is subject to the same discipline and treatment as other persons confined or committed to the place of confinement.

###### Sec. 26.05.605.   Error of law; lesser included offense.

(a) A finding or sentence of a court-martial may not be held incorrect on the ground of an error of law unless the error materially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused.

###### Sec. 26.05.610.   Withdrawal of appeal.

In a case subject to appellate review under the code of military justice, the accused may, at any time, file with the convening authority a written statement expressly withdrawing the right of the accused to the appeal. The withdrawal shall be signed by both the accused and the accused's defense counsel and filed in accordance with rules of procedure.

###### Sec. 26.05.615.   Appeal by the state.

(a) In a trial by court-martial in which a punitive discharge may be imposed, the state may appeal to the Military Appeals Commission established under this chapter

(1) an order or ruling of the military judge that terminates the proceedings with respect to a charge or specification;

(2) an order or ruling that excludes evidence that is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding;

(3) an order or ruling that directs the disclosure of classified information;

(4) an order or ruling that imposes sanctions for nondisclosure of classified information;

(5) the refusal of the military judge to issue a protective order sought by the prosecution to prevent the disclosure of classified information;

(6) the refusal of the military judge to enforce an order issued under (5) of this subsection that was previously issued by an appropriate authority.

(b) An appeal of an order or ruling may not be taken unless the trial counsel provides the military judge with written notice of appeal from the order or ruling within 72 hours after the order or ruling. The notice must include a certification by the trial counsel that the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay and, if the order or ruling appealed is one that excludes evidence, that the evidence excluded is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.

The probationer shall be represented at the hearing by military counsel if the probationer requests representation.

(b) If the suspended sentence was imposed by a special court-martial, the officer having special court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer shall hold a hearing on the alleged violation of probation. The record of the hearing and the recommendation of the officer having special court-martial jurisdiction shall be sent for action to the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer. If the officer vacates the suspension, the unexecuted part of the sentence, except a dismissal, shall be executed, subject to applicable restrictions in the code of military justice.

(c) The suspension of another sentence may be vacated by an authority for the command in which the accused is serving or detailed who is competent to convene a court of the kind that imposed the sentence.

###### Sec. 26.05.625.   Petition for a new trial.

At any time within two years after approval by the convening authority of a court-martial sentence, the accused may petition the adjutant general for a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence or fraud on the court-martial.

###### Sec. 26.05.630.   Restoration.

(a) All rights, privileges, and property affected by an executed part of a court-martial sentence that has been set aside or disapproved, except an executed dismissal or discharge, shall be restored unless a new trial or rehearing is ordered and the executed part is included in a sentence imposed on the new trial or rehearing.

(b) If a previously executed sentence of dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge is not imposed on a new trial, the governor may substitute an administrative form of discharge unless the accused is to serve out the remainder of the accused's enlistment.

(c) If a previously executed sentence of dismissal is not imposed on a new trial, the governor may substitute an administrative form of discharge, and a commissioned officer dismissed under the original sentence may be reappointed by the governor alone to the commissioned grade and rank that, in the opinion of the governor, the former officer would have attained had the officer not been dismissed. The reappointment of the former officer shall be without regard to the existence of a vacancy and shall affect the promotion status of other officers only to the extent the governor may direct. The time between the dismissal and the reappointment shall be considered as actual service for all purposes, including the right to pay and allowances.

###### Sec. 26.05.635.   Leave required to be taken pending review of court-martial convictions.

In accordance with rules adopted under AS 26.05.360, an accused who has been sentenced by a court-martial may be required to take leave pending completion of action under this chapter if the sentence includes an unsuspended dismissal or an unsuspended dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge. The accused may be required to begin the leave on the date on which the sentence is approved under the code of military justice, or at any time after that date, and the leave may be continued until the date on which action under this chapter is completed, or may be terminated at an earlier time.

(c) If the governor finds that a disaster has occurred or that a disaster is imminent or threatened, the governor shall, by proclamation, declare a condition of disaster emergency. The disaster emergency remains in effect until the governor finds that the danger has passed or the disaster has been dealt with so that the emergency no longer exists. The governor may terminate the disaster emergency by proclamation. A proclamation of disaster emergency may not remain in effect longer than 30 days unless extended by the legislature by a concurrent resolution. The proclamation must indicate the nature of the disaster, the area threatened or affected, and the conditions that have brought it about or that make possible the termination of the disaster emergency. A proclamation to declare a condition of disaster emergency must also state whether the governor proposes to expend state funds to respond to the disaster under (i) or (j) of this section.

(d) An order or proclamation issued under  AS 26.23.010§ 26.23.220 shall be disseminated promptly by means calculated to bring its contents to the attention of the general public and, unless prevented or impeded by circumstances attendant upon the disaster, promptly filed with the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management, the lieutenant governor, and the municipal clerk in the area to which it applies.

(e) A proclamation of a disaster emergency activates the disaster response and recovery aspects of the state, local, and interjurisdictional disaster emergency plans applicable to the political subdivisions or areas in question, and constitutes authority for the deployment and use of any force to which the plan or plans apply and for use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, materials, and facilities assembled, stockpiled, or arranged to be made available under  AS 26.23.010§ 26.23.220 or any other provision of law relating to disaster emergency response.

(f) During the effective period of a disaster emergency, the governor is commander in chief of the organized and unorganized militia and of all other forces available for emergency duty. The governor may delegate or assign command authority by appropriate orders or regulations.

(g) In addition to any other powers conferred upon the governor by law, the governor may, under  AS 26.23.010§ 26.23.220,

(1) suspend the provisions of any regulatory statute prescribing procedures for the conduct of state business, or the orders or regulations of any state agency, if compliance with the provisions of the statute, order, or regulation would prevent, or substantially impede or delay, action necessary to cope with the disaster emergency;

(2) use all available resources of the state government and of each political subdivision of the state as reasonably necessary to cope with the disaster emergency;

(3) transfer personnel or alter the functions of state departments and agencies or units of them for the purpose of performing or facilitating the performance of disaster emergency services;

(4) subject to any applicable requirements for compensation under  AS 26.23.160, commandeer or utilize any private property, except for all news media other than as specifically provided for in  AS 26.23.010§ 26.23.220, if the governor considers this necessary to cope with the disaster emergency;

(5) direct and compel the relocation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area in the state if the governor considers relocation necessary for the preservation of life or for other disaster mitigation purpose;

(9) make provisions for the availability and use of temporary emergency housing;

(10) allocate or redistribute food, water, fuel, clothing, medicine, or supplies; and

(11) use money from the oil and hazardous substance release response account in the oil and hazardous substance release prevention and response fund, established by  AS 46.08.010, to respond to a declared disaster emergency related to an oil or hazardous substance discharge.

(h) The governor may expend during a fiscal year not more than $500,000 of state funds per incident to prevent, minimize, or respond to the effects of an incident that may occur or occurs in the state and that, in the determination of the governor, poses a direct and imminent threat of sufficient magnitude and severity to justify state action. Before expending funds under this subsection to respond to an incident, the governor shall provide a financing plan to cope with the incident to the legislature in the same manner prescribed for disaster emergencies under  AS 26.23.025(a).

(i) If the governor declares a condition of disaster emergency, the governor may expend during a fiscal year not more than $1,000,000 of state funds per disaster declaration, including the assets of the disaster relief fund, to

(1) save lives, protect property and public health and safety, or lessen or avert the threat of the disaster that poses a direct and imminent threat of sufficient severity and magnitude to justify state action;

(2) implement provisions of law relating to disaster relief to cope with the disaster;

(3) alleviate the effects of the disaster by making grants or loans to persons or political subdivisions on terms the governor considers appropriate or by other means the governor considers appropriate.

(2) if the legislature is not in session, either

(A) the governor convenes a special session of the legislature within five days after declaring the condition of disaster emergency or within five days after providing a financing plan to cope with an incident to the legislature and the legislature convenes in special session and approves a financing plan to cope with the incident or disaster that identifies the amount in excess of the expenditure limits that is to be expended from state funds; or

(B) the presiding officers of both the house of representatives and the senate agree that a special session should not be convened and so advise the governor in writing.

###### Sec. 26.23.025.   The legislature and disaster emergencies.

(a) When the governor declares a condition of disaster emergency under AS 26.23.020(c), concurrently with the issuance of the proclamation, the governor shall prepare and deliver to the presiding officers of the legislature and to the persons who chair the finance committees in each house of the legislature a financing plan describing the amount by fund source of money, including the amount of state match for federal funds, that the governor proposes to use to cope with the disaster, the estimated total expenditures necessary to cope with the disaster, and the estimated time frame necessary to cope with the disaster.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the declaration of a disaster emergency occurs while the legislature is in session or if a special session is held, actions taken by the governor under this chapter after the close of the session that are not ratified by law adopted during that session are void.

(c) The legislature may terminate a disaster emergency at any time by law.

(b) The department may maintain emergency response depots in areas of the state identified for that purpose in the state emergency plan developed under AS 26.23.040. The depots shall be equipped in a manner that enables prompt response to emergencies and disasters.

###### Sec. 26.23.050.   Financing.

(a) It is the intent of the legislature, and declared to be the policy of the state, that funds to meet disaster emergencies will always be available.

(b) Whenever, and to the extent that, money is needed to cope with a disaster, the first recourse shall be to money regularly appropriated to state and local agencies. The second recourse shall be to money available in the disaster relief fund or, for oil or hazardous substances discharges, the oil and hazardous substance release prevention and response fund, as the governor determines appropriate. If money available from these sources is insufficient, and if the governor finds that other sources of money to cope with the disaster are not available or are insufficient, the governor may, notwithstanding the limitations imposed by AS 37.07.080(e),

(1) transfer and spend money appropriated for other purposes; or

(2) borrow money for a term not to exceed two years.

(c) Nothing in this section limits the governor's authority to apply for, receive, administer, and spend grants, gifts, or payments from any source, to aid in disaster prevention, preparedness, response, or recovery.

(a) Each political subdivision in the state is within the jurisdiction of, and shall be served by, the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management.

(b) Each political subdivision is responsible for disaster preparedness and coordination of response

(1) by itself;

(2) in conjunction with other political subdivisions by establishing an interjurisdictional planning and service area under  AS 26.23.070; or

(3) in conjunction with the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management.

(c) Each political subdivision that has not established the ability to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters shall designate, and provide to the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management the name of, a liaison officer to facilitate the cooperation and protection of that political subdivision in the work of disaster prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.

(d) The principal executive officer of each political subdivision in the state shall notify the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management of the manner in which the political subdivision is providing or securing disaster planning and intends to provide or secure emergency services, identify the person who heads the agency from which the services are or will be obtained, and furnish additional information relating to the services as the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management requires.

(e) Each political subdivision shall ensure that a written local or interjurisdictional disaster emergency plan for its area is prepared, maintained, and distributed to all appropriate officials. The disaster emergency plan must include a clear and complete statement of the emergency responsibilities of all local agencies and officials.

(f)    [Repealed,§28 ch 32 SLA 1994.]

(g) To the extent that a plan prepared under this section relates to action required to avert human injury or other damage from a release of a hazardous substance, the plan must be substantially equivalent in relevant respects, including the use of a comparable incident command system, to the local emergency plans prepared under  AS 26.23.073 and  26.23.075 and the state and regional master plans prepared by the Department of Environmental Conservation under  AS 46.04.200§ 46.04.210. The plan must use an incident command system comparable to the system used in those plans and must be reviewed by the Alaska State Emergency Response Commission under  AS 26.23.077.

(h) Notwithstanding the definition of "political subdivision" in  AS 26.23.900, this section does not empower a political subdivision to perform responsibilities that it is not otherwise empowered to perform. In this section, "political subdivision" includes only a political subdivision that is otherwise empowered to perform the responsibilities assigned under this section.

###### Sec. 26.23.070.   Establishment of interjurisdictional disaster planning and service areas.

(a) If the governor finds that two or more adjoining political subdivisions would be better served by an interjurisdictional arrangement than by maintaining separate disaster agencies and services, the governor may designate by order an interjurisdictional area adequate to plan for, prevent, or respond to a disaster in that area, and direct steps to be taken as necessary, including the creation of an interjurisdictional relationship, a joint disaster emergency plan, mutual aid, or an area organization for emergency planning and services.  A finding by the governor under this subsection must be based on one or more factors related to the difficulty of maintaining an efficient and effective disaster prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery system without an interjurisdictional relationship, such as

(1) small or sparse population;

(2) limitations on public financial resources severe enough to make maintenance of a separate disaster agency and services unreasonably burdensome;

(3) unusual vulnerability to disaster as evidenced by a past history of disasters, topographical features, drainage characteristics, disaster potential, and presence of disaster-prone facilities or operations;

(4) the interrelated character of the political subdivisions in an area; or

(5) other relevant conditions or circumstances.

(b) If the governor finds that a vulnerable area lies only partly within the state and includes territory in a foreign jurisdiction, and that it would be desirable to establish an international relationship, mutual aid, or an area organization for disaster, the governor shall take steps to that end as desirable. If this action is taken with jurisdictions that have enacted the Emergency Management Assistance Compact substantially as contained in AS 26.23.136, any resulting agreement may be considered a supplementary agreement under Article VII of that compact.

(c) If a jurisdiction with which the governor proposes to cooperate under (b) of this section has not enacted the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, the governor may negotiate a special agreement with that jurisdiction.

(d) To the extent that a plan prepared under this section relates to action required to avert human injury or other damage from a release of a hazardous substance, the plan must be substantially equivalent in relevant respect to the local emergency plans prepared under AS 26.23.073 and 26.23.075 and the state and regional master plans prepared by the Department of Environmental Conservation under AS 46.04.200§46.04.210. The plan must use an incident command system comparable to the system used in those plans and must be reviewed by the Alaska State Emergency Response Commission under AS 26.23.077.

###### Sec. 26.23.071.   Alaska State Emergency Response Commission.

(a) The Alaska State Emergency Response Commission is established in the Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs.

Two of the other three members of the public who are appointed to the commission must be members of the governing body of, or the mayor of, a political subdivision that has a local emergency planning committee or a person who, in the opinion of the governor, is otherwise appropriate to represent the political subdivision. The United States Department of Defense§Alaska Command, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Coast Guard may each appoint a representative to serve on the commission in an ex-officio, nonvoting capacity. To the extent practicable, the commission must include members with expertise in the emergency response field.

(c) The adjutant general of the Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs, or the adjutant general's designee, and the commissioner of environmental conservation, or the commissioner's designee, shall co-chair the commission. The Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs shall provide staff support to the commission.

(d) Members of the commission other than those from the designated state departments serve at the pleasure of the governor for staggered terms of three years. Members of the commission serve without compensation but are entitled to per diem and travel expenses authorized for members of boards and commissions under AS 39.20.180.

(e) The commission shall

(1) serve as the state emergency response commission required under 42 U.S.C. 11001§11005;

(2) facilitate the preparation and implementation of all emergency plans prepared by state agencies under other authorities; the statewide, interjurisdictional, and local plans prepared under this chapter, including the Alaska intrastate mutual aid system; and the state and regional plans prepared under AS 46.04.200§46.04.210;

(8) review reports about responses to disaster emergencies and make recommendations to the appropriate parties involved in the response concerning improved prevention and preparedness;

(9) perform other coordinating, advisory, or planning tasks related to emergency planning and preparedness for all types of hazards, community right-to-know reporting, toxic chemical release reporting, or management of hazardous substances;

(10) recommend procedures to integrate, as appropriate, hazardous substance response planning under 42 U.S.C. 11001§11005, federal contingency planning under 33 U.S.C. 1321 and other federal laws applicable to hazardous substance discharges, and state, regional, and local planning under this chapter and AS 46.04.200§46.04.210;

(11) to the extent consistent with the constitution and law of the state, perform all other functions prescribed for state emergency response commissions under 42 U.S.C. 11001§11005; and

###### Sec. 26.23.073.   Emergency planning districts and committees.

(a) The commission shall set the boundaries of local emergency planning districts. The commission shall set the boundaries of a district so that they are coextensive with the boundaries of a single political subdivision except when it would be more appropriate, based on findings of the commission, for the district to include more than one political subdivision or some area that is not contained within a political subdivision. Before the commission sets the boundaries for a district under this subsection so that it includes more than one political subdivision or some area that is not within a political subdivision, the commission shall consult the emergency response organizations and the political subdivisions in the proposed district.

(b) If, after the commission sets boundaries for districts under (a) of this section, there remain areas of the state that are not included in any district, those areas constitute a local emergency planning district.

(c) If the commission sets boundaries for a district under this section that includes more than one political subdivision, the commission shall recommend to the governor the designation of an interjurisdictional disaster planning and service area under AS 26.23.070 whose boundaries are coextensive with the boundaries of the local emergency planning district established under this section.

(d) The commission shall appoint the members of a local emergency planning committee for each emergency planning district established under (a) and (b) of this section. In making appointments for a district that contains only one political subdivision, the commission shall follow the recommendations of the political subdivision if those recommendations would constitute a committee that meets the requirements of this subsection. In making appointments for a district that contains more than one political subdivision, the commission shall consider the recommendations of each political subdivision and follow the recommendations to the extent that the political subdivisions are in agreement and their recommendations would constitute a committee that meets the requirements of this subsection. To the extent required under regulations that may be adopted by the commission, the political subdivisions in a district that includes more than one political subdivision shall follow a process under which they develop coordinated recommendations to submit to the commission under this subsection. In making appointments for a district that includes some area that is not contained within a political subdivision, the commission shall consider the recommendations of emergency response organizations in the district. In making appointments for the district formed under (b) of this section, the commission shall attempt to achieve equitable geographical representation on the committee. Except as provided in (e) of this section, each committee must include, at a minimum, representatives of each of the following seven categories:

(1) elected local officials;

(2) law enforcement, civil defense, fire fighting, first aid, health, local environmental, hospital, and transportation personnel;

(3) broadcast or print media;

(4) community groups;

(5) owners and operators of facilities subject to the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 11001§11005;

(6) representatives of a local or interjurisdictional disaster planning and service area if one has been established that includes part of the district; and

(7) members of the public that are not described in (1)§(6) of this subsection.

(e) If advertisement and the commission's own initiative do not result in the acceptance of appointment to a committee by at least one person from a category under (d)(1)§(7) of this section, the requirement of (d) of this section that there be representation of that category on that committee is suspended until sufficient willing appointees become available.

(f) A person may request the commission to change the membership of a local emergency planning committee.

(g) Each local emergency planning committee shall

(1) establish procedures for receiving and processing requests from the public for information under 42 U.S.C. 11044, including tier II information under 42 U.S.C. 11022;

(2) appoint a chair and establish rules by which the committee shall function, including provisions for public notification of committee activities, public advertising of positions available on the committee, public meetings to discuss the emergency plan, public comments, response to the comments by the committee, distribution of the emergency plan, and designation of an official to serve as coordinator for information;

(3) prepare and periodically review an emergency plan in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 11003(a) in a manner that includes coordination with the political subdivisions covered by the plan;

(4) evaluate the need for resources necessary to develop, implement, and exercise the emergency plan, and submit recommendations to the political subdivisions in the emergency planning district with respect to the resources that may be required and the means for providing the resources;

(5) to the extent consistent with the constitution and law of the state, perform all other functions prescribed for emergency planning committees in 42 U.S.C. 11001§11005;

(6) to the extent considered advisable by the committee, make recommendations to political subdivisions, representatives of interjurisdictional disaster planning and service areas, and state agencies about the preparation of local, state, and interjurisdictional plans; and

(7) serve as an advisory committee to the political subdivisions within the emergency planning district or the interjurisdictional planning and service area established under AS 26.23.070 with respect to emergency planning, training, and response.

(h) A state agency represented on the commission shall, upon request, provide technical assistance to a local emergency planning committee in the performance of its duties under this section.

###### Secs. 26.23.120 §26.23.130.   Interstate Civil Defense and Disaster Compact entered into; compact terms. [Repealed,§5 ch 55 SLA 2002.]

###### Sec. 26.23.135.   Emergency Management Assistance Compact enacted and entered into.

The Emergency Management Assistance Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining in it in a form substantially as contained in AS 26.23.136.

###### Sec. 26.23.136.   Compact terms.

The terms and provisions of the compact referred to in AS 26.23.135 are as follows:

EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT

This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states that enact this compact, which are called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, "states" means the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.

The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is declared by the governor of the affected state or states, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.

This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.

Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdiction boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies that require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources that they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.

The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state is the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact are understood.

On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management is responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.

(a) It is the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall

(1) review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, civil disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack;

(2) review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan that will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency;

(3) develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans;

(4) assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries;

(5) protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both human and material;

(6) inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness; and

(7) provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the responsibilities listed in (1)§(6) of this subsection.

(b) The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this agreement only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within 30 days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information:

(1) a description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, such as, but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue;

(2) the amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed; and

(3) the specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location.

(c) There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States government, with free exchange of information, plans, and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.

Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms of the compact; however, it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state. Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers, except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state; duties; rights; and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving state or states, whichever is longest.

Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, whenever any person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, the person is deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such a skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to the limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by proclamation or otherwise.

Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state under this compact are considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes; and a party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state in accordance with this compact is not liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection with the rendering of that aid. Good faith in this article does not include wilful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness.

Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party to the compact, this instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing contained in the compact precludes any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affects any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but are not limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.

Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case those members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid under this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.

Any party state rendering aid in another state under this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving the aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such a request; however, any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part the loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan equipment or donate services to the receiving party state without charge or cost and, further, any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses are not reimbursable under this provision.

Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant, shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management or services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. The plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting the evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of the evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. The plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for the evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of the evacuees.

(a) This compact becomes operative immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states; after that, this compact becomes effective as to any other state upon its enactment by that state.

(b) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the compact, but the withdrawal does not take effect until 30 days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. The action does not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed under the compact before the effective date of withdrawal.

(c) Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of any supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States government.

This Act shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I of this compact. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional, or the applicability of the compact to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact and the applicability of the compact to other persons and circumstances are not affected by the invalidity of any provision of the compact.

Nothing in this compact authorizes or permits the use of military force by the National Guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the President is authorized by law to call into federal service the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the Army or the Air Force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under 18 U.S.C. 1385.

###### Sec. 26.23.140.   Local disaster emergencies.

(a) A local disaster emergency may be declared only by the principal executive officer of a political subdivision. It may not be continued or renewed for a period in excess of seven days, except by or with the consent of the governing board of the political subdivision. An order or proclamation declaring, continuing, or terminating a local disaster emergency shall be given prompt and general publicity, and shall be filed promptly with the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management and the appropriate municipal clerk.

(b) The effect of a declaration of a local disaster emergency is to activate the response and recovery aspects of any and all applicable local or interjurisdictional disaster emergency plans, and to authorize the furnishing of aid and assistance under those plans.

(c) A representative of an interjurisdictional disaster planning and service area may not declare a local disaster emergency unless expressly authorized by the principal executive officer of each political subdivision in the emergency area.

###### Sec. 26.23.150.   Disaster prevention.

(a) In addition to disaster prevention measures as included in the state, local, and interjurisdictional disaster plans, the governor shall consider, on a continuing basis, steps that could be taken to prevent or reduce the harmful consequences of disasters. At the governor's direction, and under any other authority and competence they have, state agencies, including but not limited to those charged with responsibilities in connection with flood plain management, stream encroachment and flow regulation, weather modification, fire prevention and control, environmental quality, public works, land use and land use planning, and construction standards, shall make studies of disaster-prevention-related matters. The governor, from time to time, shall make recommendations to the legislature, local governments, and other appropriate public and private entities as may facilitate measures for the prevention or reduction of the harmful consequences of disasters.

(b) Appropriate departments, in conjunction with the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management, shall keep land uses and location of structures and other facilities under continuing study, and identify areas that are particularly susceptible to severe land shifting, subsidence, flood, or other catastrophic occurrence. The studies under this subsection shall concentrate on means of reducing or avoiding the dangers caused by this occurrence or the consequences of it.

(c) If the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management believes, on the basis of the studies or other competent evidence and after consultation with the appropriate local planning agencies, that an area is susceptible to a disaster of catastrophic proportions without adequate warning, that existing building standards and land use controls in that area are inadequate and could add substantially to the magnitude of the disaster, and that changes in zoning regulations, other land use regulations, or building requirements are essential in order to further the purposes of this section, it shall specify the essential changes to the governor.

###### Sec. 26.23.160.   Compensation.

(a) Personal services may not be compensated by the state or a political subdivision or agency of it, except in accordance with Alaska law or a local ordinance.

(b) Compensation for property shall be made only if the property was commandeered or otherwise used in coping with a disaster emergency, and its use or destruction was ordered by the governor or by a member of the disaster emergency forces of this state who is authorized by the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management to issue such an order.

(c) A person claiming compensation for the use, damage, loss, or destruction of property occasioned by action taken under AS 26.23.010§26.23.220 shall file a claim for that compensation with the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management in the form and manner required by the division.

(d) Unless the amount of compensation resulting from property damaged, lost, or destroyed is agreed upon between the claimant and the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management, the amount of compensation shall be calculated in the same manner as compensation due for a taking of property under the condemnation laws of this state.

###### Sec. 26.23.170.   Communications.

(a) The Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs shall ascertain what means exist for rapid and efficient communications in times of disaster emergency. The department shall consider the desirability of supplementing these communications resources, or of integrating them into a comprehensive state or state-federal telecommunications network or other communication system or network. In studying the character and feasibility of any system or its several parts, the department shall evaluate the possibility of multi-purpose use of it or its parts for general state and local governmental purposes. The department shall make recommendations to the governor as appropriate.

(b) A statewide 911 coordinator is established within the Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs to coordinate and facilitate the implementation of 911 systems throughout the state. The 911 coordinator shall

(1) participate in efforts to set uniform statewide standards for automatic number identification and automatic location identification data transmission for telecommunications systems;

(2) make recommendations as necessary for implementation of basic and enhanced 911 service.

###### Sec. 26.23.180.   Mutual aid.

(a) Political subdivisions not participating in interjurisdictional arrangements under AS 26.23.010§26.23.220 nevertheless shall be encouraged and assisted by the Alaska division of homeland security and emergency management to conclude suitable arrangements for furnishing mutual aid in coping with disasters. The arrangements must include provision of aid by persons and units in public employment.

(b) In concurring with local disaster plans, the governor shall consider whether they contain adequate provisions for the rendering and receipt of mutual aid.

(c) It is a sufficient reason for the governor to require an interjurisdictional agreement or arrangement under AS 26.23.070 that the area involved and political subdivisions in it have available equipment, supplies, and forces necessary to provide mutual aid on a regional basis, and that the political subdivisions have not already made adequate provision for mutual aid; but in requiring an interjurisdictional arrangement in order to accomplish the purpose of this section, the governor need not require establishment and maintenance of an interjurisdictional disaster planning and service area or arrangement for any other disaster purposes.

###### Sec. 26.23.190.   Emergency powers.

(a) If entry is reasonably necessary to actually alleviate or prevent the disaster, all persons authorized to carry out emergency measures directed under the provisions of AS 26.23.010§26.23.220 shall be accorded free access to all public and private land and public buildings within the areas specified, and are authorized to enter them and to perform work and take measures that are appropriate without the consent of the owners of the land or buildings.

(3) affects the jurisdiction or responsibilities of police forces, firefighting forces, units of the armed forces of the United States, or of any personnel of them, when on active duty; but state, local, and interjurisdictional disaster emergency plans shall place reliance upon the forces available for performance of functions related to disaster emergencies;

(4) limits, modifies, or abridges the authority of the governor to proclaim martial law, or exercise any other powers vested in the governor under the constitution, statutes, or common law of this state independent of, or in conjunction with, any provision of AS 26.23.010§26.23.220; or

(5) authorizes the confiscation of a firearm lawfully owned, possessed, or carried by a law-abiding citizen.

(a) In the event of a conflict between this chapter and AS 26.20, including in the event the governor declares a disaster under this chapter due to an attack or credible threat of imminent enemy or terrorist attack as described in AS 26.23.900(2), the provisions of this chapter shall govern.

(b) The provisions of AS 26.20.140, providing for immunity of government, employees, and other authorized persons in certain circumstances, apply when the entities or persons covered by AS 26.20.140 perform duties under AS 26.23.010§26.23.220, except as otherwise provided in AS 26.23.136 for entities or other persons providing assistance to the state under a compact in a form substantially as contained in AS 26.23.136.

###### Sec. 26.25.020.   Terms and provisions of compact.

The terms and provisions of the compact referred to in AS 26.25.010 are as follows:

The purposes of this Compact are to:

(1) provide for mutual aid among the party states in the utilization of the National Guard to cope with emergencies;

(2) permit and encourage a high degree of flexibility in the deployment of National Guard forces in the interest of efficiency;

(3) maximize the effectiveness of the National Guard in those situations that call for its utilization under this Compact; and

(4) provide protection for the rights of National Guard personnel when serving in other states on emergency duty.

(a) This Compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this Compact becomes effective as to any other state upon its enactment in that state.

(b) A party state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing it, but the withdrawal does not take effect until one year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.

(a) In this Article:

(1) "emergency" means an occurrence or condition, temporary in nature, in which police and other public safety officials and locally available National Guard forces are, or may reasonably be expected to be, unable to cope with substantial and imminent danger to the public safety;

(2) "requesting state" means the state whose governor requests assistance in coping with an emergency;

(3) "responding state" means the state furnishing aid, or requested to furnish aid.

(b) Upon request of the governor of a party state for assistance in an emergency, the governor of a responding state has authority under this Compact to send outside the borders of the responding state and place under the temporary command of the appropriate National Guard or other military authorities of the requesting state all or any part of the National Guard forces of the responding state as the governor of the responding state considers necessary, and the exercise of the discretion of the governor of the responding state in this regard is conclusive.

(c) The governor of a party state may withhold the National Guard forces of that state from use outside the state and recall any forces or part or member of forces previously deployed in a requesting state.

(d) Whenever National Guard forces of a party state are engaged in another state in carrying out the purposes of this Compact, the members so engaged have the same powers, duties, rights, privileges and immunities as members of National Guard forces in the other state. The requesting state shall save members of the National Guard forces of responding states harmless from civil liability for acts or omissions in good faith that occur in the performance of their duty while engaged in carrying out the purposes of this Compact, whether the responding forces are serving the requesting state within its borders or are in transit to or from such service.

(e) Subject to the provisions of (f), (g) and (h) of this Article, all liability that may arise under the laws of the requesting state, the responding state, or a third state on account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state.

(f) A responding state rendering aid under this Compact shall be reimbursed by the requesting state for loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of the materials, transportation and maintenance of National Guard personnel and equipment incurred in connection with the request.  However, nothing in the Compact prevents a responding state from assuming the loss, damage, expense or other cost.

(g) Each party state shall provide, in the same amounts and manner as if they were on duty inside their state, for the pay and allowances of the personnel of its National Guard units while engaged outside the state under this Compact and while going to and returning from duty under this Compact.

(h) Each party state providing for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members and the representatives of deceased members of its National Guard forces in case members sustain injuries or are killed inside their own state, shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits in the same manner and on the same terms in case members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this Compact. This compensation and these death benefits are considered items of expense reimbursable under (f) of this Article.

Nothing in this Compact may be construed to prevent the governor of a party state from delegating any of the governor's responsibilities or authority respecting the National Guard, provided that the delegation is otherwise in accordance with law. For purposes of this Compact, however, the governor may not delegate the power to request assistance from another state.

Nothing in this Compact may:

(1) expand or add to the functions of the National Guard, except with respect to the jurisdictions within which the functions may be performed;

(2) authorize or permit National Guard units to be placed under the field command of a person not having the military or National Guard rank or status required by law for the field command position in question.

This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this Compact are severable and if a phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or its applicability to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and its applicability to any government, agency, person or circumstance is not affected thereby.
