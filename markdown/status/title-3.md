The people of each district sponsoring a fair are not eligible for state aid unless they subscribe to spend from their own funds for that purpose an amount equal to the amount of the state aid and have or organize an agricultural and industrial fair association for the operation and maintenance of the fairs. Each fair receiving state aid is open to entries by the people of the whole state, and special provision shall be made for exhibits from boys' and girls' clubs.

(b) An agricultural and industrial fair association qualifying for and applying for operation and maintenance grants may also apply for capital improvement grants.

(c) For the purpose of matching state fair aid allocations, a fair whose local resources are not sufficient to match dollar for dollar may, in preparing its annual report, place a reasonable itemized monetary value on donated labor, materials, and equipment used in the construction, repairing, and maintenance of fairgrounds, buildings, and facilities in place of dollar matching up to 50 percent of its annual requests.  The commissioner shall determine when local resources are insufficient to allow the community to match the amount of state aid requested under (a) of this section, and shall approve the reasonableness of the value assigned the donations by the fair.

(d) Premiums and prizes that qualify for listing for allocation purposes under this section shall be those paid for exhibits and educational contests, displays, and demonstrations of an educational nature. This does not include prizes or premiums for promotion or entertainment activities such as queen contests, parades, dances, rodeos, or races.  A listing of fund allocations under this section containing the names of all premium and prize winners, including the amount and value of all awards, shall be maintained by the fair association.

###### Sec. 03.20.030.   Application for and granting of operation and maintenance aid.

(a) Each agricultural and industrial fair association desiring to apply for an operation and maintenance grant shall apply to the commissioner before August 1 of the year preceding the fiscal year for which the grant is sought. It shall submit with the application a planned program of operation and maintenance of the proposed fair, the rules and regulations governing the fair, and a certificate signed by the president and secretary of the association certifying that the association will spend for the proposed fair a sum of money from their own funds equal in amount to the benefits requested under AS 03.20.010 — 03.20.080. When satisfied that the association is entitled to receive state aid under the provisions of AS 03.20.010 — 03.20.080, the commissioner shall make a disbursement to the association in the sum to which it is entitled. The commissioner shall pay annually the sum to be paid under the provisions of AS 03.20.010 — 03.20.080.

(b) The commissioner shall require each association receiving state operation and maintenance aid to furnish receipts for money paid to them.  The commissioner may prescribe the form of the receipt. Each association shall furnish a statement executed and acknowledged by the president and secretary, covering the disbursements by the association of all operation and maintenance funds, for fairs held under AS 03.20.010 — 03.20.080.  The statement must definitely set forth that wherever any state aid money has been disbursed that a like amount of fair association fund money has been expended and that in no instance has the expenditure of state money exceeded the expenditure of fair association money.  The association shall make a full report of receipts and expenditures including the sums expended for prizes and awards to the commissioner and this report shall be transmitted to the next legislature.

(c) A sum equal to at least 25 percent of the state operation and maintenance aid received under AS 03.20.010 — 03.20.080 shall be used for premiums or transportation cost of exhibits.

###### Sec. 03.20.035.   Application for and granting of capital improvement aid.

(a) Each agricultural and industrial fair association desiring to apply for a capital improvement grant shall apply to the commissioner before August 1 of the year preceding the fiscal year for which the grant is sought. It shall submit with the application a proposed long-term capital improvement plan of the fair covering five years from the time the application is submitted, which shall be certified by the president and secretary of the association as having been reviewed and approved by the governing body of the association. When satisfied that the association is entitled to receive state aid under the provisions of this section, the commissioner shall make a disbursement to the association in the sum to which it is entitled.

(b) Each association receiving state capital improvement aid shall furnish receipts to the commissioner for money paid to them. The commissioner shall prescribe the form of the receipt. The association shall make a full report of its receipts and expenditures made for capital improvements and this report shall be transmitted to the next legislature following the receipts and expenditures.

###### Sec. 03.20.040.   Display of exhibits outside state.

The commissioner may collect and ship, for display outside of the state, exhibits of Alaska produce, mining, and manufacturing, and other exhibits, including the Native arts.

When more than one association applies for the benefits of AS 03.20.010 — 03.20.080, the commissioner shall divide the money allotted to the district among the applicants in proportion to the amount justified at the time of application.

###### Sec. 03.20.060.   Expenditure of aid for nonperishable exhibits.

(a) If an association has received state operation and maintenance funds under AS 03.20.010 — 03.20.080 and fails to hold a fair in accordance with its program, or does not disburse all of the state funds paid to it for that purpose, the association shall return those funds, or the unexpended portions, to the department within 60 days after the date set for the fair.  If an association fails to comply with this section the attorney general shall institute proceedings to recover the funds.

(b) If an association has received state capital improvement funds under AS 03.20.010 — 03.20.080 and fails to expend them within five years for capital improvements designated in its long-term capital improvement plan in effect at the time of the grant, the commissioner may, after investigation, require that the unexpended funds be returned to the department.
